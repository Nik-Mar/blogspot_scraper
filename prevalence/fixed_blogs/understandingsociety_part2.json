[{"title": "Farms in historical materialism", "date": "Sunday, May 3, 2009", "text": "Materialist explanations in history generally attempt to discover fundamental features of technology and labor that impose a very deep imprint on the rest of society.  Farming is almost always fundamental in this respect; the forces and relations of production are particularly visible, and the products of the farm system are fundamental to the survival of society.  The standard of living of a traditional society is largely determined by agricultural productivity and the nature of the farming system -- nutrition, for example, is essentially determined by the ratio of total grain output to population.  Finally, virtually all traditional economies are primarily rural; so farm life defines the conditions of ordinary social existence for the majority of the population.   So let us consider a brief analysis of the farm. (A. V. Chayanov's classic treatment of the peasant economy, The Theory of Peasant Economy, written in the 1920s, remains highly valuable.  Robert Allen's lifetime of research on the English farm economy is highly insightful (Enclosure and the Yeoman: The Agricultural Development of the South Midlands, 1450-1850), as is Bozhong Li's work on the farm economy of the Lower Yangzi (Agricultural Development in Jiangnan, 1620-1850).)A farm is the basic unit of agricultural production.  It represents the coordinated application of diverse factors of production in order to produce crops.  The factors of production include labor; land; tools, implements, and machinery; fertilizers; and water resources and irrigation techniques.  Crops include both foods (e.g., rice, wheat, millet) and raw materials (e.g., cotton, soya beans).  And farms may be organized for a variety of purposes: to satisfy a family's subsistence needs, to create a profit within a market system, or to provide employment for the greatest number of rural people.Farms in different agrarian regimes may be characterized in terms of a set of technical and social features.  On the technical side we need to know what the scale of cultivation is (farm size); what techniques of cultivation are employed; what varieties of crops and seeds are available; what types of farm tools and machines are used; what types of irrigation, if any, are in use; what varieties and skills of labor are employed; what types of fertilizers are used; and what forms of agronomic knowledge are available to the farmer.  (We might reduce this variety of technical features to a spectrum ranging from low-technology to high-technology farming systems.)  On the social side we need to know the purpose of cultivation (family subsistence or commercial profitability); the form of land tenure in place (fixed rent, sharecropping, smallholding, etc.); the forms of labor employed (slave, serf, family labor, hired labor); the forms of supervision employed; and the processes of income distribution embodied in the agricultural system.These features are the primary subject of research for agricultural historians such as Allen and Li.  These features essentially determine the most important economic characteristics of the agricultural system.  First, they determine the productivity of the farming system, whether measured in terms of land efficiency (output per hectare) or labor efficiency (output per man-day).  For once we know the techniques of cultivation in a given ecological setting, it is possible to form relatively accurate estimates of output for a given input of land, labor, and capital.  This set of considerations also determines what we might describe as the net rural product--the total agricultural product over and above the replacement cost of the factors of production.  On this basis, Chinese historians such as Dwight Perkins attempt to estimate the overall wealth and income of late Imperial China, including estimates of quality of life for the majority of rural people (Agricultural development in China, 1368-1968).Second, the full description of the farming system as indicated above will allow us to infer the system of surplus extraction in place; it will be possible to indicate with adequate precision how much surplus is generated and where it goes.   Victor Lippit attempts to arrive at such an estimate for traditional China (Land Reform and Economic Development in China: A Study of Institutional Change and Development Finance).  This in turn permits us to describe the system of rural class relations that correspond to a given farming regime.Within this framework we can now indicate a variety of types of farms; and as a working premise, we may postulate that agrarian regimes in which different farm types are dominant will have distinctive patterns of organization and development.  The following are advanced as ideal types; variants and mixed examples are possible as well.  However, these types are selected as being particularly central in the development of both Asian and European traditional economies.  And, significantly for the historian of social change, each farming system creates a distinctive pattern of incentives, barriers, social relations, and modes of behavior that have important consequences for historical change.The peasant farm.  The peasant farm is small (1-10 hectares), and is organized to satisfy consumption needs of the family.  It is managed and run by a peasant family using family labor.  Cultivation is divided between subsistence crops and commercial crops with some risk-aversive preference for subsistence crops.  There is a very low level of capital available to the peasant farmer, and cultivation is oriented towards labor-intensive techniques.  Low-cost traditional techniques and tools are employed in cultivation.  The peasant cultivator typically pays rent on the land he cultivates, though smallholding with clear title to the land is also possible.The manor.  This farm is of medium size (100 hectares).  It is managed by a resident lord whose aims are (1) to satisfy the consumption needs of his household, and (2) to produce a marketable surplus to generate cash income.  The manor employs a sizable number of bonded laborers (serfs or slaves); it uses traditional techniques of cultivation but benefits from some economies of scale; and it employs foremen as supervisors.  Part of the estate is farmed by individual families in circumstances of peasant farming.The capitalist farm.  This farm is medium to large (50-150 hectares) and is organized to produce a profit.  It is therefore located within a commercialized rural economy within which crops may be readily marketed.  The farm is organized and directed by the capitalist farmer, who may either own or rent the land.  The capitalist farmer has the fiscal resources needed to make capital investments in the process of cultivation; and he is oriented towards cost-cutting in considering various alternative techniques.  The capitalist farm employs wage labor, where the wage is determined by local economic circumstances and the minimal cost of subsistence.  The capitalist farm represents a rationalization of available techniques aimed at maximizing the profitability of the unit.The cooperative farm.  The cooperative farm is a large unit (100-400 hectares) owned by the cultivators (75 families).  This farm is oriented towards profitability; it uses the labor of the cultivators; and it is organized by a council of the cultivators.  The collective has access to investment funds, and is therefore able to invest in new techniques; moreover, the collective farm benefits from economies of scale.Significantly, this typology of farming units corresponds broadly to the classical Marxist taxonomy of modes of production: feudalism, capitalism, and socialism.  The peasant farm, however, represents a form of organization of the productive forces of rural society that is overlooked in Marxist theory: call it the \"peasant mode of production.\"  The peasant mode of production may be defined as a system in which agriculture is performed on peasant farms; the bulk of the population consists of free peasant cultivators; and agricultural surpluses are extracted through rent, interest, and taxation.In short, careful analysis of the circumstances of farming is crucial for large-scale history, including especially the history of economic development, the history of urbanization, and the history of human well-being.  And, of course, the twentieth century demonstrated the centrality of peasants in the great political movements of revolution and anti-colonialism."}, {"title": "Being clumsy", "date": "Friday, May 1, 2009", "text": "We've probably all been clumsy from time to time -- knocking over the teacup on the desk when reaching for a pencil, dropping a jar when moving from the kitchen to the table, tripping on an uneven bit of sidewalk when walking the dog. We sometimes refer to this kind of behavioral mistake as \"maladroit\".Can we give an explanation of clumsy behavior?Here as elsewhere, a little conceptual work is helpful. We might characterize a clumsy event as \"an inadvertent negative result of a series of bodily movements intended to accomplish something else altogether.\" And, it would seem, we need to add a characteristic of causation into the definition: the negative result came about as a consequence of the agent's series of actions and movements -- not simply an unfortunate coincidence. The actor bears responsibility for the negative result in some way. (We wouldn't call it \"clumsy\" if I knock over the glass of wine because the waiter has just placed it at my elbow and out of my visual range; rather, this is simply an accident.)It is also useful to consider the contrast that is intended by the use of the concept. The contraries of \"clumsy\" seem to include adjectives such as skillful, adroit, agile, graceful, or deft. (And consider whether there are nuances of differences among even these positive valence adjectives.) The idea of the degree of bodily control exercised by the actor comes into all of these concepts, both negative and positive. The agile and graceful person -- an athlete or a dancer -- is praised for his/her ability to place the body in exactly the way she wishes to. The clumsy person trips, drops, smashes, and spills -- that is, he/she lacks the ability to control the results of bodily movements.So \"clumsy\" is a feature of bodily performance, in which the intended course of affairs has gone wrong. It is a defect of performance and, derivatively, a defect of competence. A clumsy person is one who is prone to committing more than his/her share of clumsy actions. To refer to a movement or a person as clumsy is to find fault (though perhaps without blame); it is to highlight a deviation between what we expect of normal behavior and the observed behavior.So what is the standard of competence and performance that we implicitly have in mind when we deploy the standards of \"adroit\" and \"clumsy\" when it comes to physical performances? It's something like this. We recognize, first, that every physical action is actually a complex and orchestrated series of component movements. To catch a high fly ball requires the outfielder to predict the destination of the ball; to organize his leg and body movements in order to run to the destination; to prepare for the leap into the air; to extend the glove arm and snag the ball. But more prosaically, to pour a glass of water has a lot of the same complexity of orchestrated movements and calculations. Both activities require \"body intelligence\" -- an active (unconscious) process of orchestration of sub-movements into larger perfomances.Second, there is a substantial amount of knowledge gathering, calculation, and projection that is required in order for the actor to form a cognitive map of the arena of action: where the target will be at a particular point in time, what obstacles exist in the environment, and how the bodily movements need to be orchestrated on such a way as to avoid the obstacles and achieve the desired outcome. The waiter approaching the table to refill the water glasses is illustrative: he/she needs to observe and record the placement of the guests, their glasses, the floral arrangements, and the random items on the table; he needs to approach in such a way as to avoid contacting the guest or spilling the water on the guest; he needs to navigate the pitcher past the guest and between the flower arrangements; bring the pitcher adjacent to the water glass; and pour just enough water into the glass to fill it. Mission accomplished, he needs to withdraw the pitcher without knocking over the flowers or spilling on the guest. And, since the guests are in motion, be needs to regularly update the representation of the field of play and be alert to the possibility of sudden movements by the guest.In other words, we expect quite a lot from the \"adroit\" waiter from the point of view of active knowledge gathering and skillful orchestration of movements based on the current cognitive map -- representation of the world and management of the body.  The adroit person is one who has a reasonably good representation of the physical spaces around himself/herself; has a reasonably good ability to project the future configuration of the space; and has a reasonably high ability to orchestrate the series of movements needed to accomplish a task and a high ability to bring the body to implement the resulting series of steps.So where does \"clumsy\" come into this story? Evidently, clumsy mistakes can derive from any of these three sources. The cognitive representation of the field may be incorrect or glaringly incomplete (the waiter may have failed to note that the guest is particularly tall and consequently bumped his head in his forward motion) (faulty representation). Second, the waiter may miscalculate times and distances -- he may think he can just clear the guest's arm gestures as he passes with the water pitcher (faulty calculation). Or he may have a faulty ability to orchestrate his own physical movements. He intends to touch the pitcher to the lip of the water glass, but he over-shoots and breaks the glass (faulty orchestration and/or faulty implementation).So now we might speculate a bit: a clumsy person may be clumsy in virtue of deficiencies in any of the three areas -- representation, calculation, and orchestration -- and the nature of the clumsy performance is different for each of the three forms of deficiency. The first person may be clumsy because he/she doesn't pay a lot of attention to the field of play; builds up an incomplete representation of the placement of the furniture; and, as a result, bumbles into the footstool or the coffee table. Or there may be another sort of cognitive defect -- for example, a limited ability to remember the features of the cognitive map that has been developed -- he keeps forgetting the footstool. The second person may have a deficient ability to project future states of the field of play based on its current state. He sees the revolving door in front of him, but mis-estimates how quickly it is moving and collides with it. The third person may have a full and sufficient cognitive representation of the field of play; may be fully able to run the dynamics forward in time through mental calculation; but may have difficulty in arranging the movements of the body accordingly. And this deficiency in turn may derive from various causes -- a defective implementation of the routines of motion, an awkward geometry of the body so there is systematic misplacement of the feed, a slow neurological process leading to body movements that aren't quite in synch, ...And here is one final thing we might observe, based on this treatment. A single clumsy act can be explained as the result of a single moment of bad performance -- lapsing of attention to the environment, failing to calculate carefully the relevant future states, stumbling. An enduring characteristic of clumsiness, on the other hand, invites an explanation based on a feature of deficient competence in one of the areas mentioned above -- a chronic problem in the actor's cognition of the environment, or the actor's ability to project future states, or the actor's ability to orchestrate and control the movements of the body. And, if we were in the \"clumsy-therapy\" business, we might try to identify where the deficiency lies and then try to find ways of improving the actor's competence in this area.What kind of analysis is this? Partially it is an ordinary language analysis, along the lines of J. L. Austin. It involves diving into the nuances of meaning that we have in mind when we describe certain actions as \"clumsy.\" But partly it is a phenomenological inquiry: what is the state of mind and body that is associated with committing \"clumsy\" mistakes? What is the \"life world\" of imperfect performance? (Hubert Dreyfus (A Phenomenology of Skill Acquisition), Samuel Todes (Body and World), and Richard Sennett (The Craftsman) capture different parts of this perspective.) And, finally, it is a bit of speculative cognitive psychology; it is an attempt to work out the structure of the cognitive and motor activities that need to occur in the normal performance of activities like catching a fly ball or pouring a glass of water. And, based on this schematic analysis, it is an effort to see how the mistake of \"clumsiness\" can emerge from normal skilled performance. This is analogous to Noam Chomsky's inventive use of grammatical \"mistakes\" as a clue to the underlying grammatical competence possessed by normal language users."}, {"title": "Acting, deliberating, performing", "date": "Monday, April 27, 2009", "text": "Earlier posts have addressed aspects of action -- particularly the features that align action with purposiveness and choice, deliberation, planning, and improvisation. Here I'd like to focus on the idea of action as a performance -- a series of behaviors meaningfully orchestrated by the actor out of consideration of an expected \"script\". Here we interpret actions as falling into scripts and roles, created by the culture's history and constituting the actor's behaviors as a performance. The agent is postulated to possess a stock of mini-scripts and role expectations that are then invoked into a \"syntax\" of performance in specific social settings.The anthropologist Victor Turner makes central use of this framework in constructing his ethnographies (Dramas, Fields, and Metaphors: Symbolic Action in Human Society). He refers to this approach as dramaturgical ethnography. The idea here is that social groups -- cultures -- have created for themselves a set of schemes of ways of behaving that individuals internalize and play out as social settings arise. There is the role of the doctor, the salesman, the librarian, the clown, and the general, and the individuals who assume those roles know the scripts. So when they interact in social settings relevant to their roles, their behaviors reflect the role and the script.  The scripts become part of the furniture of \"behavioral cognition\" -- the routines the players string together in ordinary and extraordinary social settings. (Note the parallel with Erving Goffman's treatment of everyday behavior (post).)  And, perhaps, the script governs the social actor so deeply that his/her behavior no longer has its own individual meaning or intention. (It is said that Gary Cooper never saw his role in High Noon as the anti-McCarthyism allegory that most people on the progressive side of the spectrum take it to be.)What does this framework imply about the actor's state of mind in performing an action? How much agency do actors maintain under this theory?  And to what extent is the actor's conduct his own, deriving from his or her own authentic self rather than from an externally created role?  Consider as an example, a fire captain's behaviors and speeches during his management of the fire company's handling of a major fire. Let's amplify the story a bit. The captain and the members of the company have a well-rehearsed set of procedures for various scenarios encountered in fighting a fire -- \"victim trapped in bedroom\", \"elderly person inside\", \"possible toxic materials on site\", \"roof collapse imminent\". As these contingencies arise, captain and company play out the prescribed actions. Second, though, there is probably a prescribed style of command that influences the captain's manner and conduct: be calm, give sufficient attention to the company's safety, keep control of the press and crowd on-site, don't fall into a screaming, cursing rage when things go badly. (Think of Captain Sullenberger's methodical double sweep of the USAir passenger cabin after landing his disabled aircraft on the Hudson River, before exiting for his own chance of rescue.)So there are fairly tangible ways in which the behaviors of the commander and the company are in fact governed by scripts and roles. The dramaturgical interpretation makes sense here.  The actions of these participants are not invented de novo on the scene of the fire; rather, they derive from earlier practice of roles and, more intangibly, carrying out of a certain conception of behavior of a commander under stress. We don't get actions here that derive from unadorned actors, considering a range of choices and choosing the best in the circumstances.But neither do we get the opposite extreme -- robots playing out their scripts without intelligence or adaptation to circumstance. Instead, each of the players in this story retains his/her own assessment of what is currently going on and what deviations of script may be demanded. The captain retains the ability and the responsibility to break with procedures when there is an imminent reason to do so; and this degree of autonomy extends down the line of command to the junior firefighter. So the routines and scripts guide rather than generate the behavior.So the performative interpretation of social action is not inherently inconsistent with the idea of intelligent, purposive action. Instead, we can think of the actor in this case -- captain or junior firefighter -- as involving in a complicated series of behaviors that reflect both deliberation and internalized script.  I think this interpretation is very analogous to Pierre Bourdieu's position on the subject of habitus in Outline of a Theory of Practice. Conduct that is guided by norms (in this case, scripts and roles) can nonetheless also be intelligent and strategic. Seen in this light, the dramaturgical interpretation supplements the purposive theory of action rather than replaces it.It is challenging to get the balance right, though, between the compulsion of a set of norms or scripts and the practical freedom the actor maintains at every point to act differently than the prescription. It seems unavoidable that the kinds of scripts, roles, and norms mentioned here have some binding power over the agent in actual social life. Much of the time the behavior simply plays out the script, with no homunculus reconsidering the action from the point of view of other possible choices. And often the role or norm is psychologically compelling to the extent that the actor can't realistically consider breaking it. Today's British newspapers break a mini-scandal in which an environmental activist is pressured by the Scottish police to serve as a paid secret informant (story). They offer a substantial amount of money and immunity from otherwise scary criminal charges for her cooperation. Rather than accepting their terms she bugs her meeting with them with her cellphone and exposes the police effort. Why? Presumably because her understanding of her role as a principled activist with the courage of her convictions made accepting this offer humiliating and impossible. (Think, though, how many people made a different choice in the GDR when confronted by the Ministry for State Security (Stasi).)"}, {"title": "Creativity, convention, and tradition", "date": "Sunday, April 26, 2009", "text": "images: Picasso, Portrait of Gertrude Stein (1906); Courbet, Burial at Ornans (1849)Conventions define how to do things correctly -- trim the hedges, choose an outfit for an evening at the opera or the racetrack, how much to tip the server. They also define or constrain productions in the arts -- writing a short story or a sonnet, performing a Brahms quintet, participating in an Andean flute group. We might define a convention as a stylized but unwritten rule of performance.  A tradition is an extended set of conventions for a given area of performance. We can refer to traditions of classical German chamber composition, Japanese landscape painting, or hiphop street performance.  A conventional act or performance, then, is one that directly and consistently expresses the relevant conventions.So -- at any given time, a particular set of conventions drive the creation of works of culture and guide the interpretation of the product.  These conventions are somehow embedded in the community of creators, viewers, and critics.  And innovation, breaking or stretching the rules, creates the possibility of novelty and creativity within the process.  It is important to notice, though, that conventions generally don't govern every aspect of a performance. The convention of the sonnet mandates a form and meter and gives some constraint on subject. But it would certainly be possible to write a sonnet in deviant meter in praise of a farm tractor; the audience would be able to make sense of the production. So the artist always has a degree of freedom within the tradition.I find several specific ideas to be useful in analyzing cultural conventions and their products -- in particular, \"idiom\", \"voice\", and \"novelty\". Within a given medium, there is an existing stock of shorthand ways of expressing an artistic or symbolic idea. We may refer to these modes of expression as \"idioms\" of the genre. When the stranger in the 1950s western is wearing a black hat, the audience understands he is the villain. When the soundtrack swells in an ominous minor key the audience knows there is trouble coming. These idioms aren't natural signifiers; rather, they are conventions of the B movie.  So the idioms of a genre are a particularly direct form of convention within the semiotics of the genre.\"Voice\" is a counterpart of originality. It is the intangible \"signature\" that the individual artist brings to his or her work -- what Eisenstein brings to many of his films, distinctive from Bergman and Kurosawa.  Voice represents a kind of consistency over time, but it is not defined by homage to tradition; instead, it is an expression of the specific sensibility of the individual artist, the specific way in which this artist forges together his/her material and vision within the resources of the genre and its conventions. Eisenstein's films aren't formulaic, even though one can recognize a common sensibility running through them.What about novelty and creativity? Novelty is the break outside of convention that the artist brings to the production in order to express a particular idea or perspective in a new and forceful way -- for example, the transition from sepia to color in The Wizard of Oz. The original and genuinely creative artist or writer finds ways of bringing novelty and his/her own originality into the production, giving the audience new and unexpected insights and ideas. The element of innovation needs to point the audience towards its signification without relying wholly on the existing traditions of reading. (Picasso's portrait above of Gertrude Stein displeased some friends of the writer because \"it doesn't resemble Gertrude Stein.\" Picasso is said to have replied, \"It will.\")But here is an apparent conundrum of creativity and convention. Any performance or artistic work that is wholly determined by the relevant conventions is, for that reason, wholly uncreative. It is like a conversation in a Dashiell Hammett novel: no surprises, each gambit programmed by the conventions of the crime novel. Or it is like a string quartet composed by an earnest follower of Beethoven, with no phrase breaking the flow, no note out of place. And for the careful listener, each is ultimately boring; there is no novelty in the work. And there is no opening for the original and creative voice of the creator. Originality and new perspective have no place.But now the other half of the conundrum: novelty without regard to the frame of tradition is incomprehensible and meaningless. The classical composer of 1800 who somehow heard the world atonally, arhythmically, and to the accompaniment of falling trash cans and who then wrote a symphony in thirty movements on this basis -- this composer is innovating, all right. But he/she is not creating works that any existing audience could hear as \"music\". There is no bridge of meaning or hermeneutic practice to facilitate interpretation.It is relevant here that we are led to refer to the audience. Because cultural products require the conveying of meaning; and communication of meaning requires some reference to conventions shared with the audience -- whether in music, painting, literature, or hiphop. Meaning of any cultural performance is inherently public, and this means there have to be publicly shared standards of interpretation. The audience can only interpret the performance by relating it to some set of conventions or other. These may be conventions of representation, structure, or mythology; but the audience needs some clues in order to be able to \"read\" the work.There are, of course, periods in art history where it appears that innovation is all and continuous convention is nothing. For example, Courbet and the realist painters were evidently shocking to the viewing public for their dismissal of the classical values of the Salon -- in the Burial at Ornans above, for example. But really, there was a great deal of continuity within the context of which the realist manifesto was shocking to the public.  (T. J. Clark does a great job of \"reading\" the painting for its continuities with previous traditions of painting and the sources of its originality; Image of the People: Gustave Courbet and the 1848 Revolution, pp. 80-83.)So what does all of this imply about \"creative breakthroughs\" in the genres of the arts? It seems to imply that major and culturally significant breakthroughs occur when talented people fully absorb the semantic (and historically specific) conventions that define the genre at the current time; he/she finds ways of squeezing every bit of new meaning out of these conventions in the production of the cultural product; he/she plays with the limits of the convention, testing them for the possibility of forging new meanings; and sometimes, he/she breaks a convention altogether and substitutes a new meaning maker in its place (presenting Julius Caesar in the garb of fascist Italy of the 1930s, for example).These topics are relevant to understanding society, because this dialectic of convention, innovation, and meaning-making is virtually pervasive in everyday life. Jokes, business meetings, and street demonstrations all have some elements of this dance of meaning, convention, and originality. So it is important to gain greater understanding of the intersection of convention and innovation.(There are numerous unanswered questions raised by this topic.  How is a tradition of painting or composition related to a scientific or technological tradition?  How is a literary or artistic tradition related to a \"style\" of technology or a scientific research programme?  How can we take measure of \"radical innovators\" in the arts such as Jackson Pollock and abstract expressionism, or John Cage and American experimentalism in composition?  And how do beauty or aesthetic value come into this equation? What are the qualities of a work of art that lead us to say, \"That is beautiful!\" or \"that is hideous!\"?  What are the threads of convention, form, meaning, and originality that contribute to great aesthetic value?)"}, {"title": "Mobilizing a movement", "date": "Wednesday, April 22, 2009", "text": "The red shirt demonstrations in Bangkok are very interesting. Throughout March 2009 there were massive demonstrations involving tens of thousands of people. They are mostly supporters of the National United Front of Democracy against Dictatorship (UDD; also designated as DAAD), the mass party of former prime minister Thaksin. And generically they are in opposition to the current government and to the yellow shirt movement that brought it to power in street demonstrations in fall 2008. (These demonstrations succeeded in forcing the closure of Bangkok's airports, which was significant because it threatened the tourist economy upon which Thailand depends.)The social composition of the red shirt movement is loosely described as consisting primarily of poor people, largely from rural parts of Thailand. The media coverage also makes it clear that the red shirt movement is able to call upon the support of thousands of urban Bangkok people, including taxi drivers. Their immediate demand is for the resignation of the current government, which came to power through undemocratic means. But more generally, the movement seems to call for greater social equality in Thailand and greater democracy.The question I want to raise here is a pretty limited one but theoretically crucial. It concerns the processes of mobilization through which these tens of thousands of people were induced to travel to Bangkok and involve themselves in extended and increasingly risky demonstrations. In general, massive demonstrations don't just happen; they need organization and planning. How did this mobilization transpire? What national, regional, and local organizations brought it about? I don't have the expertise to answer the question, so I'm putting the issue out here, in the hope that some of the commentators on the #redshirt twitter feed will help with some specifics.There are a number of different ways in which this mass mobilization might have happened.One is through the efforts of an effective and extended party organization. It might be the case that UDD is a well-organized and well-financed organization with numerous professional activists in the countryside. There may be village- and town-based UDD offices that maintain a regular presence at the grass-roots level. The activists may be experienced at keeping the grievances alive, keeping political sentiments aroused, and -- when the time is right -- they may have the capacity to mobilize bus-loads of adherents for the trip to Bangkok. On this scenario, mobilization is analogous to the \"get out the vote\" processes through which political parties in the United States mobilize their supporters at the polls on election day.Here's a second way the mobilization could work. UDD might be an umbrella organization at the urban center with little grasp into the countryside and villages; but it may loosely lead a number of independent organizations that have a substantial presence in rural areas. Then, through coalition politics and a degree of high-profile leadership, the center and the coalition partners may call for mobilization, and coalition activists at the local level may take the organizational steps needed to elicit hundreds of bus loads of volunteers. This is a bit more challenging than the first scenario from the point of view of maintaining political unity -- each partner may have a somewhat different agenda -- but may be more feasible from the point of view of the level of resources needed by the central party. Here is a posting from April 9 in New Mandala that seems to suggest this type of mechanism.I suppose there is a third logical possibility as well: a reasonably well-organized central party, no regional partners, but a mobilization that results simply from a widely broadcast \"call to action\". Crudely -- UDD leaders call for large street demonstrations; the call is broadcast on friendly mass media; and tens of thousands of rural people heed the call and make their way to Bangkok.Naturally, we can ask exactly the same kinds of questions about the yellow shirt movement; and it is possible that the answers will be different in the two cases.  I don't have any way of knowing whether any of these scenarios is close to the realities in Thailand today. But it is worth knowing, and there are many smart observers in Thailand who can shed light on the matter. So, Thai tweeters, how does it work?"}, {"title": "Understanding across generations", "date": "Monday, April 20, 2009", "text": "Cohorts sometimes have very different formative experiences. Perhaps this means that they form different ways of taking the world in -- different expectations, different paradigms of how things work, different basic reactions about how to behave. And, in turn, perhaps this makes intergenerational understanding difficult; both younger and older may need to engage in real hermeneutic effort to make sense of each other.This is often said to be the case for the US birth generations of 1920 and 1950. The former experienced the Great Depression, Tommy Dorsey, World War II, and the atom bomb. The latter experienced Woodstock, Jimmie Hendrix, the Beatles, and the war in Vietnam. The values of thrift, self-sufficiency, and sacrifice attached easily to the \"Greatest Generation\". Questioning authority, personal freedom in all things, and a weird combination of political engagement and personal narcissism formed the nimbus of the sixties generation.These truly were very different social, familial, and economic circumstances for the two successive generations. But is it clear that these differences amounted to differences in worldview deep enough to make mutual comprehension difficult? Or are these differences overstated in films and novels (Death of a Salesman, The Graduate, Appocalypse Now), but really small beer in actual fact?Part of the answer depends on what we think is involved in \"understanding\" the inner lives and external behavior of others. We observe people's behavior in specific circumstances -- how they treat their friends or children, how they handle important social obligations like the draft, or how they react to tragedy and loss; and we try to reconstruct how they think, feel, and reason. We try to form an idea of what they care about, what they value, and what kinds of principles they honor.Part of what we mean when we judge we just don't understand the other person's actions, is that we can't assimilate their behavior to anything like our own core values and commitments. Likewise, we have the greatest sense of understanding when the other's conduct is compatible with our own values; we judge \"she's pretty much like me in a core way.\"When the other's behavior deviates widely from our own values and perceptions -- like Darnton's apprentices in their massacre of Parisian cats, or like the war protester pissing on a flag in the view of the sixtyish VFW witness -- we have to get more actively hermeneutic: what is the perception and valuation of the situation possessed by the other, in light of which his action makes sense to him? We have to actively reconstruct an interpretation of the other person's mental framework.One thing we know from everyday experience: friendship and extended interaction leads to hermeneutic learning between people with very different starting points. So the fact that we begin with little in common doesn't ensure that we'll stay in that place. But this takes effort, and if there isn't a basis of friendship and mutual respect we may not get there. It explains, too, why parents and their children often do succeed in understanding each other in spite of these generational differences: they care enough to try to figure each other out.But maybe the example of mid-century America is a pretty clear case; maybe it's true that the world of the VFW sixty-year-old in 1970 is different enough from the draft-resisting protester that they are mutually opaque. They each need the skills of a Geertz or a Maslau to have a meaningful conversation with each other.But what about today? Are there hermeneutic gaps as wide as this between the 1950, 1970, and 1990 cohorts? Is it possible that the experiences of people now sixty and now twenty-five are just as wide? Are the young truly foreign to the middle-aged? And for that matter -- is it true that sixty is today's forty?"}, {"title": "Objectivity and bias in complex happenings", "date": "Sunday, April 19, 2009", "text": "Complicated things happen: riots occur, military coups take place, governments collapse.  The happenings consist of a myriad of events and actions, many social actors, and a range of political interests and grievances.  We want to know what happened; who did what; and who is responsible for the course that events took.  It is one of the tasks of journalists, commentators, and historians to arrive at accounts of complicated things that answer many of these questions.  And we want those accounts to be objective, truthful, and unbiased.  Each account is a creative act of selection and narrative construction; the analyst has to sort out the evidence that is available to him or her and arrive at a chronology and a causal interpretation that makes sense, based on the evidence.What we want from the historian and the journalist is easily described, though achieved with difficulty.  We want an account that provides an accurate and truthful narrative of the events, based on the best available factual and historical information.  We want an account that avoids the biases of the actors, including especially those of the most powerful actors who have the greatest capacity to shape the story -- the government, the military, and the major parties.  We want an investigator who is able to question his/her own initial assumptions -- sympathy for the underdog, patient acceptance of the government's good intentions, or whatever.  And we want a narrative that provides a balanced synthesis of the many events of the time period into a storyline with a degree of coherence: what the major events were, what choices were made by the actors, what the motivations of the actors were, and perhaps -- who acted responsibly and who acted recklessly or out of narrow self-interest.It has to be acknowledged at the start that there are often multiple truthful, unbiased narratives that can be told for a complex event.  Exactly because many things happened at once, actors' motives were ambiguous, and the causal connections among events are debatable, it is possible to construct inconsistent narratives that are equally well supported by the evidence.  Further, the intellectual interest that different reporters bring to the happening can lead to differences in the narrative: one reporter may be primarily interested in the role that different views of social justice played in the actions of the participants; another may be primarily interested in the role that social networks played, so the narrative is structured around network connections; and a third may be especially interested in the role of charismatic personalities, with a consequent structuring to the narrative.  Each of these may be truthful, objective, unbiased -- and inconsistent in important ways with the others.  So narratives are underdetermined by the facts.  And there is no such thing as an exhaustive and comprehensive telling of the story -- only various tellings that emphasize one set of themes or another.  That said -- it is entirely possible that a given event will have provided enough factual data in the form of witness reports, government documents, YouTube videos, etc., that the main sequence of events, cast of actors and responsibility for events are unambiguous.The example I'm thinking of in particular is the recent period of demonstration and riot in Bangkok involving red shirts, followers of former prime minister Thaksin, and the government and military.   (See several other posts here and here.)  But other examples are easily found: the taking of the Bastille, the Haymarket Square riot in Chicago (pictured above), the return of Franco to Malaga, or the decision of General MacArthur to cross the Yalu River in Korea.  Virtually every historical event is a complex happening; so the problems raised here are endemic to historical interpretation.One of the important issues being debated right now in Thailand is the question of arriving at a balanced and fact-based judgment of the amount of force that was used by the military in dispersing the crowds of protesters on April 13-14.  The government reports that it used minimal force -- paper bullets, firm orders to fire above the crowds when using live ammunition, and a very low number of casualties as a result.  Critical observers suspect a different story; based on memories of past repression by the military in times of street demonstrations, there is suspicion that the amount of violence was much greater.  Some commentators speculate that there may have been many more deaths than have been reported and that the bodies were secretly taken away; ambiguous videos are brought forward as evidence for this possibility.  So how are we to sort out the truth of the matter?We can raise the question of objectivity at two levels: the investigator and the narrative.  So let's begin with the narrative itself -- what do we want in a good comprehensive piece of journalism that tells this story accurately and fairly?  We want an account that lays out the causes, events, and actions that made up this period of several weeks of protest and reaction.  We want to know what organizations and leaders took what actions at what time, to call forth what organized responses.  We want to know what key decisions the government made.  We want to know how the prime minister and the police and military deliberated about responses to massive demonstrations.  We want to know how the several occasions of mob violence against officials and offices transpired.  We want to know the crucial details of the final hours of confrontation between the military and the crowd, and the degree of violence that transpired at that point.And what do we want from the investigator of this complex happening in Bangkok?  We want a commitment to arriving at the most truthful account of the story possible; a commitment to considering the full range of empirical and factual evidence available; and an ability to tell the story without regard to one's antecedent affinities and loyalties. It shouldn't be a \"yellow shirt\" or a \"red shirt\" story; it should be a factual story, based on critical reading and assessment of the available evidence.  In order to arrive at such an account, the honest reporter needs to exercise critical good sense about the sources and the interests that the conveyors of the information have: the biases of the government, the press, and the parties as they provide evidence and interpretation of the events.  And we want this account to be as free as possible of the interfering influences of bias and political interest. We want an honest and comprehensive synthesis, not a one-sided spin.The good news is -- both goals are possible.  The standards and values associated with both good historical writing and good journalism lead at least some investigators to exert their talents and integrity to do the best job they can to use the evidence to discover the details of the story.  Not all journalists are equally committed to these standards -- that's why we prefer the I. F. Stones to the Jayson Blairs of the world.  But enough are committed that we've got a good shot at sorting out the realities and responsibilities of the complex happenings that surround us through their objective, fact-based reporting."}, {"title": "The Franco-Prussian War", "date": "Friday, April 17, 2009", "text": "The rapid, bloody, and total defeat of the French army by the Prussian army in 1870-71 was an enormous and unexpected shock to France and to Europe.  Since the Napoleonic Wars it was taken as given that France's armies were powerful, well-equipped, and well generaled. But the Prussian army quickly defeated French armies across eastern France, from Wissembourg to Sedan, with massive loss of life on the French side.  And the collapse of the army was rapidly followed by the siege of Paris and the Paris uprising leading to the establishment of the Commune of Paris and eventually its bloody suppression.  So this period of two years was a critical moment in France's history in the nineteenth century.Michael Howard's 1961 history, Franco-Prussian War: The German Invasion of France 1870-1871, is probably the most comprehensive book in English on the Franco-Prussian War.  Here's how Howard expresses the the comprehensiveness and shocking totality of France's defeat:The collapse at Sedan, like that of the Prussians at Jena sixty-four years earlier, was the result not simply of faulty command but of a faulty military system; and the military system of a nation is not an independent section of the social system but an aspect of it in its totality.   The French had good reason to look on their disasters as a judgment.  The social and economic developments of the past fifty years had brought about a military as well as an industrial revolution.  The Prussians had kept abreast of it and France had not. Therein lay the basic cause of her defeat. (1)So Howard's judgment of the causes of this massive military failure is ultimately technological and systemic.  The technical changes to which he refers are familiar: the role that railroads could play in the logistics of nineteenth-century warfare (opportunities that needed to be recognized and incorporated into military plans and the design of operational systems); the advent of new infantry weapons (breech-loading rifles of greater range and speed of loading); and new advances in artillery.  The Prussian army incorporated breech-loading rifles (the needle gun) as early as 1843; whereas the French (as well as the British and Austrian armies) retained the muzzle-loader until the 1860s.  And the Prussian generals led major advances in artillery in the decades leading up to the Franco-Prussian war, with greater precision and fire power in their Krup guns.Railroads played a key role in Prussia's mobilization and logistics.  The Prussians were able to maintain coordination and organization of their rail system; whereas the French rail system quickly fell into disorder.  Howard describes the military potential of railroads in these terms:Speed of concentration was only one of the advantages which railways provided.  They carried troops rapidly to the theatre of war; and they enabled them to arrive in good physical condition, not wearied and decimated by weeks of marching.  Armies needed no longer to consist of hardened regular troops; reservists from civil life could be embodied in the force as well.... Further, the problem of supplying large forces in the field was simplified. (3)The systemic part of Howard's diagnosis is a failure of government: a failure to coordinate ministries and the bureaucracy of the military in pushing forward the reforms that would lead to effective incorporation of new technological possibilities into the order of battle and mobilization.  The Prussian army made intelligent use of the General Staff as a learning organization; the French had no comparable organization.Military failure is perhaps best viewed as a single species of organizational failure more generally.  Elliot Cohen and John Gooch offer a different analytical basis for trying to understand the military disaster of the Franco-Prussian War in Military Misfortunes: The Anatomy of Failure in War.  Bad generals can cause military disasters; but Cohen and Gooch take the position that \"human error\" is an explanation we turn to too quickly when it comes to large failures.  (Likewise, \"pilot error\" and \"surgeon error\" are too superficial in aviation and hospital failures.)  Rather, it is important to look for the systemic and organizational causes of failure.  They treat war as a complex organizational activity, and they attempt to discover the causes of military failures in a variety of kinds of organizational failure.  They identify three basic kinds of failure: \"failure to learn, failure to anticipate, and failure to adapt\" (26).  And when these kinds of failure compound in a single period, it is likely enough that the result will be catastrophic failure.Cohen and Gooch offer a fascinating \"matrix of failure\", partitioning \"command level\" (from president down to operating units) and \"critical task\" (communication of warning, appropriate level of alert, coordination) (55); and they demonstrate how mistakes at various levels of command in the several critical tasks can cascade into \"critical failures\".  The cases they analyze include the failure of American antisubmarine warfare, 1942; Israel Defense Forces on the Suez Front and the Golan Heights, 1973; the British at Gallipoli, 1915; the defeat of the American Eighth Army in Korea, 1950; and the French army and airforce, 1940.It seems that the Cohen-Gooch framework can be usefully applied to the Franco-Prussian War.  Each of the key failures occurred: failure to anticipate (especially, failure to anticipate the possible consequences of Prussia's rapid military modernization in the 1850s and 1860s; failure to anticipate the fatal consequences that would follow from the French declaration of war in July 1870); failure to learn (an almost total lack of ability on the part of the French general staff to make sense of the causes of defeat as they occurred in summer and fall 1870); and, most strikingly, a failure to adapt (essentially the same tactics were used at Sedan as had first been applied at Wissembourg; Howard, 204-08).Emile Zola's treatment of the war, The Debacle: 1870-71, is not a piece of analytical history; instead, it is a brilliant novelist's best effort to capture the horror and hopelessness of the campaigning in the summer and fall of 1870 from the point of view of the peasant Jean Macquart. The confusion of endless marches in one direction and then the reverse; the misery of driving rain; the hunger of poorly provisioned campaigning; and the seemingly endless terror of artillery and rifle fire put the reader into the shoes of the foot soldier as he approaches his end. The novel presents a textured and grim picture of the confusion of the march and the terrors of the battlefield:In Remilly there was a dreadful mix-up of men, horses, and vehicles jamming the street which zigzags down the hill to the Meuse. Half way down, in front of the church, some guns had got their wheels locked together and could not be moved in spite of much swearing and banging. At the bottom of the hill, where the Emmane roars down a fall, there was a huge queue of broken-down vans blocking the road, while an ever-growing wave of soldiers was struggling at the Croix de Malte inn (139-40)And a description of fighting in Bazeilles:Clearly the attack was going to be terrible. The fusillade from the meadows had died down. The Bavarians were masters of the little stream fringed with poplars and willows, and were now preparing for an assault on the houses defending the church square, and so their snipers had prudently drawn back. The sun shone in golden splendour on the great stretch of grassland, dotted with a few black patches, the bodies of killed soldiers. (190)Lying on the ground, sheltering behind stones or taking advantage of the slightest projections, the men were firing all out, and along this wide, sunlit and empty street there was a hurricane of lead with streaks of smoke, like a hailstorm blown by a high wind. A young girl was seen running across the road in terror, but she was not hit. But then an old man, a yokel in a smock, was insisting on getting his horse into a stable, and he was struck in the forehead by a bullet with such force that it knocked him into the middle of the road. The roof of the church was blown in by a shell. (191)And here, the fateful trap of Sedan, where the larger part of the French army was annihilated:The hundred thousand men and five hundred cannon of the French army were there packed together and hounded into this triangle. And when the King of Prussia turned westwards he saw another plain, that of Donchery, empty fields extending to Briancourt, Marancourt and Vrigne-aux-Bois, a waste of grey earth, powdery-looking under the blue sky, and when he turned to the east there was yet again, opposite the huddled French lines, an immense vista, a crowd of villages..... In all directions the land belonged to him, he could move at will the two hundred and fifty thousand men and the eight hundred guns of his armies, he could take in with one sweeping look their invading march. (197)It is an interesting question to ask: to what extent do the skills of the novelist complement the theories of the social scientist and the narratives and analysis of the historian, in helping us to come to a better understanding of the reality of the historical moment?  Is Zola's novel a genuine addition to our ability to make sense of this period in France's history?  Or is it simply -- fiction?"}, {"title": "American urban unrest", "date": "Wednesday, April 15, 2009", "text": "photo: Newark, 1967Several recent posts have focused on periods of civil unrest in other countries -- France and Thailand most recently.  The United States has its own history of civil unrest as well; and much of that history involves poverty, race, and cities.  So it's worthwhile taking a look at some of the dynamics and causes of the major urban race riots that have occurred in the United States in the past seventy-five years.   Detroit, Newark, Chicago, and Watts stand out as particularly dramatic moments in American urban history of the late 1960s, and it is useful to tease out some of the historical contingencies and large social conditions that produced these periods of strife.At the crudest level, we can tell a pretty compelling story about why these riots occurred.  The facts of racial segregation and intense poverty and restricted opportunities for African-Americans created an environment where urban African-American youth had seething grievances and a sense of little to lose; a dilapidated and depressing housing stock reinforced this sense of isolation, anger, and hopelessness; and specific incidents triggered an outburst of urban violence against property (the assassination of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.; specific acts of police misconduct; etc.).   So structural conditions (racism, segregation, economic inequality, poverty, and limited opportunities) led to a political psychology of grievance, anger, and hopelessness in a large part of the urban population; and it was only a matter of time before a spark would fall into this tinder.  Riots were predictable given the structural conditions and the resulting psychology.But this is a commonsense folk theory of unrest; what do the experts think?  Janet Abu-Lughod provides a particularly thoughtful and probing history of this subject in Race, Space, and Riots in Chicago, New York, and Los Angeles.   Abu-Lughod is a noted urban sociologist (though notably not a student of social contention in the Tilly school), and her approach is comparative and spatial.  She wants to identify the similarities and differences that exist across a small number of cases of major race riots.  She picks out six riots in three cities (Chicago, New York, and Los Angeles) over a period of about seventy-five years (1919-1992) and employs a method of paired comparisons.  Her goal is to achieve three things:First, I hope to illustrate the changing conditions of urban race relations over time, as these have been affected by internal and international patterns of migration, wars and wartime production demands for labor, legal changes governing housing segregation, and the civil rights movement.Second, I hope to explain variations in riots in the three largest metropolitan regions by examining differences in their demographic compositions, the spatial distributions of racial and ethnic groups within each city, and the degree and patterns of racial segregation in their unique physical settings.Third, I hope to demonstrate differences in the ways relevant city government regimes have responded to sequential outbreaks -- ways that reflect the distinctive power structures of each city and the prior \"social learning\" relevant to race relations that evolved in each place. (8)One of the things that is most original in Abu-Lughod's treatment is the primacy she gives to the spatial features of urban geography and the geography of racial segregation in the various cities.  She believes that spatial characteristics of Chicago, New York, and Los Angeles explain important aspects of the six riots.  But another original contribution is the emphasis she places on sequence and learning: an uprising later in time takes a somewhat different shape because of things that insurgents and authorities have learned from earlier uprisings.  Both insurgents and authorities have \"repertoires\" of tactics that are updated by prior experiences.Spatial considerations come into Abu-Lughod's analysis in several ways: as a source of conflict (over de facto borders between racially defined areas), and a source of logistical difficulties for the authorities when it comes to the challenge of deploying forces to suppress rioters (in Los Angeles, for example). Urban development plans that intrude into black neighborhoods -- for example, the expansion of the University of Illinois campus in Chicago -- are also identified as a spatial process that provokes racial conflict.Abu-Lughod draws several general conclusions based on the pairwise comparisons that she has made.  One important conclusion concerns policing.  She argues that a well-trained, restrained, and disciplined police force is more likely to sustain peace in tumultuous times and less likely to worsen conflicts when they arise (270); whereas undisciplined and violent police forces greatly worsen the degree and duration of conflict.  And second, she argues that the cases suggest that cities in which the city administration has taken steps to enhance trust and collaboration with the organizations of disadvantaged populations will be least likely to suffer major race riots.  \"Where there is ongoing interaction between well-organized protest movements, with leaders capable of articulating specific demands for change, and a responsive local government, the more quickly hostilities can be brought to an end\" (270).  So there are specific steps that cities can take to attempt to reduce the likelihood of prolonged major race riots.But these points don't address the most basic causes of race riots: poverty, segregation, and severe inequalities of opportunity across racial lines.  As she points out, the Kerner Commission in 1968 urged the nation to address these inequalities; the Johnson administration undertook to do so; and very, very little progress has been made in the intervening forty years towards greater social justice along these lines.  So perhaps her most sweeping and penetrating conclusion has to do with the depth and severity of the problems of race, poverty, and segregation we continue to face in American cities, and the likelihood this creates for future major disturbances.Given the obdurate persistence of racism in American culture, and the widening divides in the racial/ethnic/class system over the past three decades (attributable to changes in the international division of labor that have reshaped labor demands in the United States, coupled with massive immigration and a generation of neoliberal national policies that have shred the welfare safety net woven in the Great Depression), I am amazed that major urban rebellions have thus far been so constrained. (269)One thing that this account has not addressed is the element of organizations and leadership. Abu-Lughod presents the riots she treats as if they were simply wholesale reactions of the mass populations of Chicago, New York, or Los Angeles, to a pressing set of structures and grievances.  And this appears to make these periods of strife as being non-strategic -- reactive rather than purposive, expressive rather than political.  But it is a key insight of the resource mobilization approach that we need to spend particular effort at discovering the organizational resources that were available to insurgents; the background thought is that uprisings require mobilization and coordination, and that this is impossible without some sort of organization.  So were there organizational resources that helped to sustain and spread the urban riots of the 1960s?Abu-Lughod doesn't ignore urban activist organizations altogether; for example, she talks about the role of the NAACP and the Urban League in organizing and negotiating skillfully in support of the economic and political interests of African-Americans in New York during periods between major riots. And she refers to the organizational capacity of the Congress of Racial Equality in New York as a substantial asset in the ability of the black community to organize and sustain protests against police brutality in 1964 in Bedford-Stuyvesant. But the periods of strife themselves seem to be largely disorganized, in her narrative, and CORE organizers exerted themselves to damp down the violence rather than sustain it. Generally the civil rights organizations appear to have played the role of peace makers rather than insurgents.A good complement to Abu-Lughod's analysis is Tom Sugrue's recent book, Sweet Land of Liberty: The Forgotten Struggle for Civil Rights in the North.   This is a very careful and detailed treatment of the sustained activism and achievements of major civil rights organizations in the North that were aimed at achieving greater equality for African-Americans.  And it gives a very nuanced appreciation of the degree of political sophistication and activism that existed in the urban African-American communities of the north throughout the 1960s.  Sugrue documents in great detail the strategies and commitment of organizations such as CORE, NAACP, and the Urban League.  But I think Sugrue agrees with the basic view that the rioting itself was not the result of insurgent organization: \"There is little evidence that the urban rebellions of the 1960s were planned, coordinated, and controlled.  What was most striking about the long hot summers was not their coordination or coherence.  Their very spontaneity convinced many leftists that they were manifestations of a popular -- if still undeveloped -- revolutionary consciousness\" (334-35).If this interpretation is correct (spontaneous rioting without organization through such vehicles as street gangs, underground groups, etc.), then the spatial considerations that Abu-Lughod focuses on really are crucial; our explanations of the spread and persistence of violence in these cities depend on neighborhood-level mobilization alone.  And it suggests that American urban riots were somewhat different from insurgency movements in other countries; they are more spontaneous and less organized than the campaigns of the aggrieved mentioned in prior postings (1848 Paris workers, Thai red shirts, student protests in France)."}, {"title": "Thailand's redshirts and civil unrest", "date": "Sunday, April 12, 2009", "text": "photos: Battaya demonstration 4/11/09 (top 2); Bangkok 4/12/09 (bottom)Thailand's civil unrest took a new turn Saturday (4/11/09) when \"redshirt\" demonstrators managed to push through security forces and invade the resort hotel where ministers of ASEAN were preparing to meet.   These demonstrations were organized by the Democratic Alliance Against Dictatorship (DAAD).  The ASEAN meeting was scheduled in the Pattaya beach resort, roughly 90 miles from Bangkok.  (Here are some very graphic photos of the hotel invasion published in a Thai news publication.)   Demonstrators smashed doors and windows in the hotel, raced through the building, and found their way to rooms where several ministers were lunching.  The ministers fled through the back of the hotel and were evacuated by helicopter and boat.  Reports indicate that the early phase of the demonstrations in Pattaya was opposed by local people (\"blueshirts\"), who attempted to block the redshirt march to the resort; but they were quickly overwhelmed by a show of force by the redshirts (report).  The Thai government immediately canceled the ASEAN meeting and evacuated the ministers from the country.  Large demonstrations continue in Bangkok today by redshirt activists, and the situation is unfolding rapidly.  (Here is a GoogleMaps image of the environs of the Royal Cliff Beach Resort (A) where the ASEAN meeting was to occur.)Some commentators describe the basic struggle as one between former prime minister Thaksin Shinawatra's followers who want to see a major redistribution of power and resources in Thai society (redshirts; DAAD), against the forces of the status quo and the powerful and privileged, represented by current prime minister Abhisit (yellowshirts; PAD).  (Others denounce Thaksin's motives as being corrupt and self-serving, more interested in power than social reform.)  Redshirt support tends to draw from poor and unemployed Thais, largely rural, whereas the yellowshirt movement tends to reflect the powerful groups in Thai society, including the military and business elites.  The redshirt demonstrators are supporters of Thaksin and are demanding the resignation of Abhisit.  Thaksin was forced from office in a military coup in September 2006.  Demonstrations by \"yellowshirt\" groups and the People's Alliance for Democracy (PAD) against the government by the People's Power Party allied with Thaksin in September and October 2008 led to the closure of Thailand's major airports and had a large economic impact on Thailand by its effects on tourism.  Abhisit became prime minister in December 2008.   Thaksin is playing a visible role in encouraging the current round of demonstrations against the government and is evidently positioning himself as the only person who can bring the redshirt movement off the streets.  (Here is an article by Michael K. Connors that provides much of the recent background.  Michael Connors' blog, Sovereign Myth, will be interesting to follow as well.)In other words, Thailand has been undergoing a period of intense social unrest for several years, with major contentious organizations at work to further their programs and mobilize followers, and with occasional outbursts of major urban demonstrations and riots.  And the relations among the most powerful groups in Thai society seem to be up for grabs: the military, the business elites, the middle class, the urban poor, and the rural poor.  Each segment wants something; and increasingly it seems that their demands find expression in mass mobilizations in the streets of Bangkok.These events are interesting from several points of view.  One is the simple fact that a relatively small group of demonstrators was able to bypass Thailand's security forces in their security deployment for a major international summit.  This seems roughly as shocking as if demonstrators had succeeded in penetrating the meeting rooms of the G20 in the Excel Centre in London.  News reports suggest that the police and army units offered no resistance to the protesters in their assault on the resort hotel.  This seems to imply that the government has uncertain control of the police and security forces -- an impression reinforced by demonstrations taking place today in Bangkok in which demonstrators have succeeded in seizing police vehicles and weapons.It is also interesting to consider what must be occurring beneath the surface in order to support the mobilization and coordinated actions of large groups of redshirt demonstrators in Pattaya and Bangkok.  What are the forms of organization, leadership, and communication that support this extensive level of mobilization?  What kinds of networks have been established to permit quick and effective mobilization?  How are radio and television, cell phones, text messages, and twitter feeds being used to rally supporters?  Where does the money come from that both redshirts and yellowshirts have identified as being important inducements to participation by poor people? For that matter -- what sort of organization or mobilization took place in order to bring the blueshirts mentioned above into action in Pattaya?  (A story in The Nation suggests that this may have been the result of efforts by a government agent.)  In Bangkok \"red\" radio stations appear to be broadcasting calls to action by supporters of the DAAD.  FM 92.75 and FM 107.5 are mentioned in a current story in The Nation.As for leadership -- one leader of the redshirts in Pattaya is mentioned in several news reports, Arisman Pongruengrong.  If you google his name today, you'll find he was arrested within the past twelve hours (post, post).  Here's a photo of Arisman in Pattaya on Saturday:Another dimension of interest is a \"new media\" point: it is possible to get a fair amount of real-time information about the demonstration and public attitudes by following relevant keywords on Twitter.  If you search for #redshirt on Twitter, you'll get a steady stream of comments and events (search.twitter.com).  (There are other utilities that permit easy Twitter searches as well -- for example, tweetvisor.)  And it seems possible to put together a spatial and temporal picture of the events based on references to specific streets and intersections. With enough patience it would be possible to annotate the Google map clipped above with specific events mentioned in the twitter feeds: taxis blocking this street, APC seized on that street, etc.  Here's a start of a map of Bangkok indicating the locations of Government House and a major protest blockade on Din Daeng Road.Contentious politics is an enormously interesting and productive component of contemporary social science.  The evolving situation of contention in Thailand seems tailor-made for a detailed analysis by researchers within this tradition.  I'd love to see a research paper that extends McAdam-Tarrow-Tilly's Dynamics of Contention by providing a detailed \"tagging\" of the development of these protests in terms of the chief social mechanisms of mobilization and contention that these authors highlight -- escalation, brokerage, identity shift, radicalization, convergence, and framing, for example.  And unlike the unfolding of the Solidarity Movement in Poland in the 1980s, Thailand's current contention can be investigated pretty deeply just using the tools available on the desktop: Google, Twitter, Blogger, Facebook, and access to virtually every newspaper worldwide.MTT make an important point throughout their treatments of periods of contention: the deeply contingent nature of social contention.  We can explain many of the component processes of an uprising.  But we can't discover \"laws\" of uprisings that would permit confident predictions of outcomes.  And this point about contingency seems especially compelling today: even knowing the basic intentions and resources available to the various parties in Thailand today, it is impossible to predict with confidence what the next few weeks will bring.  Will the government decide to use the coercion option?  Will this succeed -- will security forces obey orders to use force against civilians?  Will the exercise of force provoke even more powerful expressions of unrest?  And if the government decides to continue its current policy of restraint -- will the current redshirt movement simply gather more and more steam, will it take over important government buildings and television stations, will it be in a position to forcibly bring about a change of government and the return to power of   Thaksin?  Or will even more surprising turns of events emerge, outside this range of more-or-less foreseeable contingencies?"}, {"title": "Darnton's history", "date": "Thursday, April 9, 2009", "text": "Twenty-five years ago, Robert Darnton offered a highly original perspective on historical understanding in his The Great Cat Massacre: And Other Episodes in French Cultural History (1984), and the book still warrants close attention.  He proposes to bring an ethnographic perspective to bear on historical research, attempting to arrive at nuanced interpretation of the mentalities and worldviews of ordinary folk in early modern France.  (Significantly, Darnton collaborated with Clifford Geertz at Princeton, and the influences seem to have run in both directions.)  Darnton attempts to tease out some of the distinguishing elements of French rural and urban culture\u2014through folklore, through documented collective behavior, or through obscure documents authored by police inspectors and bourgeois observers.  He is \u201crealist\u201d about mentalit\u00e9s; and he recognizes as well the plasticity and variability of mentalit\u00e9s over time, space, and group.  (\u201cI do not believe there is such a thing as a typical peasant or a representative bourgeois\u201d (Darnton 1984 : 6).)  And he is more interested in the singular revealing incident than in the large structural narrative of change; he demonstrates that careful historical interpretation of a single puzzling event can result in greater illumination about a historical period than from more sweeping descriptions and narratives.Darnton does not accept the notion that \u201cgood\u201d social history must be quantitative or highly \u201cobjective\u201d\u2014that is, neutral with respect to perspective.  Rather, he sees the task of a cultural social historian as one of uncovering the threads of voice and action that permit us to reconstruct some dimensions of \u201cFrench peasant worldview\u201d and to see how startlingly different that worldview is from the modern view.  Our distance from the French peasant is great\u2014conceptually as well as materially.  So the challenges of uncovering these features of agency and mentality based on very limited historical data are great.In the title essay of the volume Darnton goes into a single incident in detail: the autobiographical account of Nicolas Contat, a printer\u2019s apprentice (later journeyman), in which Contat describes an episode of cat killing by the apprentices and journeymen in the shop.  Darnton relates the incident to its cultural and social context\u2014the symbolic role that cats had in festivals in the countryside, contemporary attitudes towards violence to animals, the sexual innuendo represented by killing the mistress\u2019s cat, the changing material relations between master and worker in the 18th century trades.   Darnton offers a \u201cthick description\u201d of this incident, allowing the reader to come to a relatively full interpretation of the significance of the various elements of the story.  At the same time, he sheds light on the background mentalit\u00e9 and social practices of workers and masters.  So the essay is a paradigm of interpretative cultural history.  Darnton describes his work in these terms:It might simply be called cultural history; for it treats our own civilization in the same way that anthropologists study alien cultures.  It is history in the ethnographic grain. \u2026 This book investigates ways of thinking in eighteenth-century France.  It attempts to show not merely what people thought but how they thought\u2014how they construed the world, invested it with meaning, and infused it with emotion. (Darnton 1984 : 3)  Darnton implicitly considers whether this incident should be considered an instance of class resistance\u2014that is, whether we can see the germs of class struggle in this complex moment. And his general perspective is that such a reading would be reductionist and anachronistic. There is resistance in this incident; there is sharp hostility between shop workers and the master and his family; but the resistance and the resentment are thematized around more specific grievances and patterns than the class struggle story would suggest. (It may be that we could better relate Darnton\u2019s reading of the incident to Scott\u2019s \u201ceveryday forms of peasant resistance,\u201d emphasizing as it does the role of humor and undetectable violence; see an earlier post on this subject.) The workers\u2019 conduct in this incident is not aimed at overthrowing the master, but at imposing an episode of pain and celebrating a moment of riot.The notion of reading runs through all the chapters, for Darnton suggests that one can read a ritual or a city just as one can read a folktale or a philosophic text.  \"The modes of exegisis may vary, but in each case one reads for meaning\u2014the meaning inscribed by contemporaries in whatever survives of their vision of the world\" (Darnton 1984 : 5).The analysis of folk tales is just as rewarding.  Darnton offers a content analysis of the folk tales collected by several generations of folklorists.  He disputes the psychological interpretations offered by Fromm, Bettelheim, and others\u2014most convincingly on the grounds that they fail to pay close enough attention to the narrative content and known historical context of the stories.  Instead, Darnton offers an interpretation of the world and worldview of the peasant storytellers who invented and repeated these tales: the omnipresence of hunger, the hazards of life on the road, the burden of children in poor households, \u2026  He shows that there is great consistency in the narratives of these stories over many generations\u2014and also there are national differences across German, French, and English versions of the stories.Darnton\u2019s work in this book is valuable for the philosophy of history in several ways.First, it exemplifies a different model of historical knowledge: not a series of events, not a cliometric analysis of society and class, but an interpretation of moments and mentalit\u00e9s in a fashion designed to shed light on the larger historical moment.  It is an effort to make historical understanding \u201cethnographic.\u201dSecond, it possesses its own form of rigor and objectivity.  The facts matter to the interpretations that Darnton offers\u2014the facts of the multiple versions of folk stories, the facts of what we know about the changing circumstances in the printing trades, the facts of peasant hunger at several periods in the 17th and 18th centuries.Third, it has the potential for shedding deeper light on French popular action than we are likely to gain from a traditional \u201crational actor\u201d or class-conflict approaches.  The motives that Darnton discerns among the printers are sometimes goal-directed; but sometimes emotional, and sometimes related to the simple recklessness of young men in constraining circumstances.Finally, Darnton's work here provides some specific insights into questions about the historical study of \u201cmentalit\u00e9s\u201d (post).  Darnton shows that it is possible to make significant headway in the project of figuring out how distant and illiterate people thought about the world around them, the social relations in which they found themselves, the natural world, and much else.  The documents available to us in the archives have a richness that speaks to these ways of thinking the world; it is therefore a valuable task for the historian to engage in piecing together the details of daily life and experience that the documents reveal and conceal.(See an earlier post for a different aspect of Darnton's historiography -- an analysis of the reviews he has written over twenty-five years in the New York Review of Books.)"}, {"title": "French sociology as a distinctive tradition", "date": "Tuesday, April 7, 2009", "text": "One might think that the globalization of intellectual life has led to the result of the \"unification\" of major scientific disciplines around one shared set of global assumptions about the discipline: what the major unsolved problems are, what the discipline should strive to achieve, what the products of knowledge ought to look like.  From the outside, anyway, one imagines that there is just one \"world physics,\" governed by roughly the same assumptions whether practiced in Berne, Chicago, London, Berlin, or Delhi.  (I would find it very interesting to be corrected on this assumption, if any readers can support the idea that there are important differences in national traditions when it comes to high-energy physics or molecular biology.)In the social sciences, though, this assumption of convergence and unification seems to be incorrect.  Instead, it seems to be the case that there are durable national traditions in sociology, political science, and anthropology that are distinct in different national settings; and further, it seems that the fairly extensive amount of cross-fertilization that occurs through international conferences and publications hasn't in fact significantly undermined the durability of these distinct traditions.A fairly obvious version of this observation arises when we contrast the ways that economic theory is pursued in the United States and India.  American economists by and large take the methodological position of neoclassical assumptions about individual behavior, general equilibrium assumptions about systemic behavior, and the assumption of \"mathematicization\" as a model for how knowledge results ought to be formulated.  (Examples might include Kenneth Arrow and Gerard Debreu in the 1950s, and currently Greg Mankiw.)   Indian economists, by contrast, seem as a group to be more interested in the human and social content of economic behavior and systems -- the effects that economic processes have on quality of life, the ways in which income and nutrition are related, and more generally, the social relations that correspond to the abstract equations of economic theory.   (I'm thinking of scholars such as Partha Dasgupta (An Inquiry into Well-Being and Destitution) or Amartya Sen (Poverty and Famines: An Essay on Entitlement and Deprivation) as exemplars of the latter perspective; here is Sen's biographical essay on the occasion of his receipt of the Nobel Prize.)That's economics; similar observations might be made about political science and anthropology.  Here I'd like to sketch out a fairly specific hypothesis: that French sociology forms a substantially distinct tradition of social thinking in the twentieth century, and that this tradition has remained largely intact in spite of the substantial amount of Franco-American interaction that has occurred in the social sciences and humanities.  I don't mean to suggest that there are no important themes of convergence, shared issues, and some cross-fertilization between French and American sociology.  But I am suggesting that French sociology has developed through French academic institutions and traditions since the 1920s; that departments and research institutes have maintained a degree of continuity in the topics and methods in use; and that these followed a path of development that was significantly different in timing, topics, and methods from the development of American sociology during the same time period.  And in fact, when we look at some important recent works of French sociology, such as Didier Lapeyronnie's Ghetto urbain or Stephane Beaud's La France invisible, we get a distinct impression of researchers who have cultivated significantly different assumptions about the nature of sociology.  Can we get more specific about this impression?Making this sort of comparison requires that we compare the recent histories of the two traditions of sociological resesearch and theory.  There are a couple of sources that provide some key signposts for the development of American sociology in the twentieth century.  I particularly like two of Andrew Abbott's books: Chaos of Disciplines and Department and Discipline: Chicago Sociology at One Hundred, a history of the Chicago school.  (Martin Bulmer's The Chicago School of Sociology is another good source on the history of the Chicago school.)   Another important and valuable contribution on the history of American sociology is Craig Calhoun's edited book, Sociology in America: A History.   I think these books give a pretty good mid-level understanding of the intellectual and institutional steps through which American sociology developed over roughly a 75-year period.For the French side, there are several recent books that can serve as a mid-level guide to the development of sociology as a social science in France.  One is by C\u00e9line B\u00e9raud and Baptiste Coulmont (Les courants contemporains de la sociologie [Contemporary Currents in Sociology]).  The other is by Philippe Masson (Faire de la sociologie: Les grandes enqu\u00eates fran\u00e7aises [Doing sociology: the great French investigations]).  Both books appear to be written for a readership that doesn't exist in the United States: advanced undergraduates needing a theoretically sophisticated introduction and guide to the evolution of the discipline of French sociology.  And for my eye, both books do an admirable job of presenting the relevant sociological ideas clearly, rigorously, and with nuance.  Neither is a research monograph; but neither book descends into over-simplification.  So they serve as a good basis for getting an understanding of the geography of the evolution of the intellectual frameworks of sociology in France over the past seventy years.There are several interesting features of the narrative that the two books offer.  Most basic is periodization: they both begin with the post-war period in French sociology.  Histories of American sociology generally start with the Chicago school in the 1920s and make the intellectual connections backwards to T\u00f6nnies, Simmel, Durkheim, Darwin, and Comte.  But these books treat contemporary French sociology as finding its origin in studies of French society following World War II.   B\u00e9raud and Coulmont write, \"In 1945, at the end of the second world war, French sociology no longer existed.  It had lost its intellectual force and energy.  And the social context didn't really prepare the ground for its revitalization.  It was necessary first to reconstruct France from the destruction of war.\"  Masson makes a similar point, writing that \"sociology (with its departments, research laboratories, curricula, reviews, etc.) wasn't constituted until relatively recently, during the end of the 1950s and the decade following.\"  And, B\u00e9raud and Coulmont suggest, the pre-war tradition of Durkheim's sociology had exhausted itself; so reviving sociological research was not simply a matter of dusting off the ideas and methods of Durkheim and his followers in the 1920s and 1930s.The choice of 1945, then, is meaningful; the authors appear to suggest that French sociology took a genuinely new beginning after World War II.  B\u00e9raud and Coulmont break the story up into several major intellectual periods and meta-themes in roughly chronological order: \"renewal of French sociology\" (Marxism, labor sociology, American influence, empiricism, statistical methods); [Raymond Aron, Michel Crozier, George Gurvitch, and, transitionally, Pierre Bourdieu/Jean-Claude Passeron, Les H\u00e9ritiers]\"Thinking inequalities\" (inequality, opportunity, domination, masculinity, segregation) [Pierre Bourdieu, Raymond Boudon, Eric Maurin]; \"Action and homo sociologicus\" (habitus, strategy, situational sociology);[Fran\u00e7ois Dubet, Pierre Bourdieu, Raymond Boudon, Bernard Lahire]\"History and sociology\" (the role of comparative historical work in sociology); [Jean-Claude Passeron, Edgar Morin, Henri Mendras] \"Individual and modernity\" (individualization and the definition of modernity) [Raymond Boudon, Fran\u00e7ois Dubet, Eric Maurin]Influences and concepts from American social science come into the account in a few places -- for example, in the discussion of rationality and collective action theory (free riders, methodological individualism) and in the discussion of the influence of Goffman's sociology of interaction.  (The sociology of German-born, British-based sociologist Norbert Elias is also credited with being a substantial influence.)  But most commonly, the discourses described here, the debates and controversies that are described, are largely self-contained within the precincts of French sociological research.Philippe Masson offers a different basis for surveying pretty much the same series of developments within French sociology.  He picks out a number of important topics and researchers for detailed treatment: Georges Gurvitch, Georges Friedmann, Paul-Henri Chombart de Lauwe, Louis-Joseph Lebret, Alaine Touraine, Michel Crozier, Edgar Morin, Henri Mendras, Raymonde Moulin, Pierre Bourdieu, Jean-Claude Passeron, Luc Boltanski, Pierre Bourdieu, Fran\u00e7ois Dubet, Bruno Latour, Steve Wooglar, Jean Peneff.  Topics he highlights include urban sociology, sociology of labor, the study of inequality, the study of the professions, the influence of \"constructivism\", the study of urban youth, and the sociology of science and technology.  Masson notes the influence of American sociology at a number of points (82), including the influence of Talcott Parsons.  And he also describes a significant French interest in the American Chicago school of sociology and the approaches of \"ethnomethodology\".  Once again, though, at least in my reading, it seems to me that the narrative that Philippe Masson provides is one that captures a fairly autonomous national tradition of sociological thinking -- with occasional but limited influences from developments in sociology in the United States.This is a start on the question at hand.  Both these books seem to document what might be called in the sociology of science a largely independent research tradition constituting French sociology since World War II.  (This impression of independence could probably be tested by a citation analysis.)  This tradition defined its own problems for research; debated and pursued a variety of methods of investigation; and formulated some fairly specific ideas about what a finished sociological analysis ought to look like.  And it seems to have resulted in a current sociological enterprise that differs in significant ways from current American or British sociology.What is needed next is a good analytical account of how French sociology differs from American sociology in terms of (a) the topic areas that are identified as most important for investigation, (b) the methods that are regarded as most reliable and scientifically justified (statistical, qualitative, comparative, participant-observer, ...); and (c) the assumptions that exist about what form sociological knowledge should take (deductive theories, narratives of particular social processes, statistical tables, ...)."}, {"title": "Transnational protest movements", "date": "Saturday, April 4, 2009", "text": "We've seen a fairly large increase in the occurrence of large international protest movements in the past thirty years. The anti-nuclear movement of the 1980s drew a substantial following across Europe and to some extent North America. (Historian E. P. Thompson played a significant leadership role in the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament; see for example PROTEST AND SURVIVE.) Anti-globalization protests in Seattle, Washington, and Davos drew substantial support from international organizations and participants. Major anti-war protests occurred in numerous European cities after the onset of the US-led war on Iraq. And now protests in London against the G20 meeting and in Strasbourg against NATO have drawn supporters and groups around Europe (post).  (Here is a current account of the Strasbourg protests in the Dernieres nouvelles d'Alsace.)These movements are riveting in a number of ways, from the point of view of sociology and international politics.  We can ask questions at every edge of the phenomena:Power and influence.  How effective are mass demonstrations at achieving their declared goals?  Do mass demonstrations influence government and multinational policies in the direction intended by the organizers and followers?    For that matter -- how much of an influence can a large demonstration in Rome have on a subsequent effort to mobilize over a similar issue in New York?  What is the role of mass media in the timing, pace, and public impact of large demonstrations?Mobilization. What processes of mobilization and organization are at work in these specific periods of mass mobilization?  To what extent do modern transnational protests embody a significant degree of common purpose and political identity?  (Here's a recent post on the difficulty of defining a group mentality.)  What organizations have the most influence in determining the strategy and tactics of the mass political actions that are called for?  What networks of leaders and counter-politicians can be discerned in the period of mobilization leading up to the mass event?  What is the nature of the networks that exist within the various communities of interest -- environmentalists, anti-war activists, anti-globalization activists?  What sorts of issues have proven most potent in mobilizing significant numbers of adherents and organizations from different countries?  What motivates followers to heed the call and bring themselves to London or Strasbourg? What is the combination of commitment, identity, and adventure that results in involvement?Internal politics.  What factors internal to a movement -- whether environmentalist, anti-globalization, anti-war, anti-nuclear -- lead to cohesion and dissension within the movement?  What factors lead to the occasional outbreaks of violence between protesters and police?  (See an earlier post on this question.)   Is violence a deliberate tactic on either side -- militants or forces of order?  What role do organizations such as anarchist groups and other radical, rejectionist groups play within the broader movement?  Is it possible for small groups of rejectionists to \"hijack\" the large demonstration for their own purposes?These questions overlap several distinct areas of research: resource mobilization theory, social movements, international relations theory, and comparative politics.  (This is a point that McAdam, Tilly, and Tarrow make in Dynamics of Contention: there is much to be gained by studying these contentious movements across the traditional areas of study.) And the questions are probably further complicated by the availability of internet-based forms of communication and mobilization.Sidney Tarrow has turned his attention to international protest movements as a particularly interesting form of \"contentious politics.\"  His 2005 book, The New Transnational Activism, treats international protests and their movements from the point of view of the Tilly-McAdam-Tarrow framework of theory and analysis of contentious politics. Here are a few framing assumptions from the introduction:Students of domestic movements long ago determined that collective action cannot be traced to grievances or social cleavages, even vast ones like those connected to globalization. Acting collectively requires activists to marshal resources, become aware of and seize opportunities, frame their demands in ways that enable them to join with others, and identify common targets.  If these thresholds constitute barriers in domestic politics, they are even higher when people mobilize across borders.  Globalization is not sufficient to explain when people will engage in collective action and when they will not.Nor does combating globalization automatically give rise to \"global social movements.\" For Charles Tilly, a \"social movement\" is \"a sustained, organized public effort making collective claims on target authorities\" that uses a well-hewn contentious repertoire on the part of people who proclaim themselves to be worthy, unified, numerous, and committed.For one thing, forming transnational social movements is not easy.  Sustaining collective action across borders on the part of people who seldom see one another and who lack embedded relations of trust is difficult.  For another, repertoires of contention grow out of and are lodged in local and national contexts.  Even more difficult is developing a common collective identity among people from different cultural backgrounds whose governments are not inclined to encourage them to do so.Tarrow's central hypothesis about transnational protest movements comes back to the core idea of \"opportunity structures.\" International organizations and networks have created a new set of opportunities for transgressive groups who have an interest in challenging the status quo.Tarrow identifies several important types of sources of evidence and theory for his current work: international political economy, anthropologists and students of public opinion, specific studies of international protest events, studies of transnational networks and institutions, and theorists of the idea of \"global civil society.\"  He explicitly locates the book as falling squarely within the research program established in Dynamics of Contention; his goal is to make use of this ontology of social mechanisms and processes to provide a sociology of transnational protest.What I'm eager to see is some of the concrete empirical work that this approach suggests: specific empirical studies of the networks, organizations, and dynamic processes through which major transnational protests have unfolded in the past decade or so.  It would seem that some important new tools helpful for such study are now much more readily available -- essentially, using the internet to track organizations, announcements, and efforts at mobilization.  Tarrow provides some of this research -- for example, in his summary of research on the networks and localism of participants in the \"Battle of Seattle\".  But this level of analysis seems to be where the action needs to be at this point in the study of transnational social movements.  But Tarrow is certainly right in thinking that this subject area is important, and it is one that follows very logically from the framework of analysis of social contention developed by himself, Doug McAdam, and Charles Tilly in the earlier Dynamics of Contention."}, {"title": "Primitive accumulation", "date": "Sunday, March 29, 2009", "text": "Marx's treatment of the \"so-called 'primitive accumulation'\" is one of the most historically detailed sections in Capital: A Critique of Political Economy (Volume 1).  And it is one of the most interesting parts of Capital to read as a separate piece. (Here is an electronic text of the section.)  It is Marx's account of the historical processes of change in rural life of the fifteenth through eighteenth century in Britain and Ireland, through which peasants were forced off their land and the commons were enclosed.  Marx believes that this separation of the peasantry from the land was a necessary condition for the development of capitalism, in that it created the conditions in which there was a pliable and abundant proletariat.  This \"free\" proletariat was needed for the creation of the factory system and the development of manufacturing cities.  So the process of primitive accumulation created the changes in social relations, property relations, and the accumulation of wealth that permitted the creation of the capital-labor relation and factory-based capitalism.Marx sometimes puts this point in a fairly teleological way, looking at primitive accumulation as a necessary step on the road to British capitalism. (For example, he refers to this process as \"the revolution that laid the foundation of the capitalist mode of production.\")  But it is possible, and preferable, to read Marx's analysis here less teleologically, as simply a detailed account of some of the crucial but contingent changes that took place in rural social relations during these centuries, without importing the idea that these changes were functionally related to the later development of capitalism.  And read non-teleologically, the section holds up fairly well in relation to modern historical scholarship.Marx describes the basic social relations of British rural life in the fifteenth century in these terms, as a freeholding peasantry with access to substantial common lands, pasture, and forest:The immense majority of the population consisted then, and to a still larger extent, in the 15th century, of free peasant proprietors, whatever was the feudal title under which their right of property was hidden. In the larger seignorial domains, the old bailiff, himself a serf, was displaced by the free farmer.  The wage-labourers of agriculture consisted partly of peasants, who utilised their leisure time by working on the large estates, partly of an independent special class of wage-labourers, relatively and absolutely few in numbers.  The latter also were practically at the same time peasant farmers, since, besides their wages, they had allotted to them arable land to the extent of 4 or more acres, together with their cottages. Besides they, with the rest of the peasants, enjoyed the usufruct of the common land, which gave pasture to their cattle, furnished them with timber, fire-wood, turf, &c. And he identifies the crucial turn towards expropriation of the free peasant proprietor:In insolent conflict with king and parliament, the great feudal lords created an incomparably larger proletariat by the forcible driving of the peasantry from the land, to which the latter had the same feudal right as the lord himself, and by the usurpation of the common lands. The rapid rise of the Flemish wool manufactures, and the corresponding rise in the price of wool in England, gave the direct impulse to these evictions. The old nobility had been devoured by the great feudal wars. The new nobility was the child of its time, for which money was the power of all powers. Transformation of arable land into sheep-walks was, therefore, its cry. (It is interesting to recall that Oliver Goldsmith describes the eighteenth-century version of this process in Ireland in his poem, The Deserted Village (1770):Sweet smiling village, loveliest of the lawn,Thy sports are fled, and all thy charms withdrawn;Amidst thy bowers the tyrant's hand is seen,And Desolation saddens all thy green:One only master grasps the whole domain,And half a tillage stints thy smiling plain.No more thy glassy brook reflects the day,But, choked with sedges, works its weedy way;Along thy glades, a solitary guest,The hollow-sounding bittern guards its nest;Amidst thy desert walks the lapwing flies,And tires their echoes with unvaried cries:Sunk are thy bowers in shapeless ruin all,And the long grass o'ertops the mouldering wallAnd, trembling, shrinking from the spoiler's hand,Far, far away thy children leave the land.Ill fares the land, to hastening ills a prey, Where wealth accumulates, and men decay. Princes and lords may flourish, or may fade; A breath can make them, as a breath has made: But a bold peasantry, their country's pride, When once destroy'd, can never be supplied.  )And Marx emphasizes the coercive nature of this expropriation of the yeoman peasant:Even in the last decade of the 17th century, the yeomanry, the class of independent peasants, were more numerous than the class of farmers. They had formed the backbone of Cromwell\u2019s strength, and, even according to the confession of Macaulay, stood in favourable contrast to the drunken squires and to their servants, the country clergy, who had to marry their masters\u2019 cast-off mistresses. About 1750, the yeomanry had disappeared, and so had, in the last decade of the 18th century, the last trace of the common land of the agricultural labourer. We leave on one side here the purely economic causes of the agricultural revolution.  We deal only with the forcible means employed.A crucial component of the \"primitive accumulation\", in Marx's interpretation, was the abolition of common property, culminating in the enclosure acts in the seventeenth century:Communal property \u2014 always distinct from the State property just dealt with \u2014 was an old Teutonic institution which lived on under cover of feudalism. We have seen how the forcible usurpation of this, generally accompanied by the turning of arable into pasture land, begins at the end of the 15th and extends into the 16th century. But, at that time, the process was carried on by means of individual acts of violence against which legislation, for a hundred and fifty years, fought in vain. The advance made by the 18th century shows itself in this, that the law itself becomes now the instrument of the theft of the people\u2019s land, although the large farmers make use of their little independent methods as well.  The parliamentary form of the robbery is that of Acts for enclosures of Commons, in other words, decrees by which the landlords grant themselves the people\u2019s land as private property, decrees of expropriation of the people. Sir F. M. Eden refutes his own crafty special pleading, in which he tries to represent communal property as the private property of the great landlords who have taken the place of the feudal lords, when he, himself, demands a \u201cgeneral Act of Parliament for the enclosure of Commons\u201d (admitting thereby that a parliamentary coup d\u2019\u00e9tat is necessary for its transformation into private property), and moreover calls on the legislature for the indemnification for the expropriated poor.We even are afforded a glimpse of the economist's view of the rationality of enclosure.  According to John Arbuthnot, enclosure and the creation of private farms is a more productive use of land and labor:Let us hear for a moment a defender of enclosures and an opponent of Dr. Price. \u201cNot is it a consequence that there must be depopulation, because men are not seen wasting their labour in the open field.... If, by converting the little farmers into a body of men who must work for others, more labour is produced, it is an advantage which the nation\u201d (to which, of course, the \u201cconverted\u201d ones do not belong)  \u201cshould wish for ... the produce being greater when their joint labours are employed on one farm, there will be a surplus for manufactures, and by this means manufactures, one of the mines of the nation, will increase, in proportion to the quantity of corn produced.\u201dAnd here Marx describes the final stages of the \"rationalization\" of agriculture, in the expropriation of the Scots:The last process of wholesale expropriation of the agricultural population from the soil is, finally, the so-called clearing of estates, i.e., the sweeping men off them. All the English methods hitherto considered culminated in \u201cclearing.\u201d As we saw in the picture of modern conditions given in a former chapter, where there are no more independent peasants to get rid of, the \u201cclearing\u201d of cottages begins; so that the agricultural labourers do not find on the soil cultivated by them even the spot necessary for their own housing. But what \u201cclearing of estates\u201d really and properly signifies, we learn only in the promised land of modern romance, the Highlands of Scotland. There the process is distinguished by its systematic character, by the magnitude of the scale on which it is carried out at one blow (in Ireland landlords have gone to the length of sweeping away several villages at once; in Scotland areas as large as German principalities are dealt with), finally by the peculiar form of property, under which the embezzled lands were held. Eventually we come to the point where industrial capitalism is feasible and there is a \"free\" proletariat available for labor:It is not enough that the conditions of labour are concentrated in a mass, in the shape of capital, at the one pole of society, while at the other are grouped masses of men, who have nothing to sell but their labour-power. Neither is it enough that they are compelled to sell it voluntarily. The advance of capitalist production develops a working-class, which by education, tradition, habit, looks upon the conditions of that mode of production as self-evident laws of Nature. The organisation of the capitalist process of production, once fully developed, breaks down all resistance. And, of course, Engels picks up the story from the perspective of nineteenth-century Manchester and Birmingham, and the conditions of squalor and oppressive factory labor that resulted.  (See an earlier posting on Engels's sociology of the proletarian city.)The English Marxist historians have devoted a lot of their attention to this period of British social history.  (Harvey Kaye gives a very good account of the work of this generation of Marxist historians in The British Marxist Historians.)   Maurice Dobb is one of the English socialist historians who has retraced Marx's steps on this subject in some detail.  One of Dobb's important books, Studies In The Development Of Capitalism (1963), treats this process of the decline of the English peasantry and the rise of the proletariat, making use of the historical scholarship of the first part of the twentieth century.  Some of Rodney Hilton's research on this period can be found in Class Conflict and the Crisis of Feudalism: Essays in Medieval Social History (Rev).  Several generations later, Robert Brenner gave a somewhat different interpretation of the history of agrarian change in England from the sixteenth to the eighteenth centuries; his views were developed in the splendid journal Past & Present and were separately published along with a round of critical reactions in The Brenner Debate: Agrarian Class Structure and Economic Development in Pre-industrial Europe."}, {"title": "Hobbes an institutionalist?", "date": "Friday, March 27, 2009", "text": "Here is a surprising idea: of all the modern political philosophers, Thomas Hobbes comes closest to sharing the logic and worldview of modern social science.  In Leviathan (1651) he sets out the problem of understanding the social world in terms that resemble a modern institutionalist and rational-choice approach to social explanation.  It is a constructive approach, proceeding from reasoning about the constituents of society, to aggregative conclusions about the wholes that are constituted by these individuals.  He puts forward a theory of agency -- how individuals reason and what their most basic motives are.  Individuals are rational and self-concerned; they are strategic, in that they anticipate the likely behaviors of other agents; and they are risk-averse, in that they take steps to avoid attack by other agents.  And he puts forward a description of two institutional settings within which social action takes place: the state of nature, where no \"overawing\" political institutions exist; and the sovereign state, where a single sovereign power imposes a set of laws regulating individuals' actions.In the first institutional setting, he argues that individual competition in the context of the absence of sovereignty leads to perpetual violent competition.  In the second institutional setting, he argues that individual self-striving within the context of a system of law leads to the accumulation of property and peaceful coexistence.Here are some of Hobbes's premises about individual agents from chapter XIII of Leviathan:From this equality of ability ariseth equality of hope in the attaining of our ends. And therefore if any two men desire the same thing, which nevertheless they cannot both enjoy, they become enemies; and in the way to their end (which is principally their own conservation, and sometimes their delectation only) endeavour to destroy or subdue one another. And from hence it comes to pass that where an invader hath no more to fear than another man's single power, if one plant, sow, build, or possess a convenient seat, others may probably be expected to come prepared with forces united to dispossess and deprive him, not only of the fruit of his labour, but also of his life or liberty. And the invader again is in the like danger of another.So that in the nature of man, we find three principal causes of quarrel. First, competition; secondly, diffidence; thirdly, glory.  The first maketh men invade for gain; the second, for safety; and the third, for reputation. The first use violence, to make themselves masters of other men's persons, wives, children, and cattle; the second, to defend them; the third, for trifles, as a word, a smile, a different opinion, and any other sign of undervalue, either direct in their persons or by reflection in their kindred, their friends, their nation, their profession, or their name.The passions that incline men to peace are: fear of death; desire of such things as are necessary to commodious living; and a hope by their industry to obtain them. And reason suggesteth convenient articles of peace upon which men may be drawn to agreement. These articles are they which otherwise are called the laws of nature, whereof I shall speak more particularly in the two following chapters.And these motives and forms of behavior by individuals lead to a predictable outcome for the collectivity in the state of nature: a war of all against all.Whatsoever therefore is consequent to a time of war, where every man is enemy to every man, the same consequent to the time wherein men live without other security than what their own strength and their own invention shall furnish them withal. In such condition there is no place for industry, because the fruit thereof is uncertain: and consequently no culture of the earth; no navigation, nor use of the commodities that may be imported by sea; no commodious building; no instruments of moving and removing such things as require much force; no knowledge of the face of the earth; no account of time; no arts; no letters; no society; and which is worst of all, continual fear, and danger of violent death; and the life of man, solitary, poor, nasty, brutish, and short.This is an institutionalist argument.  It models the behavior that is expected of a certain kind of agent within a certain kind of institutional setting; and it projects the consequences of these \"microfoundations\" for the aggregate society.  In other words, Hobbes is offering a micro- to macro-argument based on analysis of modes of agency and assumptions about a particular institutional context.Compare this logic with a description of the logic of social explanation offered by contemporary rational-choice social theorist James Coleman in Foundations of Social Theory:A second mode of explanation of the behavior of social systems entails examining processes internal to the system, involving its component parts, or units at a level below that of the system.  The prototypical case is that in which the component parts are individuals who are members of the social system.  In other cases the component parts may be institutions within the system or subgroups that are part of the system.  In all cases the analysis can be seen as moving to a lower level than that of the system, explaining the behavior of the system by recourse to the behavior of its parts.  This mode of explanation is not uniquely quantitative or uniquely qualitative, but may be either. (2)So the logic of Hobbes's argument is fairly clear; and it is deeply similar to that of institutionalist rational-choice theorists. Thomas Schelling's title, Micromotives and Macrobehavior, captures the idea in three words: derive descriptions of macro-level social arrangements and behavior from premises concerning individual-level motivation and action.It is not a profound criticism of Hobbes's philosophical analysis to quarrel with Hobbes's specific assumptions about what is possible within the state of nature.  And in fact, a number of contemporary political scientists argue that it is possible for men and women to create non-political institutions within the context of what Hobbes calls the state of nature. Coordination and cooperation are indeed possible within a \"state of nature\"; it is possible to achieve coordination within anarchy. From a sociological point of view, this is really a friendly amendment; it simply adds a further premise about the feasibility of certain kinds of cooperation.  So the \"cooperation within anarchy\" criticism of Hobbes is advanced as a substantive argument about the feasibility of durable social institutions that do not depend upon a central coercive authority. And it depends upon several specific assumptions about the circumstances and mechanisms through which local groups of people can establish self-enforcing forms of cooperation that overcome free-riders and predatorial behavior.  It is likely enough that Hobbes would not have been persuaded by this argument; but ultimately it is an empirical question.Several arguments against Hobbes's conclusions about the state of nature are especially valuable from this point of view.  First, I find Michael Taylor's arguments in Community, Anarchy and Liberty particularly convincing -- essentially, that peasant communities have traditionally found ways of creating and sustaining cooperative institutions and relationships that persist without the force of law to stabilize them.  \"Contracts\" backed by legal systems are not the only way of establishing coordination and cooperation among independent agents.  Robert Netting provides relevant examples in Smallholders, Householders: Farm Families and the Ecology of Intensive, Sustainable Agriculture, around traditional forms of labor-sharing and seasonal cooperation.    And Elinor Ostrom and her collaborators make similar arguments in their historical and sociological studies of \"common property resource regimes\" -- essentially, stable patterns of cooperation maintained by local voluntary enforcement rather than central legislation (Governing the Commons: The Evolution of Institutions for Collective Action).   Ostrom documents dozens of important historical cases where traditional communities have managed fisheries, forests, water resources, and other common properties without having a central state to support these patterns of cooperation and coordination.But these are empirical and theoretical refinements to a fundamentally coherent model of social explanation that is full-fledged in Hobbes's work in the mid-seventeenth century: explain aggregate (macro) social outcomes as the result of mechanisms and actions at the level of individual actors."}, {"title": "Philosophical frameworks in the social sciences", "date": "Wednesday, March 25, 2009", "text": "It is fairly evident that there were substantive ontological assumptions about how the social world worked that guided the founders of sociology: individuals create social outcomes (Mill), norms and values have a superordinate role in social action (Durkheim), the problem of social order is the fundamental problem for sociology (Durkheim), crises are common within capitalism (Marx), social events are meaningful and historically particular (Dilthey), modern society is marked by impersonal social institutions (T\u00f6nnies) .... Assumptions at this level guided the thinking of specific theorists as they developed conceptual schemes in terms of which to understand the social world and advanced theories about how the social world worked.We should therefore not imagine that the social sciences developed as an abstract, logical solution to a simple problem, as perhaps naive empiricism might have suggested: identify the domain of social phenomena that constitute the declared subject matter of a given discipline of social science; examine and classify the phenomena so as to discover whatever regularities are to be found among them; formulate theoretical hypotheses about the laws that govern these phenomena; and explain the patterns and events that are discovered as the consequences of these hypothetical laws. Instead, each of the founders of the social sciences came to his or her studies with fairly specific pre-scientific ideas about what the domain of the social world was and how it should be explained. These ideas are both ontological and methodological; and all of them are contestable. Perhaps we might describe this framework as a \u201cfolk philosophy of knowledge\u201d that is to some extent unexamined but that guides the pursuit of knowledge, the form that it takes, and the ways in which it is evaluated.German intellectual historian Fritz Ringer tries to locate Max Weber's intellectual origins within what he calls an \"intellectual field\" -- as he puts it, \"a constellation of positions that are meaningful only in relation to one another, a constellation further characterized by differences of power or authority, by the opposition between orthodoxy and heterodoxy, and by the role of the cultural preconscious, of tacit 'doxa' that are transmitted by inherited practices, institutions, and social relations\"; Max Weber's Methodology: The Unification of the Cultural and Social Sciences, p. 5. I think that Ringer is raising a question quite similar to mine here: what are the substantive reference points and conceptual presuppositions that the theorist brings to his theory and inquiry as he sets out. And this question is particularly crucial at the beginning; later theorists are in turn formed by their readings and reactions to the theories and systems of the prior generation.Naturalism and positivism  -- the idea that the social sciences ought to resemble the natural sciences, and the idea that the goal of science is the discovery of empirically supported lawlike generalizations -- constituted a powerful folk philosophy of science that was shared by Durkheim, Mill, and Comte. Given the power of the natural sciences in the nineteenth century, naturalism is unsurprising\u2014even though it is profoundly misleading when applied to the social world. (See an earlier posting on non-naturalistic models of social science for more on the shortcomings of naturalism as a framework for social inquiry.)But naturalism and positivism were not the only substantive philosophical frameworks that influenced the first generation of the social sciences. The hermeneutic tradition was a strikingly different starting point for the rigorous investigation and explanation of social realities. The hermeneutic tradition derived from literary and biblical interpretation; it looked at history and human affairs as a body of meaningful signs that required interpretation. And it emphasized the singular over the general, the historically particular over the law-like generalization. Dilthey's hermeneutic philosophy offered a non-positivist, non-causalist starting point for the \"human sciences\". The intellectual tradition that Dilthey absorbed and re-deployed as a basis for the human sciences was philosophically rigorous and committed to careful argumentation and interpretation. But it differed profoundly from the epistemology of empiricism and positivism.The key point here should not be lost. It is that the various efforts to forge a scientific theory of society are partly empirical and theoretical; but they are also partly metaphysical and epistemic, grounded in pre-scientific assumptions about the nature of the social world and the nature of empirical study of society that are only partially expressed and are inherently debatable. Metaphors, pictures, hunches, and the thinker's own experiences play a deeply important role in the development of sociological frameworks. This is why it is appropriate to refer to the \"sociological imagination.\"  There are other starting points; and if we had started with different philosophical frameworks and different metaphors, we would have arrived at different sociologies. So engaging with the philosophy of social science is a fruitful way of trying to rethink the presuppositions of existing approaches to a \"science of society\".A prior posting on philosophy and the social sciences addresses this issue as well.  Here is a posting on the roots of the philosophy of social science and a posting on continental philosophy of social science that are relevant as well."}, {"title": "Social control of crowds", "date": "Tuesday, March 24, 2009", "text": "There is a pretty high level of social protest taking place in France today.  Strikes and demonstrations are taking place in many cities, involving students, faculty, workers, and other ordinary people.  (Here is a recent news roundup dated March 19, 2009, on strikes, demonstrations, and manifs in the past month or so, and here is a BBC report on a round of large strikes in January.)  The demands largely have to do with the current economic crisis, unemployment, changes in the social security system, and proposed reforms to higher education.  French people are demanding specific changes from the government, and the government does not seem to want to compromise.These collective actions carry out a tradition of public protest in French political culture that goes back at least a century and a half (Charles Tilly, The Contentious French).  And few politicians in France will have overlooked the fact that public protests have sometimes developed into even more confrontational forms of collective action and conflict -- in 1968, for example, and in the banlieue in 2005.  So the current round of protests and mass demonstrations has a significance in French political history that raises the possibility of even more intense civil conflict in the next twelve months.What is to prevent the possibility that large organized demonstrations and strikes may develop into more violent conflicts between the population and the state in the future?  How can the state ensure that large-scale peaceful protest -- a basic democratic right -- doesn't turn into episodic rioting and civil unrest when political stalemate emerges or when economic and social conditions worsen?The question is a pressing one, because very large demonstrations and protests are volatile and unpredictable.  When there are tens of thousands of participants and a range of leading organizations in a large demonstration, it is possible for the actions of the crowd to develop in ways that were not intended or anticipated.  A peaceful march down a central boulevard can proceed from beginning to end with a great deal of internal discipline, with organizations maintaining ranks and preserving order.  Many of the photos of manifs in French cities are distinguished by the prominent signs and banners the protesters carry announcing the organizations they represent -- labor unions, student organizations, faculty groups.  And these banners themselves are an indication of organization and discipline.  So large, peaceful protests can be organized and carried out successfully.But the same march can also degenerate into skirmishing and street fighting involving small groups of activists and police.  A small splinter group of violent protesters may break away from the march to engage in acts of violence against property -- burning cars, smashing shop windows.  And these acts may spread by contagion to other parts of the crowd.  Or a group of activists may deliberately confront the police with stones or bottles, with the goal of provoking violent reaction and an escalation of conflict.  (This appears to have happened repeatedly in Athens a few months ago, and it was an anarchist tactic in the anti-globalization protests that took place in many cities a few years ago.)  Or a group of police may engage in a demonstration of power intended to intimidate the crowd, leading to police violence against members of the crowd; again, this violence may spread to other locations.  Even an unfortunate accident can lead to an outburst of violence -- a frightened driver losing control of his car and injuring a group of demonstrators, for example, can lead to panic and escalation.  And any of these small outbreaks of violence can spread through the larger crowd, leading to an uncontrollable spasm of action and reaction.So how can the authorities in a democracy develop strategies for ensuring that peaceful protests avoid violent escalation?  I suppose the most direct strategy is to consider the demands themselves and evaluate whether they legitimately call for changes of policy that ought to be enacted.  Compromise over the central issues leading to mass protest presumably has some effect on the likelihood of violence and disorder.  If the people are convinced that the government is acting unjustly, the government ought to at least consider whether there is some legitimacy in these complaints.A second strategy is more tactical.  Recognizing that protest is likely to occur, it makes sense for the authorities to work with the organizers and their organizations to arrive at agreements about the scope and nature of the protest.  The route, location, duration, and other conditions of the protest can be negotiated.  And the authorities are well advised to attempt to gain the support of the organizers in an agreement to maintain internal discipline within the demonstration -- to win the agreement of the organizations themselves to attempt to suppress possible outbursts of violence by minority elements within the crowd.A third strategy involves, of course, policing.  The authorities have both the ability and the obligation to use police powers to ensure public order.  And this means that they need to plan intelligently for the disposition and behavior of police forces to contain possible violent outbursts.  But the use of police force is a delicate political art.  Heavy-handed, intimidating policing seems to be as likely to provoke violence as to suppress it.  Police behavior that depends upon the conspicuous threat of force likewise is likely to be provocative -- a double line of police with truncheons and riot gear, with face shields providing a disturbing anonymity, is likely to provoke fear and aggression in the crowd that it confronts.  And, of course, police behavior that crosses the line to overt acts of brutality is almost certain to provoke violent response, as news of police violence spreads through the crowd.  But it is also possible to err on the side of insufficient police presence; forces that can be quickly overwhelmed create the situation of a sudden escalation of violence by a crowd that has suddenly realized that there is no barrier to further violent actions.It would seem that the ideal prescription for a policing strategy is something like this: enough police force in the vicinity to respond quickly and decisively to acts of violence by members of the crowd; positioning of police forces in fairly inconspicuous locations so their presence is not itself a provocation; and well-trained police forces who can be trusted to refrain from unnecessary violence against protesters.  (The \"police riot\" in Chicago in 1968 plainly led to rapid escalation of violence in that situation.)What makes this question so complicated is the fact that it involves social actions, conflicts, and relationships at many levels: the basic conflict between organized groups with explicit demands and the state with its interest in enforcing its policies; the limited degree of control that protest organizers have over the behavior of followers; the fact that smaller groups and organizations within the protest movement may have goals that are more radical than those of the main organizations; the fact that the authorities have only limited control over the forces at their command; and the fact that there may not be acceptable compromises that successfully resolve the conflict between protesters and the state.  These factors make the behavior of the crowd somewhat unpredictable, and they introduce major sources of contingency into the way in which a particular day of protest and season of dissent play out.Bringing the discussion back to France in 2009, there seem to be several large possibilities for the coming year.  The government may decide that it needs to adjust some of its policies in order to reduce the level of popular dissent and unrest; it needs to reach a social compromise.  The government may hold firm but the dissenting organizations may grow fatigued or discouraged -- so that the current round of protest and strikes subsides.  Both sides may hold firm but an equilibrium level of protest and response may be reached, with neither side escalating to a higher level of civil conflict and violence.  Or, finally, both the government and the protest movement may hold firm and protests may spiral upward into greater levels of social conflict, with riots and violent protests ensuing. More and more force may be exerted through police repression, and this may lead to more widespread and more aggressive demonstrations in the following weeks.  And, of course, all of these scenarios are likely to have consequences for electoral outcomes in the coming several years."}, {"title": "Acting as a group", "date": "Sunday, March 22, 2009", "text": "What is involved in acting as a group? What is the difference between a crowd of pedestrians crossing Mass Ave in Cambridge when the light changes and a group of students marching into Harvard Hall in an attempt to initiate a protest? How about the difference between a group of history graduate students pursuing research simultaneously but separately on early New England diseases in Widener Library, and a research group of scientists collaborating to discover the mechanism of HIV transmission at the cellular level?The intuitive answer to these questions is pretty clear. A group activity requires some level of collective intentions and purposes on the parts of the participants towards each other and towards the group itself. A group is more than an ensemble of individuals performing a similar set of actions (pedestrians, independent researchers). Rather, we want to see some indication that the individuals regard themselves as members of the group; that they embrace some conception of the action that members of the group propose to perform; and that they individually choose their plans of action out of consideration of this group or collective purpose. In a group's actions, the individuals who make up the group are oriented towards the group and its goals and purposes.  In other words, groups are constituted by some form of group-oriented intentionality on the part of individual members, and group actions are performed by individuals who have adopted a set of beliefs and attitudes towards other members of the group and its collective purposes.There are quite a few complications that arise here, however. Here is one: many collective activities involve participants with a wide range of affiliation with the collective purpose. There are core members who explicitly and emphatically declare adherence to the collective goal and plan. There are some who are willing followers without a clear idea of the purpose or plan. There are opportunistic joiners who have their own private reasons for joining the group project. And there may even be a degree of disagreement within the group about goals, strategies, and tactics -- with the result that many committed members nonetheless differ from each other with respect to their collective intentions. And these aren't sharp distinctions in most cases -- so a given collectivity may consist of a deeply mixed group of individuals with respect to their understandings, purposes, and affinities for the collective action.Several philosophers have focused on this set of problems surrounding \"group intentions\". Margaret Gilbert thinks there is a sharp distinction between group intentions and individual intentions (On Social Facts).  More recently, Raimo Tuomela refers to \"we\" intentions and \"I\" intentions in order to explain the defining characteristics of group behavior in The Philosophy of Social Practices: A Collective Acceptance View. Both Gilbert and Tuomela seem to think that groups have intentions that are autonomous from the purposes and intentions of members of the group -- a sort of Durkheimian view of the autonomous reality of the mentality of groups. What these approaches have in common is a desire to postulate a strong distinction in levels between group intentions and individual intentions.Gilbert\u2019s primary contention is that the notion of a collectivity\u2014individuals constituting a group\u2014is the central feature of social ontology.  And she maintains that this concept can best be analyzed by the idea of a \u201cplural subject\u201d\u2014the referent of the first-person plural pronoun, \u201cwe\u201d.  The core of Gilbert\u2019s theory of social groups involves the idea of the mutual recognition by a set of persons that they are engaged in some joint actions or beliefs.  \u201cA set of people constitute a social group if and only if they constitute a plural subject\u201d; and a plural subject is \u201ca set of people each of whom shares with oneself in some action, belief, attitude, or similar attribute\u201d (p. 204).  Gilbert argues that the pronouns \u201cus\u201d and \u201cwe\u201d are the linguistic elements through which we refer to plural subjects in English.  And she believes that plural subjects exist; they are not fictions or constructions, but agents which have beliefs, perform actions, and succeed or fail in carrying out their intentions.    According to Gilbert, \u201csocial groups are plural subjects, collective beliefs are the beliefs of plural subjects, and social conventions are the \u2018fiats\u2019 of plural subjects\u201d (p. 408).  Gilbert argues against the individualism of Max Weber, by arguing that collectivities are the central subject of the social sciences, and that collectivities cannot be subsumed under individualist concepts.  Thus Gilbert suggests that her theory offers support for holism over individualism (p. 3).I don't find this collectivist approach to \"individuals behaving as groups\" at all convincing, for several reasons. One is the point mentioned above about the heterogeneity of individual motivations and purposes within a group activity. This seems to imply that there couldn't be a coherent, univalent group intention that stands separate from the individuals who constitute the group. Instead, there are only the somewhat polyglot collective intentions within agents, with some degree of within-group communication and shaping about their shared collective purposes.Second, there is the general skeptical point about \"spooky\" social entities -- entities that are thought to have an existence independent from the states of agency and mind of the individuals who make up the social world.  How could one possibly imagine that there is a collective intention associated with the Burmese monks in 2007, standing separate and independent from the beliefs, assumptions, loyalties, and adherences of many individual monks and networks of monks?And here is a third puzzle. We need to have some idea of the concrete social processes through which group-oriented intentions are created at the individual level in particular social circumstances. We need to know something about the microfoundations of group formation.  It doesn't help to simply postulate \"collective intentions\"; we need to have a concrete sociology of the ways in which individuals come to have group-oriented beliefs, values, and motives.Finally, the \"autonomous collectivity\" view doesn't work very well when we try to use it to interpret the practice of gifted social scientists who attempt to explain collective action.  E. P. Thompson, James Scott, Chuck Tilly, Doug McAdam, and William Sewell all devote a lot of their effort to explaining how specific social collectivities came to define themselves as \"groups\" and came to act in a collective way.  But their approaches are invariably based on understanding the many threads of mobilization, structure, and meaning at the disaggregated level that eventually build up to a movement.  Thompson's metal workers, Scott's Southeast Asian peasant rebels, Tilly's Vendeans, McAdam's civil rights activists and followers, and Sewell's Marseillaise craftsmen all reflect the variation and concrete historical construction of individual consciousness within concrete political movements that confirms the variability and agentic nature of social movements and group identity.That said, there is still a crucial role for group-oriented thoughts and purposes at the level of at least some of the participants in a group. Without these group intentions at the individual level, we couldn't say that there is a group at all -- only a collection of individually oriented individual actors. Something like this must be true for at least some of the members of a group action:X regards a set of other individuals as constituting a group G to which he/she belongs;X believes that G has a common interest or need N;X is motivated to join in concert with others in G in such a way as to bring about N;X believes that some significant number of other members of the group share these collective thoughts, purposes, and motives;X believes that some significant number of G will act accordingly;and X has a consequent motivation to engage in the collective action.One additional condition seems to be pragmatically required in order for these conditions to arise: there must be some tangible process of communication and mobilization through which the group-oriented intentional states mentioned here are created in the various individuals.So there are mandatory group-oriented states of mind that are part of the constitution of a group.  But notice this key fact: these features of beliefs, intentions, and motives that I have mentioned are all located at the level of the individual actors. There is no higher-level collectivity that possesses an independent \"group intention\". So a group is constituted by the states of intentionality and belief of its members, and the concrete processes of communication and mobilization through which a degree of group-orientedness and coherence emerges within the states of mind of the participants.  Weber was right after all! Fundamentally, there are only three social-intentional states postulated here: affiliation, mutual recognition, and solidarity. And there is a postulate about the micro-social processes through which these are cultivated: mobilization, communication, and embodied social networks.And this analysis in turn is entirely compatible with the perspective of methodological localism that I've mentioned several times here."}, {"title": "Technical practices", "date": "Friday, March 20, 2009", "text": "What is involved in providing a sociology of technical practices?   (An earlier posting is also devoted to this question.)  Here I am thinking primarily of technical material practices -- building a house or a boat, distilling spirits, weaving a basket, maintaining a biological research lab, or repairing a photocopy machine.  There is a degree of continuity in the \"tacit knowledge\" and embodied skills and methods that are represented in the plans and actions of practitioners of these different human activities.  These bodies of knowledge and skill define the activity in a fairly specific way.  And there are indefinitely many other configurations of practices that might have accomplished the same task.  So a practice is historically and socially specific; it is the result of prior experimentation and adaptation in the context of needs, materials, and a physical environment within specific communities and locations.Here is a simple formulation of what I'm calling a technical practice:A practice is an ensemble of techniques, skills, and stylized responses, embedded in a population at a time, accomplishing a specific range of domestic tasks, and sustained through social mechanisms of transmission.   There are a number of fundamental questions that this definition raises.  How are practices embodied in individuals or groups? How do they proliferate, from one generation to the next and across social space?  How does a given state of practical knowledge change over time, through transmission, mutation, and deliberate refinement?   Do practices have a degree of stability over time, or do they morph so flexibly as to defy analysis?  Are there \"signatures\" for given ensembles of practices -- e.g. a set of features of device design in boat building or a set of techniques of water management in farming -- on the basis of which we can observe the proliferation and change of a practice over time and space? Is there a self-referential element in practices\u2014do practitioners deliberately or consciously modify their practices?The example of traditional boat design and building is a good one to illustrate a technical practice (suggested in the images above). The boat-building traditions of medieval Scandinavia represent a body of skill and technique transmitted from master to apprentice, with variation over time and place.  Farming practices in traditional agricultural societies provide another good example.  In this case, the practice involves knowledge concerning crops, animals, seeds, irrigation, fertilizer, timing, and response to the unexpected.  (This is the kind of local practical knowledge that James Scott describes in Seeing Like a State: How Certain Schemes to Improve the Human Condition Have Failed.)  It is embodied in local knowledge, folk beliefs, techniques and tools, and customs of a given population at a particular time. It is transmitted from practitioner to practitioner (perhaps parent to child) through training and imitation. Sometimes organizations play a causal role in transmission (e. g., a guild of boat designers and builders may deliberately control the transmission of relevant knowledge and skills from one individual to another).  And it seems likely enough that historians can in fact observe the proliferation of technical practices such as these over centuries of time by observing the spatial distribution of artifacts associated with the practice.  (Jon Elster discusses some aspects of the technical practices associated with traditional boat building in Explaining Technical Change: A Case Study in the Philosophy of Science.)A particularly interesting question is the degree to which technical practices are \u201cplastic\u201d over time and space.  How readily do they morph over time and space (akin to the way in which messages morph in the game of \u201ctelephone\u201d)? Is there an analogy between a practice and a gene, in which the gene encodes instructions for the phenotype\u2014producing a next-generation genotype? The stability of species through biological evolution depends on the fact that gene transcription is a highly accurate process, so the offspring is highly likely to encode the same bits of information as the parent. Is there the requisite stability within the domain of practices, or are we more likely to find significant differences in ostensibly similar practices across the villages of a region?The stability question turns on the mechanisms of replication that social practices embody.  Traditional social practices are not embodied in standard \"handbooks\" of best practice; instead, they are transmitted through networks of training and imitation.  So changes are likely to occur during the replication of the practice at the local level.  Innovation occurs as local illiterate but intelligent farmers or builders discover enhancements.  These innovations are imitated and reproduced by neighbors and changes accumulate.  Naturally, there is nothing inherently optimal or progressive about such a process.  Good ideas and innovations die out; mediocre practices persist; and sometimes genuine advances occur.Finally, the question about whether a technical practice has a specific signature -- a characteristic set of tools, patterns of land use, and products -- is crucial for our ability to track changes in practices historically.  With a signature -- for example, a characteristic form of ceramic glazing -- it is possible to track the spread of a practice across time and space. It is then possible to track changes in practice over time and geography by tracking the dispersion of tools and products. For example, a new technique in ceramics can often be pinpointed in a place at a time; then through archeological research it is often possible to track the diffusion of the innovation over the next century to other places.  And once we\u2019ve done that, we can ask productive questions about what the mechanisms of the diffusion of practical knowledge were: migration of farmers and artisans, trade routes, the sale of books and pamphlets, \u2026It seems that technical practices in pre-modern societies are of particular interest for a couple of reasons.  They give us a subject matter where it is possible to study local knowledge and skill in some detail.  They represent a domain of human activity where it is possible to track change over time and to form some hypotheses about the social mechanisms that underlie the diffusion of techniques.  And they are a fairly visible manifestation of some basic features of social life -- the harnessing of knowledge and skill to solving some of the practical problems of life, and the creation of innovations through which these basic material needs might be satisfied in a marginally better way.  And it wouldn't be surprising to discover that the mechanisms that underlie the maintenance and diffusion of traditional techniques are also found in the practical knowledge communities of technicians in the modern world -- photocopy machine repair specialists, airline mechanics, or lab technicians."}, {"title": "eighteen forty-eight", "date": "Wednesday, March 18, 2009", "text": "The revolutions of 1848 were the stage upon which the \"spectre haunting Europe\" danced.  Karl Marx, Mikhail Bakunin, Alexandre Herzen, Alexis de Tocqueville, and numerous other critical observers of Europe's trajectory looked at 1848 as a moment of continent-wide social and political revolution.  Mike Rapport's 1848: Year of Revolution is a very interesting effort to synthesize the movements and events of the year in a specific attempt to try to assess the degree to which events in Vienna, Berlin, Paris, Milan, and dozens of other European cities hang together as a \"year of revolution.\"  It's worth reading -- even for those for whom the history is pretty familiar.One reason that the book is so interesting is that the period itself is fascinating -- the events, the social movements and causes, the mechanisms through which social contention spread and intensified, and the personalities who were drawn into engagement and commentary.   The three men pictured above -- Tocqueville, Herzen, and Bakunin -- are only a sliver of the powerful and enduring personalities who played important roles during the critical weeks and months of unrest in a variety of cities.  Another reason for the interest of the book is Rapport's effort to separate out some of the causes and claims that led to mass protest in city after city -- relief of impoverishment, anger at the impersonal economic relations of the time, and the claims of ethnic and national groups for self-determination.  Fundamentally, Rapport suggests that mobilization and political demands flowed from two basic issues: the crushing poverty that segments of urban society experienced at mid-century, exacerbated by financial crisis and crop failures (Paris, Berlin), and the demand for political autonomy for national and ethnic groups (Italy, Germany, Czechoslovakia, Hungary).  Finally, the book is distinguished by its effort to treat the full canvas of unrest and violence across much of the continent -- not simply focusing on France, as one is sometimes inclined to do in thinking about 1848.Tocqueville's Recollections: The French Revolution of 1848 is a particularly intimate view of the events in Paris in spring, 1848.  Tocqueville was a Deputy of the National Assembly and an aristocrat, and in January 1848 he gave a prescient speech in the Chamber of Deputies:I believe that right now we are sleeping on a volcano ... can you not sense, by a sort of instinctive intuition ... that the earth is trembling again in Europe? Can you not feel ... the wind of revolution in the air? (quoted in Rapport, 42)In Recollections he chronicles his own experiences only a few months later, walking the streets of Paris during the street fighting in February 1848. He writes of his experience of February 23, 1848:I took my leave early and went straight to bed. Though my house was quite near the Foreign Office, I did not hear the firing which so greatly changed our fate, and I went to sleep unaware that I had seen the last day of the July Monarchy. (Recollections, 35)As I left my bedroom the next day, the 24th February, I met the cook who had been out; the good woman was quite beside herself and poured out a sorrowful rigmarole from which I could understand nothing but that the government was having the poor people massacred. I went down at once, and as soon as I had set foot in the street I could for the first time scent revolution in the air: the middle of the street was empty; the shops were not open; there were no carriages, or people walking; one heard none of the usual street vendors' cries; little frightened groups of neighbours talked by the doors in lowered voices; anxiety or anger disfigured every face. I met one of the National Guard hurrying along, rifle in hand, with an air of tragedy. I spoke to him but could learn nothing save that the government was massacring the people (to which he added that the National Guard would know how to put that right). (36)Rapport describes the massacre to which Tocqueville's cook and the National Guardsman apparently refer, as being the instigating event that led to successful insurrection in February.  It took place on rue des Capucines:When the marchers came to a halt, they pressed against the soldiers, and the officer, apparently hoping to nudge them back a little, ordered his men to 'Present bayonets!' As the troops performed the manoeuvre, a mysterious shot burst into the night air. In a knee-jerk response the nervous soldiers let off a volley, the bullets killing or wounding fifty people. (52)Tocqueville continues with his stroll on the morning of February 24:The boulevard along which we passed presented a strange sight.  There was hardly anyone to be seen, although it was nearly nine o'clock in the morning; no sound of a human voice could be heard; but all the little sentry boxes the whole way along that great street seemed on the move, oscillating on their bases and occasionally falling with a crash, while the great trees along the edge came tumbling into the road as if of their own accord.  These acts of destruction were the work of isolated individuals who set about it silently, methodically and fast, preparing materials for the barricades that others were to build. It looked exactly like some industrial undertaking, which is just what it was for most of those taking part. (38)(I've always thought it would be very interesting to take a group of students on a walking tour of the sites that Tocqueville mentions in Recollections -- though many of the locations must have disappeared in the work of Haussmann in reconfiguring the urban geography of Paris.  Timothy Clark has some very interesting analysis of Haussmann's designs in The Painting of Modern Life.)Marx's writings of the events of February and June in France are more analytical and more political at a nuts-and-bolts level.  Marx's face-to-face experience of the events was more fleeting than Tocqueville's -- Rapport recounts Marx's rather unsuccessful efforts as a political speaker, attempting to raise class consciousness (231).  (Blanqui and Proudhon both seem to have been more successful in this vein.) But Marx followed the events carefully through available journalism, and he made every effort to interpret the comings and goings in a way that made sense to him from the framework of historical materialism and politics as class conflict.  Here is how Marx described the outcome of the bloody June repression of the revolution in Paris:The Paris workers have been overwhelmed by superior forces; they have not succumbed to them.  They have been beaten, but it is their enemies who have been vanquished.  The momentary triumph of brutal violence has been purchased with the destruction of all the deceptions and illusions of the February revolution, with the dissolution of the whole of the old republican party, and with the fracturing of the French nation into two nations, the nation of possessors and the nation of the workers.  The tricolour republic now bears only one colour, the colour of the defeated, the colour of blood.  It has become the red republic. (N.Hr.Z., 29 June 1848)There remained only one way out: to set one section of the proletariat against the other. For this purpose the Provisional Government formed twenty-four battalions of Mobile Guards, each composed of a thousand young men between fifteen and twenty. For the most part they belonged to the lumpenproletariat, which in all towns, forms a mass quite distinct from the industrial proletariat. It is a recruiting ground for thieves and criminals of all sorts, living off the garbage of society, people without a definite trace, vagabonds, gens sans feu et sans aveu, varying according to the cultural level of their particular nation, never able to repudiate their lazzaroni character....  Thus the Paris proletariat was confronted by an army of 24,000 youthful, strong, foolhardy men, drawn from its own midst. The workers cheered the Mobile Guard as it marched through Paris! (Eighteenth Brumaire, 52-53)For me, one of the most interesting questions about 1848 is also the most basic: were these disturbances \"revolutionary,\" or were they something different and perhaps less historically significant over the long sweep of the century?  Were perhaps the \"February days\" better described as simply a short period of civil unrest and plebeian rioting; and were the \"June days\" simply a show-down with a state and military increasingly willing to use force to exert its will?  And might we think that it is best to look at Berlin, Milan, Vienna, and Paris in 1848 as largely separate social upheavals brought together in a relatively short period of time, but lacking the internal connections that would constitute a large revolution?  In other words, was 1848 really a \"year of revolution\", as Rapport says in his subtitle, or was it less dramatically, a year of unrest, rioting, and eventual political change?One reason for posing the question in these terms is the fact that the concept of \"revolution\" is a very imposing one.  When we think of \"revolutions,\" we think of the great examples -- France 1789, Russia 1917, China 1949.  We think of organized revolutionary parties; mass movements; political contest over control of the state; a program of fundamental social and economic change; and eventual seizure of state power. Against this sweeping set of unifying ideas, one might say that 1848 never reached this threshold of significance and unity.But perhaps this way of putting the question gets it backwards.  Perhaps it is the \"great\" revolutions that need a second look -- as Rapport suggests somewhere in a single sentence.  Perhaps it is the Russian Revolution that has been over-dramatized, and the widespread social and political upheavals of 1848 are more genuinely revolutionary than the seizure of power by the Bolsheviks in one corner of Europe.  The upheavals across Europe in 1848 are continental in scope; they involve a confluence of related claims (for autonomy for national groups, for poverty relief, for a democratic voice in government); and they did in fact result in \"regime change\" in Italy, France, Austria, and Germany.  And, as Rapport, Tocqueville, and Marx seem to agree -- by June 1848 in France, at least, there was a polarization around class lines and the primacy of the social question.So it's a simple question, really: were there any \"revolutions of 1848\"?"}, {"title": "Proto social inquiry", "date": "Saturday, March 14, 2009", "text": "We sometimes imagine that the current disciplines and methods of the social sciences represent a more or less inevitable set of approaches to the problem of understanding social phenomena.  But really, the latter task is much larger than the specific sets of disciplines and methods we have currently developed.  It is worth turning back the dial a bit and reflecting on the intellectual currents that led to contemporary programmes for the social sciences.Reflective people have been curious about the workings of the social world for as long as they have observed and commented upon the world of actions and institutions that they found around themselves. The Greeks were particularly interested in such things as the causes and outcomes of war (Thucydides), the properties of different kinds of states (Plato), the nature of the family (Aristotle), and so on. Often the focus was on the question of \u201cjustice\u201d\u2014the features of social arrangements that were justified on moral grounds.  But there are also many examples of philosophers and writers who were interested in the question of the how and why of social life: how does it work, what sorts of causes are at work, and why do certain kinds of outcomes occur (poverty, war, violence)?  These reflections often represented systematic thinking and observation, but they did not amount to what we would call \u201csocial science\u201d today.Several important changes occurred in Europe in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries that created a new impulse towards a different kind of study of the social world. One was eighteenth-century globalization. There was more knowledge available from travelers and colonial administrators about exotic social and familial practices in non-European places. The fact of religious and moral diversity was itself a startling discovery. This set of discoveries demonstrated the unavoidable fact of human social diversity. In the eighteenth century European thinkers raised questions deriving from the observed differences in social orders around the globe; so thinkers such as Rousseau and Montesquieu considered the significance and causes of different patterns of social organization in Europe, the New World, Africa, and Asia.  So the questions arose, how do these alternative social orders work, and why are there such wide differences in the first place?Second was an increasing recognition of the interconnectedness of economic and political life within European societies themselves. The physiocrats and the British political economists began to postulate causal connections between certain kinds of social facts\u2014settlement, trade, extension of agriculture, and law\u2014with certain kinds of outcomes\u2014the creation of the wealth of nations.  The physiocrats particularly highlighted the systematic relationships that exist between environment, land, food production, prices, rents, and other forms of economic development.  And debates about economic policies in the nineteenth century -- debates over the Corn Laws, for example -- likewise pointed towards the discovery of previously unobserved causal connections among economic facts.A third major change carried over into the nineteenth century\u2014the advance of modern industrial production, urbanization, bureaucratic states, class formation, migration, and a recognition of major social changes associated with urbanization and industrialization.  These changes, associated with the industrial revolution, set urgent new intellectual challenges to thoughtful observers; why were these changes taking place, and where were they going? Even Hegel expressed theoretical interest in the rise of the bureaucratic state -- Shlomo Avineri's Hegel's Theory of the Modern State makes a very clear case for the historical and empirical interests that Hegel had, along with his abstract philosophical theory of Right.  What would be the consequences for European (or French and English) civilization of these basic seismic shifts in the order of society? Thus, for example, Engels, Tocqueville, and Carlyle all reflected intensely on the meaning of Manchester for the new society (link, link, link).Fourth, a raft of novel and urgent social problems\u2014destitution, factory safety, crime, widespread hunger, deracination of the majority population, and the creation of enormous cities\u2014loomed large in the emerging interest in creating \u201csociology.\u201d How could a modern society cope with these problems?   (Gareth Stedman Jones's book Outcast London is particularly interesting for the insights it shed on how nineteenth-century observers, including Alfred Marshall, attempted to understand the problems and changes associated with London's rapid development.)  Parliamentary commissions on conditions of labor, public health, and other important social problems provided an empirical basis for more systematic study by theoretically minded thinkers.  The systematic collection of social statistics in turn created an intellectual demand for analysis in the form of the mathematics of probability and statistics.  (Ian Hacking's book, The Emergence of Probability: A Philosophical Study of Early Ideas about Probability, Induction and Statistical Inference, provides a nice account of some of these developments.)Finally was the rise of full-blown results in the natural sciences in the nineteenth century\u2014chemistry, electromagnetism, mechanics, geology, and biology. So the idea of studying and explaining the patterns of the social world with the same kinds of \"science\" was a fairly natural next step. The sudden impact of Darwinian ideas about biological evolution and the origin of species at late century was also important for some early sociologists. Founding social scientists as diverse as Marx, Durkheim, Comte, and Spencer were influenced by the models of empirical and logical rigor associated with positive natural science -- sometimes to the detriment of the future development of the social sciences.  (See earlier postings on positivism and naturalism for more about these shortcomings.)The point here is a simple one.  The agenda for \"understanding society\" is an old one, predating the modern social sciences by centuries.  And the needs that we have for understanding, explanation, and intervention in the area of complex social processes and problems inherently exceed the scope of the particular efforts we've made to date in constructing empirically rigorous social science. We need to keep our eyes open for new problems and new approaches in the social sciences, if we are to do a satisfactory job of understanding and coping with the social issues of the twenty-first century.  (See earlier postings on world sociology , French sociology, and Chinese sociology for more thinking about the need for innovation in the social sciences.)"}, {"title": "Inequalities in France", "date": "Wednesday, March 11, 2009", "text": "Inequalities in France are particularly volatile these days, with high unemployment, rising income inequality, increasingly evident differences in opportunities for young people from immigrant communities, and rather different levels of schooling available to different communities in France. Social conflict, strikes, and political disagreements are rising in France, and it will take skillful work by community leaders and public policy makers to arrive at a new and sustainable social consensus.  There seems to be a new social reality in France -- and to cope with these new realities, there is an urgent need for good social understanding of the causes of social distress, social inequality, and social conflict.Some recent work in French sociology, economics, and journalism provides some useful contributions towards arriving at that better understanding of contemporary France.Noteworthy along these lines is an important institute at the Sorbonne that focuses on inequalities in France, L'Observatoire des in\u00e9galit\u00e9s.  Researchers affiliated with the Observatoire have recently published the institute's second report on inequalities, L\u2019\u00e9tat des in\u00e9galit\u00e9s en France 2009 (link).  The volume includes extensive statistical information about social and economic inequalities in France, as well as a set of short, thoughtful essays offering analysis of several dimensions of current inequalities.  Observatoire Director Louis Maurin and President Patrick Savidan provide the introduction to the volume.  The book is a solid and illuminating snapshot of the situation of wealth, income, education, gender, and ethnic status in France today, and it provides a useful empirical baseline for understanding current debates and conflicts in France during this period of severe economic crisis.The major categories of measurement include income and poverty, employment, education, life style, social origin, gender, age, nationality and immigration, space and territory, health, housing, and comparisons with Europe and the world.The book brings forward a great range of social data.  Several graphs and charts caught my eye as being particularly interesting.  Here's a map of poverty across the face of France:And here is a graph indicating the rate and volume of poverty over several decades.  The second panel indicates a fairly large decline in the percentage of poverty since 1970, with relatively little change in the past ten years.Women's equality in the workplace appears to have made more progress than in many other countries.  Since 1951 median female salary has increased from about 65% of median male salary to about 82% in 2005:And the percentage of adults with higher education is also an interesting variable.  Overall, 17.7% of adults have a two-year or four-year degree beyond the Baccalaureat (roughly, high school diploma).  This compares to a U.S. figure of about 27% of the adult population with an bachelor's degree (link), with an additional percentage of adults with a two-year associate's degree.  This is especially important because another table documents that 72% of young people with the Bac+2 have regular jobs, compared with only 43% of young people lacking a diploma.  Clearly, access to higher education is a critical component in economic opportunity in France, as it is in the United States.The section on health is interesting, though it would be useful to have more public health variables and more disaggregation across regions and communities.  In the fifteen years between 1976 and 1991 life expectancy for both men and women has increased by about three years, and the gap between male and female life expectancy has remained wide at about seven years (76 compared to 83 for the period 1991-1999).  In general, this volume indicates that French public opinion and public policy seems to pay more attention to the situation of \"handicapped\" people than is the case in the United States.The section on nationalities and immigrants is also eye-opening.  15% of immigrant households fall below the poverty line, compared with 5.6% of non-immigrant households.  And households of North African origin show a staggering poverty rate of 22.6%.  The report makes it plain that a significant part of this differential derives from overt discrimination; a candidate with a French surname is between 1.5 and 3 times more likely to receive a job interview than a French resident of Moroccan origin.An excellent companion to this book is La France invisible, prepared by St\u00e9phane Beaud, Joseph Confavreux, and Jade Lindgaard.  (See an earlier posting on French sociology for a brief discussion of this book.)  This book makes an extensive effort to catalogue the many slices of French society that are often overlooked; this is the sociological reality that underlies many of the forms of inequality described in L\u2019\u00e9tat des in\u00e9galit\u00e9s en France 2009.   La France invisible is not primarily interested in statistical measurement; there is not a single table or graph in the 650-page volume.  Instead, it is an effort at sociological description and ethnographic insight into the situations of daily life of the various disadvantaged minority groups in France.  The editors link their work to an earlier book by Pierre Bourdieu, La Misere du monde, in 1993.  Their goal is to give voice to people and groups who have been largely unheard in the larger society in the past thirty years.   And they have made a very powerful contribution to this effort.Combine these books with the careful and intense fieldwork by Didier Lapeyronnie in Ghetto urbain, and you have a great survey of social inequalities in France today.  (See an earlier posting on segregation in France that refers to Lapeyronnie's work.)  Lapeyronnie's work documents in great sociological detail, some of the social realities that define the situation of inequality, discrimination, and segregation that limit many of France's immigrant communities today.  And it is self-evident, that France must address these issues in ways consistent with its highest civic values -- or social conflict is inevitable.I am sure that every country is developing its own forms of analysis of the new social realities that the twenty-first century confronts us with.  And it is an interesting fact that there are persistent differences across national traditions of social inquiry.  We certainly need new approaches and new mental frameworks in terms of which to understand the rapidly changing social circumstances of the cities and populations of the world today. Berlin, Oslo, and Milan are probably creating equally interesting new ideas about how to conceptualize emerging social realities.  But even in this global world of ideas, the obstacle of language makes transmission of these research traditions difficult.  The contemporary French sociological framework is sufficiently distinctive from American and British sociology to serve as a highly interesting point of contrast and innovation for fresh thinking everywhere."}, {"title": "Metaphors for history", "date": "Tuesday, March 10, 2009", "text": "What kind of thing is \"history\"? Think of the history of the Roman Empire, or the history of Tokugawa Japan, or the history of the American banking system.  We want to be able to conceptualize these complex stories as possessing some kind of unity over centuries of time, thousands of locations, and millions of lives; we want to be able to identify common threads of development, common themes or topics that continue to recur throughout the history of the period.  And yet it is plain that history consists of unmeasured diversity and heterogeneity as well -- individuals, psychologies, local conditions, aberrant princes, external threats, famines, floods, and panics.   So historians are led to adopt different kinds of metaphors to attempt to provide a degree of unity to their subject.  There are quite a few different metaphors that have been used to characterize history: a river, a tree, a labyrinth, an ocean, a landscape.  Several are particularly worth unpacking, but the metaphor that I prefer is \"pathway.\"Here is how the river metaphor might work as a way of thinking about the \"course\" of history.  Rivers have tributaries -- rivulets of water flowing down hill into the broader concourse.   History has \"streams\" of contributing events that lead to the larger outcome -- the confluence of developments in the French medieval rural economy, the development of the fiscal crisis of the Ancien regime, and the emergence of a town-based bourgeoisie, for example, coming together to contribute to the unfolding of the French Revolution.  There is a seeming unity to a river over time, even though the constituent water simply passes through continuously; analogously, one might view history as a \"stream\" of events that individual humans pass through, constituting a larger and more stable historical current.  (Though of course we won't forget the Heraclitus paradox.)  Rivers are to some extent constrained -- by existing topography, but also by human artifacts (dams, levees, flood walls).  Historical developments too are constrained by circumstances such as agricultural productivity, population levels, and warfare.  Rivers sometimes change their course -- for example, the frequently changing course of the Yellow River over many centuries. But more commonly they become longstanding features of the terrain over centuries or millenia.  Analogously, there is at least the semblance of long, steady periods of continuity of human affairs within human history -- interrupted by crises and turning points.  (See an earlier posting on the idea of a turning point.)  Rivers have a direction of flow -- from north to south, from high ground to lower ground.  And some interpreters of history have argued analogously for a direction of change in history as well -- towards \"progress,\" \"modernization,\" greater administrative intensity, higher standards of living for the population, or greater democracy, for example.  And rivers have a powerful momentum of their own -- we can be swept away in the currents of the Mississippi River, as John Reed was swept up in the events of the Russian Revolution.The river metaphor captures some of our intuitive thinking about history -- tributaries, currents, stretches of turbulence.  But it also conveys a necessity or inevitability that fails to come to grips with the deep contingency of history.  A river has an inexorable course of flow -- from high ground to low ground.  And the topography essentially determines the shape and configuration of the river bed.  This metaphor suggests that history too has an inevitable course or direction -- which is profoundly untrue.How about the idea of history as a tree?  Here, the idea is that there are \"branches\" in history -- points where developments could have gone \"left\" or \"right\", and the next phases of history are dependent on the specific branches that have been taken before.  America could have invested in canals rather than railroads -- and its transportation history and subsequent urbanization would have been significantly different. (Robert Fogel makes an argument along these lines in Railroads and American Economic Growth: Essays in Econometric History; here is a nice, short description of his argument.)  The analogy isn't exactly between \"history\" and \"tree\"; instead, it is between the space of hypothetical historical possibilities and the branches of a tree.  Actual history is one specific pathway through this tree of possibilities.  Finally, trees have systems of \"roots\" -- the structures under the ground and out of sight that explain the nutrition and growth of the tree.  And how often historians turn to expressions like \"the roots of the Cold War extend back to X, Y, and Z.\"This metaphor does a better job of capturing the contingency of history, in that it highlights that the actual course of history is simply the aggregate result of the branches or choices taken previously -- with the clear understanding that other routes through the space of possibilities were possible as well.  One of the obvious difficulties with the tree metaphor, though, is the extreme uncertainty that exists about the branches, the hypothetical alternative outcomes that might have put a given society on a different trajectory.  For any given major historical event we can speculate with varying degrees of rigor about how things might have come out differently; but we can't really go very far down the route of the \"alternative history\" that might have ensued.  So the idea of a \"tree diagram of alternative histories\" is only a metaphor, not something that could be accomplished through historical research.  (Niall Ferguson has an interesting book on \"counterfactual history\"; Virtual History: Alternatives and Counterfactuals.)So here is a third possible metaphor for history: history is an accumulation of pathways and contingencies that embed human action over time.  I find that this metaphor works well as a way to characterize the course of history.  Paths are created by purposive agents, going somewhere with an understanding of the topography. Pathways become roadways, and they become systems of constraint and opportunity.  And they sometimes become the elements or segments of larger systems with long historical and human consequences (for example, the Roman road system illustrated at Ambrussum above). Road systems illustrate the meaning of \u201cpath-dependence\u201d; once the pathway exists, other routes across the terrain become less likely. And the metaphor illustrates as well the perpetual interaction of agent and structure that good historians almost always emphasize; the plasticity of social entities; the contingency of their specific properties; and their constraining power influencing human choices.The pathways metaphor incorporates both diachronic and synchronic elements into our conceptualization of history.  At a given time, history presents us with a given set of embodied constraints and opportunities that represent the accretion of the past as a context for the present.  The system of roads penetrating through a medieval town represent a snapshot of its history over a thousand years -- and a set of frustrating obstacles to the contemporary driver.  Marx puts the weight of history's legacy in these terms in the Eighteenth Brumaire:Men make their own history, but they do not make it as they please; they do not make it under self-selected circumstances, but under circumstances existing already, given and transmitted from the past. The tradition of all dead generations weighs like a nightmare on the brains of the living.But there is a diachronic aspect of the metaphor as well: the structures that constrain the present today are themselves involved in a temporally extended process of modification and accretion from yesterday to today to tomorrow.  The road system continues to evolve in response to contemporary needs and wants, and presents a new set of constraints and opportunities to the generation to come.On this approach, history doesn't have any ultimate directionality; it is simply the sum of a long series of inventions, actions, interventions, and accidents over decades or centuries.  At the same time, it is subject to a degree of explicability, in that earlier moments of historical development set the stage for choices and inventions in the next phase.  Outcomes are \"path-dependent\", in that they depend critically on the circumstances and accidents of the past.  But at the same time, there is a degree of \"sunk costs,\" social momentum, and embodied infrastructure that make some historical developments much more likely than others."}, {"title": "Is a rail network a social structure?", "date": "Saturday, March 7, 2009", "text": "figures: RER map of Paris; E. J. Marey's graphical representation of Paris-Lyon train schedules, 1885What role does a rail network play within an adequate ontology of society?  Is a rail system primarily a set of physical assets, a set of administrative procedures, or a set of embodied opportunities and constraints for other members of society?  The answer is, a transportation system has elements of all of these.A rail system provides convenient transportation among a number of places, while providing no service at all between other pairs of locations.  You can get from Porchefontaine to Sevran Livry with only a change of trains at St. Michel - N Dame in about 30 minutes -- whereas from Point X to Point Y there is no convenient transportation connection by Metro or RER.  This means, among other things, that some parts of Paris are much more tightly integrated than others.  It is possible for residents of arrondissement X to shop and work in arrondissement Y very conveniently, whereas this would not be true for arrondissement Z.So a rail system certainly has direct effects on social behavior; it structures the activities of the two million or more Parisians by making some places of residence, work, shopping, and entertainment substantially more accessible than other places.  And there are a number of other social characteristics that are structured by the commuter rail system as a consequence: for example, patterns of class stratification of neighborhoods, patterns of diffusion of infectious disease, patterns of ethnic habitation around the city, patterns of diffusion of social styles and dialect, ...  In brief, a rail system has definite social effects.  It creates opportunities and constraints that affect the ways in which individuals arrange their lives and plan their daily activities.  And other forms of social behavior and activity are conveyed through the conduits established by the transport system.Moreover, a rail system is a physical network that has an embodied geometry and spatiality on the ground.  Through social investments over decades or more, tracks, stations, power lines, people movers, and fuel depots have been created as physical infrastructure for the transportation network.  Lines cross at junctions, creating the topology of a network of travel; and the characteristics of travel are themselves elements of the workings of the network -- for example, the rate of speed feasible on various lines determines the volume of throughput of passengers through the system.  And neighborhoods and hotels agglomerate around important hubs within the system.In addition to this physical infrastructure, there is a personnel and management infrastructure associated with a rail system as well: a small army of skilled workers who maintain trains, sell tickets, schedule trains, repair tracks, and myriad other complex tasks that must be accomplished in order for the rail system to carry out its function of efficiently and promptly providing transportation.  This human organization is surely a \"social structure,\" with some level of internal corrective mechanisms that maintain the quality of human effort, react to emergencies, and accomplish the business functions of the rail system.  This structure exists in the form of training procedures, operating manuals, and processes  of supervision that maintain the coordination needed among ticket agents in stations, repairmen in the field, track inspectors, engineers, and countless other railroad workers.  And this structure is fairly resilient in the face of change of personnel; it is a bureaucratized structure that makes provision for the replacement of individuals in all locations within the organization over time.So a rail network has structural characteristics at multiple levels.  The physical network itself has structural characteristics (nodes, rates of travel, volume of flow of passengers and freight). This can be represented statically by the network of tracks and intersections that exist (like the stylized map of the RER above); dynamically, we can imagine a \"live\" map of the system representing the coordinated surging of multiple trains throughout the system, throughout the course of the day.  The railroad organization has a bureaucratic structure -- represented abstractly by the organizational chart of the company, but embodied in the internal processes of training, supervision, and recruitment that manage the activities of thousands of employees.  And the social and technical ensemble that these constitute in turn creates an important structure within the social landscape, in that these physical and human structures determine the opportunities and constraints that exist for individuals to pursue their goals and purposes.A general problem that confronts assertions about \"social structures\" is the question, what factors give the hypothesized structure a degree of permanence over time?  Why should we not expect that social structures will morph quickly in response to changing uses and demands by opportunistic actors within them?  A rail system provides a somewhat more definite answer to this question than is possible for most putative social structures: the physicality of the system is itself a barrier to rapid, radical structural change.  The locations of the great rail terminus stations in Paris have not changed in the past century.  And this is at least in part a consequence of the vast \"sunk costs\" that are associated with the embodied structure of track, intersection, and station that had developed over the course of the first fifty years of French railroad expansion.  So the need for a passenger from Dijon to Strasbourg to convey himself/herself from the Gare de Lyon (1900) to the Gare de l'Est (1849) is exactly the same today as it was in 1900."}, {"title": "Social entrepreneurs", "date": "Tuesday, March 3, 2009", "text": "Social entrepreneurs are people who want to bring about non-routine projects, collaborations, or organizations where they didn't previously exist in order to solve a perceived social problem. This is very different from working within an existing organization and using its official resources to bring about a particular result. An example might be a community activist who conceives of a storefront operation providing financial advice to local homeowners facing foreclosure. In order to bring this about, he or she needs to secure financial commitments from some potential partners, recruit expert volunteers from others, and gain cooperation from community neighbors to trust and use the service. And, finally, the project needs to deliver a reasonable percentage of its promised benefits -- some number of troubled mortgage holders need to be successful in retaining their homes thanks to the service.There are examples of highly successful social entrepreneurs everywhere -- think of Geoffrey Canada and the creation of the Harlem Children's Zone (link), Matt and Jessica Flannery and the creation of Kiva, a successful peer-to-peer micro-lending program (link), Father William Cunningham and Eleanor Josaitis and the founding of FocusHope in Detroit (link), or Millard and Linda Fuller, founders of Habitat for Humanity (link). And we don't have to turn to the high-profile cases to find great examples of skillful social entrepreneurship -- every city is home to community leaders and innovators who have created coalitions or organizations that have significantly contributed to solutions for important social problems.It is interesting to notice that the idea of social entrepreneurship brings in the social in two different ways.  Social entrepreneurs are involved in addressing social problems; so the object of the entrepreneurial activity is to enhance some aspect of the public good or to solve a social problem, rather than achieving a private \"return on investment\".  But second, social entrepreneurship depends on putting together voluntary coalitions among a number of independent social actors in a sustained common effort.  A purely private and self-financed effort to provide meals for homeless teenagers would be a laudable effort; but I'm not sure I would call it \"social entrepreneurship.\"  It doesn't confront the key problem of locating potential partners, engaging them in the project, and sustaining the collaboration over the long term.  So a social entrepreneur involves social cooperation at the input side and public goods on the output side.  The question here is a simple one: what are some of the factors that permit some people to be successful in efforts at social entrepreneurship and others strikingly not?  There are also other groups of people -- those who would never consider the idea of creating a new social project in any circumstances and those who look at social causes as a moment for personal gain, for example.  But just consider the well-intentioned actors who undertake to put together a successful coalition for the public good -- what distinguishes between those who succeed and those who fail?  A couple of related concepts in the social sciences are immediately relevant to this question -- in particular, the concept of social capital and the idea of a social network. Putting the point very intuitively -- success in a project of social entrepreneurship is more likely if the agent has more social relationships of trust and confidence with other influential players to bring to bear in the effort. And likewise, he/she is more likely to succeed in some rough proportion to the depth and weight of the social networks within which the agent is located. (Robert Putnam's Bowling Alone : The Collapse and Revival of American Community is one place where the idea of social capital is applied to contemporary society.)  Crudely, the individual's capacity to make things happen is multiplied by the strength of the organizations he/she can call upon in support of the effort. This point segues to the point about social networks: if the agent is in a position to call upon the support and collaboration of other resource holders as a result of personal and professional relationships, then he/she is more likely to succeed in putting into place the elements needed for establishment of the project.  Let's apply these points to our community activist. Suppose this individual has developed strong relationships with regional foundations, businesses,  semi-governmental organizations, and elected officials. And suppose that these relationships have resulted in a deep reservoir of trust in the activist's perseverance and integrity. Finally, suppose the agent has a well-developed plan for establishing and maintaining the center with high credibility of success. He/she has a good \"business plan\" for the social project.  It is believable that this actor is much more likely to succeed than his twin with very weak personal and organizational relationships.  Our organizer will have a good chance of persuading these potential partners to make the financial commitments and commitments of engagement needed to put the financial counseling center in place. And if the center is successful over several years, it is also likely that the agent's fund of trust and confidence will deepen -- making the next project even more achievable.  This part of the story concerns the social location of the actor -- the networks and organizations the agent can turn to in seeking support for the project. What are the features of personality and character that support and deepen these elements of social capital?  Here are several. Trust and credibility are essential. This is true because the success of the enterprise requires the continuing cooperation of voluntary partners.  The agent needs to inspire trust in the partners.  And inspiring trust isn't just a fact about current behavior or a persuasive smile -- the agent needs to have a track record of behavior that validates that trust as well. Second, credible competence is crucial as well. The agent needs to be able to make the case that the project can succeed and that he/she has the skills needed to carry it out. This too depends heavily on one's history -- the best evidence of future competence is demonstrated past competence.  This also implies a third characteristic -- a need to be able to communicate clearly and credibly. Simply being a good communicator isn't enough, but failing to communicate well certainly weakens the likelihood of success in bringing together a durable partnership.  And we can't overlook the characteristics of originality and imagination.  Solving difficult social problems requires new ideas and innovative approaches.  So the successful social entrepreneur probably needs to have a focused imagination that permits him/her to conceive of new potential solutions -- or at least recognize them when other people invent them.One wonders, finally, if there is a dimension of empathy and emotional intelligence that plays an important differentiating role among different social actors in this kind of activity.  How important is it for the social entrepreneur to be able to understand and express the human importance of the issue? And how important are these skills in sustaining coalitions once they have begun?  It seems believable that this is very important indeed.It appears that social entrepreneurship is ready for some serious academic study, along the lines of studies of private entrepreneurship over the past several decades.  Here is a report of a preliminary study of Ashoka fellows in social entrepreneurship (link). And the Center for Social Innovation at Stanford Graduate School of Business offers some interesting examples as well (link)."}, {"title": "Disaffected youth", "date": "Friday, February 27, 2009", "text": "Every city seems to have its floating population of disaffected youth -- school dropouts, occasional workers, drug users, skateboarders, hooligans, street people.  How much of a problem is this?  What are its dimensions?  What are the social causes that influence the size and nature of this population in Detroit, Manchester, Cologne, or Novosibirsk?  And are there social programs that can significantly diminish the number of young people who wind up in this category?As for the importance of the problem, there are at least two aspects.  In some times and places this population becomes a source of violence -- youth gangs, football hooliganism, shop window breakage, and skinhead attacks on racial minorities, gays, or other targets.  But second, whether violent or passive, the precipitation of a sub-class of young people with no skills, no jobs, and no futures is a huge social cost for the societies that produce them.Here I'm mostly interested in the processes of neglect and social-economic disadvantage that play into the mentality of some young people, leading to the formation of an individual social psychology that brings about the low-level anti-social behavior that is observed.  Basically -- why do some young people drop out of the process of gaining an education, building a career, forming a family, and looking forward to the future, and instead spend their time hanging out in the streets?  The skinhead phenomenon adds another element that is also worth understanding but is not the primary interest here -- a degree of organizational effort by political entrepreneurs who work towards mobilizing disaffected youth around racist and nationalist agendas. This falls under the category of social mobilization studied by people such as Doug McAdam, Sidney Tarrow, or Charles Tilly.  But here I'm more interested here in the process of socialization at the individual level that leads to the phenomenon of disaffection.  (Several earlier posts have addressed the mobilization part of the story -- for example, here.)Here is a very interesting academic study by Robert MacDonald of the making of a \"youth underclass\" in the UK.  Here is how MacDonald frames his problem of research:Most young people in the UK make relatively \u2018successful\u2019, unproblematic transitions from school to work and adulthood. What do we call those that do not? Labels imply explanation, not just description. Terms with academic and policy currency tend to define such young people by something they are not or by their presumed social and economic distance and dislocation from \u2018the rest\u2019. How we might best describe, explain and label the experience and problem of so-called \u2018socially excluded\u2019, \u2018disconnected youth\u2019 is the focus of the paper.To use the term \"disaffected\" is to bring a Durkheimian mindset to the table; it is to offer the beginnings of a diagnosis of the problem as well as a description.  The phrase \"disaffected\" (or its cognate, \"demoralized\") presents the problem as one of disconnection from prevailing social values and alienation from a set of moral ideas about how to behave.  The \"disaffected\" no longer believe in the old chestnuts about working hard, listening to one's parents, showing respect to others, obeying the law, and conforming to society's expectations.  So on this line of thought, the anti-social behavior of young people in this category derives from their \"demoralization\" -- their failure, or society's failure, to absorb a compelling set of normative standards about personal and social conduct.But here is a slightly different tack we might take here.  Perhaps disadvantaged youth disbelieve because they have lost all confidence in the underlying promise: conform to these norms and you will have a decent life.  In other words, maybe the psychological cause of these forms of youth behavior is economic rather than moral; they are deeply discouraged about the possibility of a pathway to a better future than the world they seem around themselves at the moment.  \"Hopeless and angry\" is a different state of mind than \"disaffected.\"And what about the factor of motivation and personal ambition?  To what extent is normal youth development propelled by internal factors of motivation and aspiration?  And how much of a role does a social context that \"demotivates\" young people play in this picture?Another line of thought has emerged out of research on youth gangs -- the idea of the positive forms of solidarity and community that are provided by the gang as a welcoming social group.  Young people who have lost the social support of their families and other traditional organizations may find that the street gang is the closest thing to \"home\" that they are able to locate.  These are social groups with their own codes of behavior -- even though their largest effects are profoundly anti-social.A common recourse when it comes to trying to explain these kinds of outcomes is to refer to various \"breakdowns\" -- breakdowns of the traditional family, of schools, of religion, of community organizations, or of public values.  These are the institutions through which young people form their social psychologies, their identities, and their basic values.  But if the young person lacks an emotionally meaningful connection to adults through some of these institutions, where will those positive social values come from?Finally, it is worth noting that poverty and socio-economic disadvantage are not the only settings where youth disaffection occurs.  Many observers in the United States have written about the use of drugs by affluent suburban high school students and other forms of involvement in anti-social activities.  Wayne Wooden's Renegade Kids, Suburban Outlaws: From Youth Culture to Delinquency documents some of this behavior.Why is this an important problem for \"understanding society\"?  Because the social processes through which the next generation of citizens -- children, teenagers, and youth -- is shaped are deeply influential on the nature of the society that will develop in twenty to forty years.  If \"disaffection,\" \"anger,\" \"demoralization,\" and a propensity for anti-social behavior are inculcated in a large minority of the youth cohort, then society is likely to go through some very hard times in the coming decades.It's relatively easy to find some dimensions of these issues on the web.  Here is an interesting report on \"football hooliganism\" prepared by Dr. Geoff Pearson of the Football Industry Group.  Here is a blog posting from the UK on youth gangs and terrorist organizations.  Here is a quick report on skinheads."}, {"title": "Sociologie de Paris?", "date": "Monday, February 23, 2009", "text": "What might be involved in creating a new sociology of Paris? Paris is a particularly good subject for a new urban sociology. It is a gritty, diverse, and dynamic city, and a city displaying unceasing chaotic surges and currents of social life. It is a global city, both in Saskia Sassen's sense (strong networked interconnection with other global cities) and in the sense of being a magnet for immigrants from every part of the world. It is an intellectual city, a conflictual city, a city with continuous poverty and deprivation, as well as conspicuous wealth, and a city with high unemployment and aggressive policing. And it is a city with ubiquitous transit (dozens of lines serving hundreds of stations), implying thorough urban mobility; but also invisible boundaries marking the edges of the social circuits of various social and ethnic groups.If we were beginning anew, we might start with the racial and ethnic diversity the city contains and the circuits of social life that these many groups traverse. Ride the RER from Chatelet to Charles de Gaulle and you may get an impression of a great salad spinner of humanity -- everyone all mixed up on one long subway carriage. But this impression is probably mistaken -- Didier Lapeyronnie's analysis of the French ghetto puts stop to that thought (post) and highlights the very sharp separations that exist between immigrant neighborhoods and the rest of French cities. So a sociology of Paris needs to uncover the distinct social worlds it encompasses.And we would want to map the terrain of poverty and deprivation in Paris. Who are the poor? How is poverty caused and reproduced in Paris? What groups are most likely to be homeless and hungry (SDF -- sans domicile fixe)? And how large a factor does immigration play in this question? Recall the deadly fires several years ago in Paris -- these were temporary housing facilities for homeless immigrants (story).  A recent collaboration among sociologists and journalists picks up this thread in La France invisible.  The creators of the project have undertaken to give voice to the many categories of poor and disempowered people in France: accident\u00e9s au travail, banlieusards, d\u00e9localis\u00e9s, discrimin\u00e9s, disparus, dissimul\u00e9s, drogu\u00e9s, ...  These short pieces provide thumbnail descriptions of the circumstances of life of the people involved in these categories, often incorporating an interview or two.  The hope here is to give a visceral glimpse to the reader of the life difficulties involved in these (alphabetically organized) categories.A related subject for a new descriptive sociology of Paris has to do with the patterns of public health that the city embodies. What sorts of health disparities exist across different social groups? How are these differentials patterned socially across the city itself?  Here is a very brief discussion of the issue of health disparities in France, presented at the \"Congre\u0300s national des Observatoires re\u0301gionaux de la sante\u0301 2008 - Les ine\u0301galite\u0301s de sante\u0301\" in Marseille, 16-17 octobre 2008.  But this report is very brief and is not city- or region-specific.  By contrast, a central focus of public health research in the U.S. is on the patterns of health disparities that can be found in cities such as Detroit, Chicago, or New York, often accompanied by detailed social mapping of the results.And what about employment and education? What are the mechanisms through which education, social position, age, race, and ethnicity play out across social groups to create the specific patterns of employment opportunity that Paris presents? Jobs and education are highly volatile issues everywhere in France today -- witness the current waves of strikes and demonstrations about unemployment and education reform. What are the social mechanisms underlying these systems? (Pierre Bourdieu and Jean-Claude Passeron addressed the social class aspects of the French educational system in Les h\u00e9ritiers (1964).)  To what extent do the concrete institutions of training, education, and job recruitment work to reproduce significant inequalities across social groups?Social mapping analysis would help in each of these areas. GIS maps of the city demonstrating the spatial distribution of poverty, crime, bad schools, police brutality, and 2-1-1 calls would tell us a lot about the social geography of the city.  It would be enormously interesting to be able to have access to an interactive map of the city, combining many social variables of interest.  In fact, that social map would help make sense of the long RER ride mentioned above. As you pass through neighborhoods ranging from affluent to graffiti-inscribed banlieue, you would be able to make the connection to some of the social realities that underlie these glimpses. Surprisingly, though, these sorts of spatial analyses and maps don't seem to exist yet for Paris or other French cities -- or at least, they are not easily located on the web. Is this a specific feature of the French sociological discourse -- with French researchers perhaps more attuned to discursive theory and less to spatial analysis and empirical study?One might paraphrase the point here as saying that Paris deserves what Chicago received in the 1920s through 1940s in the form of the \"Chicago School of Sociology\" -- a focused, empirically rigorous, analytically astute series of efforts to come to grips with the complex social realities of the city, and to provide a better diagnosis of the social problems of the city in a way that supports more effective social policy.  It's possible that this type of approach already exists within some of the social science research institutes of French universities.  If so, I hope that readers will point us in the right direction.(Michel Pin\u00e7on and Monique Pin\u00e7on-Charlot have a recent book on the sociology of Paris.  Here is an interview with Michel Pin\u00e7on in LeJournalduNet on the subject of the wealthy class in France and an interview on the \"bourgeoisification\" of Paris. And C\u00e9line B\u00e9raud and Baptiste Coulmont offer a very good account of the recent development of French sociology in Les courants contemporains de la sociologie. Baptiste Coulmont maintains an interesting academic website and blog here.)"}, {"title": "Regional interconnectedness", "date": "Saturday, February 21, 2009", "text": "Chicago, Milwaukee, and Detroit are part of a large economic region in the upper Midwest of the United States, which is sometimes referred to as the Great Lakes Region. There are hundreds of lesser cities within this regional system -- Erie, Toledo, Rockford, Grand Rapids, .... What are the economic interdependencies that exist among these cities? How important are these relationships in the overall pattern of economic development that each city demonstrates? And of critical practical importance, how much leverage exists for development planners in these major cities to enhance their city's progress through adroit use of these relationships? Is there a possible gain for Milwaukee in virtue of the net effect of its relationships to Detroit? Or is each metropolitan region mostly autarkic with respect to the other?There seem to be several theoretical possibilities. One is that there are in fact major point-to-point economic interdependencies among cities within a large economic region and that these are significantly different across different pairs of cities. It might be that the growth or contraction of auto manufacturing in Detroit is tightly enough linked to supplier companies in Milwaukee that what helps Detroit also helps Milwaukee.Another possibility is that the regional impact is systemic rather than point-to-point. Here the idea is that the great metropolitan regions within a regional economy contribute to the macroeconomic environment for the region -- labor demand, growth, consumer demand, and fiscal shares. The region sets the basic parameters -- transport cost, commodity prices, and the current distribution of population and talent. But the impact of, say, Milwaukee on Toledo is entirely mediated through the macroeconomic environment of the region. And to the extent that there are correlations of advance and decline, this is the result of regional \"pulsing\" of macroeconomic factors rather than specific city-to-city interactions.A third possibility is that each metropolitan region is largely independent within the larger region, so that regional economic performance is simply the aggregation of the performance of the component metropolitan regions (cities). And if this is the case, then we would expect a low degree of correlation on economic development across the cities of a region.  (But in this case it is more difficult to explain why we refer to the set of cities as an economic \"region\" at all, since this term implies a degree of economic similarity and interdependence.)Let's look at the first possibility more closely. Logically, the possibility of this kind of interdependency appears to depend on the existence of directed flows of activities between the places that do not extend to other places. There must be some network reality to the region within which A and B are proximate nodes. What else could provide the mechanism of mutual causal influence upon which the postulated interdependence depends?So what are the inter-city connections that might support tight point-to-point linkages? The direct industry-to-industry dependencies mentioned above are most obvious. More furniture manufacturing in Grand Rapids might stimulate a surge in business for the plastic mesh producers in Rockford, to complete those great Aeron chairs. The input-output tables measuring exchange activity between the two cities might be extensive or minimal.Here is another possible connection -- the talent needs in some cities might lead to the growth of universities in cities in other parts of the region. In a hypothetical history of the Midwest, Chicago might extend its current concentration of research universities and become a \"knowledge center\" for the region, supplying the inventors, architects, accountants, and lawyers for the region. In fact, specialized education and research is more diffused than this; but isn't this essentially the role that Boston played for a century or so for the northeast?A third possibility -- two cities might be tightly linked through the existence of particularly efficient transportation or communication systems between them.  Are Seattle and San Francisco more tightly linked economically because they are both Pacific Ocean ports with low-cost transport between them?  What about Minneapolis, St. Louis, and New Orleans, linked by the barges of the Mississippi River?Historically there are fairly good measures of economic interconnectedness between places. We can examine the correlation of time series of prices, wages, and profits to measure the degree of economic integration that exists among A, B, and C. Likewise, we can examine the patterns of growth or contraction of employment over time; do Milwaukee, Toledo, and Detroit demonstrate synchronized patterns of growth and contraction in business activity and overall employment over long periods of time? And the transport links mentioned here are a particularly fundamental source of economic integration in 19th-century studies of China, France, or the United States. (It's possible that contemporary data would suggest that all U.S. cities are equally integrated by these measures, since market integration has increased dramatically through transport and communications improvements.)The most compact basis for studies of regional integration derives from the original insights of central place theory -- William Cronon's analysis of Chicago and its hinterlands, Nature's Metropolis: Chicago and the Great West, is an outstanding example of this approach. And G. William Skinner's analysis of the urban hierarchies of late imperial China falls in this general approach. What these examples do not permit, though, is analysis of inter-city dependencies across a region.  At a very different level, these are the kinds of questions Saskia Sassen is asking about \"world\" cities. She attempts to identify the linkages that exist among major cities with respect to financial flows, internet traffic, and telephone calls.  See earlier posts on each of these approaches (post, post, post)."}, {"title": "A crisis in sociology?", "date": "Tuesday, February 17, 2009", "text": "Alvin Gouldner thought there was a \"coming crisis in sociology\" -- but that was almost forty years ago, in 1970 (The Coming Crisis of Western Sociology). And in 1996 Immanuel Wallerstein closed out the century by chairing the Gulbenkian Commission on the Restructuring of the Social Sciences, issuing a report that called for some radical rethinking of the basic assumptions of the social sciences (Open the Social Sciences).Both Gouldner and Wallerstein are pretty good at theorizing about the social world.  So what can we learn from their worries?  Does the twenty-first century demand some new thinking in the ways that we construct the social sciences?I think it does.  If we want to have a more adequate basis for understanding the rapid processes of social change that surround us globally and locally, we need to rethink the concepts and methods we bring to social theory.  And if we want to have a basis for attempting to influence some of these processes through policy, so as to avoid some of the more awful outcomes that they seem to lead to, then we need to be more eclectic in our thinking about social causes and their interactions.What are some of the considerations that lead Gouldner, Wallerstein, and other critics to the conclusion that sociology needs some rethinking?Gouldner's concerns are focused on what he calls the Academic Sociology of the first half of the twentieth century.  The first two-thirds of the book takes the form of a critique of the sociological theories that dominated sociology in the 1940s and 1950s -- theories of social order, structural development, the workings of the social system, functionalism, and the pervasive influence of Talcott Parsons in the middle decades of the century.  So the crisis to which Gouldner refers is really the crisis of functionalist sociology (though he indicates that he thinks that Marxist sociology is heading towards its own crisis as well). It is a sociology that attempts to understand society as a system, that expects social phenomena to be lawlike, and that abstracts almost entirely from history as context or process.Essentially Gouldner's critique is that functionalism implicitly assumes that social systems have reached some kind of optimum in the composition of institutions that govern social life.  Social organizations bring about maximum social utility.  But Gouldner points out that this theoretical mindset makes it inherently difficult to deal with change.  And yet the United States in the 1960s was unmistakeably involved in a process of profound change in its social, economic, and political institutions.  So functionalist sociology was ill-equipped to understand and explain the most basic features of American life in the post-Vietnam War era -- mass protest, racial inequality, extension of the welfare state, urban poverty, and maladaptive political structures.This is roughly the point at which Julia Adams, Elisabeth Stephanie Clemens, and Ann Shola Orloff pick up the story in Remaking Modernity: Politics, History, and Sociology.  And their focus group of beacon social scientists is a promising one -- scholars such as Barrington Moore, Theda Skocpol, Sidney Tarrow, Charles Tilly, or Jack Goldstone, for example.  Adams and her co-editors provide a much more hopeful interpretation of the promise that the methods of historical sociology have for improving our understanding of the society we live in.  The sociology of social movements, conflict, and change replaced the sociology of systems and functional adaptations among the basic institutions of a society; change rather than stasis was the central thread.  And along with this emphasis on change came a sociological spotlight on history.  In fact, one might say that the crisis that Gouldner foresaw was actually resolved by the explosion of research within historical sociology, social mobilization theory, and mid-level studies of historically concrete social institutions and processes.Now what about Wallerstein's worries about contemporary sociology?  Several points are particularly salient.  First, there is a critique of the \"nomothetic\" quest -- the idea that the social sciences should discover social laws. In fact, the commission report observes that this goal is even a bit challenged in the natural sciences when we consider the dynamics of non-linear dynamic systems:Today many natural scientists would argue that the world should be described quite differently. It is a more unstable world, a much more complex world, a world in which perturbations play a big role, one of whose key questions is how to explain how such complexity arises. (62)And social phenomena surely demonstrate this sort of complex non-linearity as well.  So it is unlikely that we will discover robust \"laws of society\" that will serve to explain and predict social outcomes.Second, there is praise for the reunion of social science and history, with social scientists recognizing that the phenomena they study always have a historical context, and with historians recognizing that the social scientists may have uncovered quasi-general processes that can assist them to arrive at explanations of puzzling historical outcomes.  This converges a bit with Gouldner's critique of functionalism.  Referring to a new generation of social scientists, Wallerstein writes:Their criticism of \"mainstream\" social sciences included the assertion that they had neglected the centrality of social change, favoring a mythology of consensus, and that they showed a naive, even arrogant, self-assuredness in applying Western concepts to the analysis of very different phenomena and cultures. (44)Third, Wallerstein notes that many of the large concepts of social science research in the 1960s are deeply questionable -- for example, the concept of modernization as a construct around which to understand the development processes of the post-colonial world.  Much more satisfactory is research along the lines of that of Arturo Escobar, fundamentally questioning the assumptions of progress, development, and modernization that dominated a lot of development thinking in the sixties (Encountering Development).And fourth, Wallerstein and the commission raise pointed questions about the adequacy of disciplinary boundaries in the social sciences, and they emphasize the value of stimulating social research across the boundaries of the various disciplines.So what kind of sociology should we be looking for if we want to understand the big, complex changes that surround us -- big cities, globalization, social networks, terrorism, failing schools, economic transitions, or the transmission of pandemic illness?Here's a possible vision: We should be eclectic in theory and in method.  We should welcome large interdisciplinary collaborations.  We should expect heterogeneity and plasticity in the phenomena we study.  We should pay a lot of attention to historical process and historical context -- not because the past determines the future, but because it constrains it.  We should look carefully for the concrete mechanisms that bring about the social outcomes of interest.  We should be ready to disaggregate large social processes into their components.  And we should be more than ready to settle our gaze on the middle range of phenomena rather than stretching for heroic generalizations that are intended to hold across time, space, and culture.We will need the best social science we can create to handle the challenges of the twenty-first century.  And the shards that remain of positivism, functionalism, and naturalism won't help us to arrive at the innovative intellectual frameworks that will be required.(Here and here are posts on some related methodological disputes in sociology and political science.)"}, {"title": "Scientific misconduct as a principal-agent problem", "date": "Sunday, February 15, 2009", "text": "How does an organization assure that its agents perform their duties truthfully and faithfully? We have ample evidence of the other kind of performance -- theft, misappropriation, lies, fraud, diversion of assets for personal use, and a variety of deceptive accounting schemes. And we have whole professions devoted to detecting and punishing these various forms of dishonesty -- accountants, investigative reporters, management consultants, insurance experts, prosecutors and their investigators. And yet dishonest behavior is common, in business, finance, government, and even the food industry. (See several earlier postings for discussions of the issues of corruption and trust in society.)Here I'm especially interested in a particular kind of activity -- scientific and medical research. Consider a short but sobering list of scientific and medical frauds in the past fifty years: Cyril Burt's intelligence studies, Dr. Hwang Woo-suk's stem cell cloning fraud, the Anjan Kumar Banerjee case in Britain, the MMR vaccine-autism case, a spate of recent cases in China, and numerous other examples.  And consider recent reports that a percentage of scientific photos in leading publications had been photoshopped in ways that favored the researcher's findings (link).  (Here are some comments by Edward Tufte on the issue of scientific imaging, and here are some journal guidelines from the Council of Science Editors attempting to regulate the issue.) Plainly, fraud and misconduct sometimes occur within the institutions of scientific and medical research. And each case has consequences -- for citizens, for patients, and for the future course of research.Here is how the editor of Family Practice describes the problem of research misconduct in a review of Fraud and Misconduct in Medical Research (third edition):Fraud and misconduct are, it seems, endemic in scientific research. Even Galileo, Newton and Mendel appear to have fudged some of their results. From palaeontology to nanotechnology, scientific fraud reappears with alarming regularity. The Office of Research Integrity in the USA investigated 127 serious allegations of scientific fraud last year. The reasons for conducting fraudulent research and misrepresenting research in scientific publications are complex. The pressures to publish and to achieve career progression and promotion and the lure of fame and money may all play a part, but deeper forces often seem to be at work.How important are fraud and misconduct in primary care research? As far as Family Practice goes, mercifully rare, as I pointed out in a recent editorial. Sadly, however, there are examples, all along the continuum from the beginning of a clinical trial to submission of a final manuscript, of dishonesty and deceit in general practice and primary care research. Patients have been invented to increase numbers (and profits) in clinical trials, ethical guidance on consent and confidentiality have been breached, and \u2018salami\u2019 and duplicate publication crop up from time to time.The problem is particularly acute in the area of scientific and medical research because the public at large has very little ability to independently evaluate the validity of a research finding, let alone validate the integrity of the research. And this extends to science and medicine journalists in large part as well, since they are rarely given access to underlying records and data for a study.The stakes are high -- dishonest research can cost lives or delay legitimate research, not to speak of the cost of supporting the fraudulent research in the first place. The temptations for researchers are large as well -- funding from drug and device makers, the incentives and pressures of career advancement, and pure vanity, to name several. And we know that instances of fraud and other forms of serious scientific misconduct continue to occur.So, thinking of this topic as an organizational problem -- what measures can be taken to minimize the incidence of fraud and misconduct in scientific research?One way of describing the situation is as a gigantic principal-agent problem.  (Khalid Abdalla provides a simple explanation of the principal-agent problem here.) It falls within the scope of the more general challenge of motivating, managing, and supervising highly skilled and independent professionals. The \"agent\" is the individual researcher and research team. And the \"principal\" may be construed at a range of levels: society at large, the Federal government, the NIH, the research institute, or the department chair. But it seems likely that the problem is most tractable if we focus attention on the more proximate relationships -- the NIH, the research institute, and the researcher.So this is a good problem to consider from the point of view of institutional design and complex interactive social behavior. We know what kind of behavior we want; the problem is to create the institutional settings and motivational processes through which the desired behavior is encouraged and the undesired behavior is detected and punished.One response from the research institutions (research universities, institutes, and medical schools) is to emphasize training programs in scientific professional ethics, to more deeply instill the values of strict scientific integrity in each researcher and each institution. The hope here is that pervasive attention to the importance of scientific integrity will have the effect of reducing the incidence of misconduct. A second approach, from universities, research organizations, and journals, is to increase oversight and internal controls surrounding scientific fraud. One example -- some journals require that the statistical analysis of results be performed by a qualified, independent, academic statistician. Strict requirements governing conflicts of interest are another institutional response. And a third approach from institutions such as the NIH and NSF is to ratchet up the consequences of misconduct. The United States Office of Research Integrity (link) has a number of training and enforcement programs designed to minimize scientific misconduct. The British government has set up a similar organization to combat research fraud, the UK Research Integrity Office (link). Individuals found culpable will be denied access to research funds -- effectively halting their scientific careers, and criminal prosecution is possible as well. So the sanctions for misconduct are significant. (Here's an egregious example leading to criminal prosecution).And, of course, the first and last line of defense against scientific misconduct is the fundamental requirement of peer review. Scientific journals use expert peers to evaluate the research to be considered for publication, and universities turn to expert peers when they consider scientists for promotion and tenure. Both processes create a strong likelihood of detecting fraud if it exists. Who is better qualified to detect a potentially fraudulent research finding than a researcher in the same field?But is all of this sufficient? It's unclear. The most favorable interpretation would be the judgment that this combination of motivational factors and local and global institutional constraints will contain the problem to an acceptable level. But is there empirical evidence for this optimism?  Or is misconduct becoming more widespread over time?  The efforts to deepen researchers' attachment to a code of research integrity are certainly positive -- but what about the small percentage of people who are not motivated by an internal compass? Greater internal controls are certainly a good idea -- but they are surely less effective in the area of research than accounting controls are in the financial arena. Oversight is just more difficult to achieve in the area of scientific research. (And of course we all know how porous those controls are in the financial sector -- witness Enron and other accounting frauds. ) And if the likelihood of detection is low, then the threat of punishment is weakened.  So the measures mentioned here have serious limitations in likely effectiveness.Brian Deer is one of Britain's leading journalists covering medical research (website).  His work in the Sunday Times of London established the medical fraud underlying the spurious claim that MMR vaccine causes autism mentioned above. Following a recent public lecture to a medical audience he was asked the question, how can we get a handle on frauds like these? And his answer was blunt: with snap inspections, investigative policing, and serious penalties. In his perception, the stakes are too high to leave the matter to professional ethics.It perhaps goes without saying that the vast majority of scientific researchers are honest investigators who are guided by the advancement of science and medicine. But it is also apparent that there are a small number of researchers of whom these statements are not true. And the problem confronting the organizations of scientific research is a hard one: how to create the institutional structures where misconduct is unlikely to occur and where misconduct is most likely to be detected when it does.There is one other connection that strikes me as important, and it is a connection to the philosophy of science. It is an item of faith for philosophers of science that the scientific enterprise is truth-enhancing, in this sense: the community of researchers follows a set of institutionally embodied processes that are well designed to enhancing the comprehensiveness and veridicality of our theories and weeding out the false theories. Our theories get better through the empirical and logical testing that occurs as a result of these socially embodied procedures of science.  But if the corrupting influences mentioned above are indeed common, then the confidence we have in the epistemic value of the procedures of science takes a big hit. And this is worrisome news indeed."}, {"title": "Marx and the Taipings", "date": "Friday, February 13, 2009", "text": "It is interesting to observe how Europe's greatest revolutionary, Karl Marx (1818-1883), thought about China's greatest revolution in the nineteenth century, the Taiping Rebellion (1850-1864).  We might imagine that this relentless advocate for underclass interests might have cheered for the poor peasants of the Taiping Heavenly Army.  But this was not the case.  Marx wrote about the Taiping Rebellion several times in the New York Daily Tribune and other newspapers, and his analysis and his sympathies are fascinating.  His articles are as close to blog postings as one could get in the middle of the nineteenth century; they are topical, opinionated, and pretty revealing about his underlying assumptions.The Taiping rebellion was enormous in every way: perhaps 20 million deaths, armies approaching a million soldiers, sustained Taiping control of large swatches of Chinese territory and cities, and an extended time duration of fighting (about fifteen years).  The American civil war took place during roughly the same time period; and the Taiping rebellion was many times more destructive.  It is a truly fascinating period of world history, and one that had important consequences in the twentieth century.  (Mao and the Chinese Communists largely represented the Taiping rebellion as a proto-communist uprising.)  So how did Marx respond to this social catastrophe?  In a thumbnail -- his observations show a remarkable blindness to a contemporary historical event that seems tailor-made for the framework of his own theories of history and underclass politics.In 1853 Marx wrote a piece for the Daily Tribune called \"Revolution in China and in Europe\" that encapsulates his own understanding of what the Taiping revolution was, and what brought it about.  He lays the largest causal role on the effects of the Opium Wars a decade earlier.  English cannons smashed the appearance of invincible power and authority of the Imperial Chinese state and imposed humiliating conditions on the Chinese nation.  \"Before the British arms the authority of the Manchu dynasty fell to pieces.\"  And, simultaneously, trade and financial penetration by the European powers occurred in ways that were almost fatally deleterious to the Chinese economy and polity.  Forced opium trade led to a rapid depletion of Chinese silver reserves; and the forced availability of English textiles led to severe dislocation for Chinese textile workers.  \"In China the spinners and weavers have suffered greatly under this foreign competition, and the community has become unsettled in proportion.\"Nine years later Marx published another article on the Taiping rebellion, this time in the German newspaper, Die Presse.  The article, \"Chinese Affairs,\" begins with a pretty remarkable bit of Asiatic stereotyping:Some time before the tables began to dance, China--this living fossil--started revolutionizing.  By itself there was nothing extraordinary in this phenomenon, since the Oriental empires always show an unchanging social infra-structure coupled with unceasing change in  the persons and tribes who manage to ascribe to themselves the political super-structure. (442)In this piece he picks up a somewhat different theme from that of the earlier article.  Here he offers an interpretation of the Taiping rebellion against the backdrop of Manchu colonialism: \"Why should there not be initiated, after 300 years, a movement to overthrow it?\"  So the 1853 theory postulates the weakening of the Chinese social order as a chief cause, while the 1862 theory postulates a nationalistic motivation -- a desire of Han people to overthrow Manchu rule.  (An irony here is that the Taiping movement emerged with key support from Hakka people, a cultural minority within the Han population.)The interpretation that Marx offers for the occurrence of a vast rebellion in China, then, is largely an exogenous one: war, trade, and European intrusion led to a total disruption of China's social order; Manchu colonial rule created nationalistic unrest; and rebellion ensued.Marx then goes on to a description of the nature of the rebellion and the rebels.What is original in this Chinese revolution are only its bearers.  They are not conscious of any task, except the change of dynasty. They have no slogans. They are an even greater scourge to the population than the old rulers. It seems that their vocation is nothing else than to set against the conservative disintegration of China, its destruction, in grotesque horrifying form, without any seeds for a renaissance. (443)There are no agents in this description, no social program, and no agenda for change.  Instead, there is only blind violence and destruction.  Marx quotes with evident approval the dispatch of Mr. Bruce, the English Ambassador to Peking, who decries the violence and disorder of the Taiping armies.  And Bruce's central observation is the violence and rapaciousness of the Taiping armies, stealing or destroying all property in the regions they controlled.Notice what Marx's analysis does not do.  It does not identify the class nature of the Taiping movement.  It does not ask what were the social causes that led Chinese peasants to follow the Taiping armies.  And it does not ask what was the social program of the Taiping movement.  The Taipings are represented as a cipher -- just an irrational uprising of millions of passive followers.So whatever happened to the tools of historical analysis that Marx recommended -- the forces and relations of production, the concrete circumstances of class relations, the intimate connection between material conditions of life and political behavior, and the emphasis on exploitation and rebellion?  Why was Marx not disposed to ask the basic questions about the Chinese case: who are these people?  What are the social relations from which they emerge?  And what are they attempting to bring about in their rebellion?  Why, in short, didn't we get something more akin to The Civil War in France, with an effort at a detailed social and political analysis of the uprising?It is hard to escape the answer to this question: it is Eurocentrism in the extreme, and a consequent inability to see the implications of his own categories of analysis for this otherwise intriguing case.  This isn't exactly news, of course.  But it does underline the importance for today's historians of finding ways of treating world history without imposing the categories of European experience. A China-centered analysis of the Taiping rebellion has a very different look from the sketch we find in Marx's descriptions.  (See an earlier posting on historical comparisons for more on this point.)There is a great deal of very good contemporary historical research on the Taiping rebellion.  Here are a handful of good contemporary treatments:Cole, James H. 1981. The People Versus the Taipings: Bao Lisheng's Righteous Army of Dongan.

Berkeley: Institute of East Asian Studies, Univ. of Calif.These histories bring out many different aspects of the Taiping story, and they don't all agree.  They also bring out an element that is entirely missing in Marx's comments -- the influence of Christian missionaries on the formation of Taiping ideology.  But what they all agree on is that the Taiping movement was socially complex, with a strong ideology, a very specific set of demands about property and social institutions, and pretty complex military relations.  And they certainly agree that the relationship between Manchu rule, European colonialism, and internal social factors is far more complex than Marx's story allows.Both articles discussed here (as well as a large number of postings on India) are included in Karl Marx on Colonialism & Modernization: His Despatches And Other Writings on China, India, Mexico, the Middle East and North Africa, a volume edited and introduced by Shlomo Avineri."}, {"title": "What is a norm?", "date": "Thursday, February 12, 2009", "text": "The role of norms in social behavior is a key question for sociology.  Is a norm a sociological reality?  And do individuals behave in conformance to norms?We can offer mundane examples of social norms deriving from a wide range of social situations: norms of politeness, norms of fairness, norms of appropriate dress, norms of behavior in business meetings, norms of gendered behavior, and norms of body language and tone of voice in police work.  In each case we suppose that (a) there is a publicly recognized norm governing the specified conduct within a specific social group, (b) the norm influences individual behavior in some way, and (c) sanctions and internal motivations come into the explanation of conformant behavior.  Norm-breakers may come in for rough treatment by the people around them -- which may induce them to honor the norm in the future.  And norm-conformers may do so because they have internalized a set of inhibitions about the proscribed behavior.Here are a number of key empirical and conceptual questions that are raised by norms.What is a norm?How are social norms embodied in behavior and structure?How do individuals internalize norms?How do norms influence behavior?Why do individuals conform their behavior to a set of local norms?What factors stabilize a norm system over time?What social factors influence change in a norm system?Before we can go much further into this issue, we need to have a fairly clear idea of what we mean by a norm. We might define a norm as --a socially embodied and individually perceived imperative that such-and-so an action must be performed in such-and-so a fashion. We can then separate out several other types of questions: First, what induces individuals to conform to the imperative? How do individuals come to have the psychological dispositions to conform to the norm? Second, how is the norm embodied in social relations and behavior?  And third, what are the social mechanisms or processes that created the imperative within the given social group? What mechanisms serve to sustain it over time?To the first question, there seem to be only three possible answers -- and each is in fact socially and psychologically possible. The imperative may be internalized into the motivational space of the individual, so he/she chooses to act according to the imperative (or is habituated to acting in such a way). There may be an effective and well-know system of sanctions that attach to violations of the norms, so the individual has an incentive to comply. These sanctions may be formal or informal. The sanction may be as benign as being laughed at for wearing a hawaiian shirt to a black tie ball (I'll never do that again!), or as severe as being beaten for seeming gay in a cowboy bar.  Or, third, there may be benefits from conformance that make conformance a choice that is in the actor's rational self-interest. (Every time one demonstrates that he/she can choose the right fork for dessert, the likelihood of being invited to another formal dinner increases.)  Each of these would make sense of the fact that an individual conforms his/her behavior to the requirements of a norm and helps to answer the question, why do individuals conform to norms?The questions about the social embodiment of a norm are the most difficult.  Does the embodiment of a given norm consist simply in the fact that a certain percentage of people in fact behave in accordance with the rule -- for whatever reason?  Does the norm exist in virtue of the fact that people consciously champion the norm and impose sanctions on violators?  Might we imagine that human beings are normative animals and absorb normative systems in the way that we absorb grammatical systems -- by observing and inferring about the behavior of others?As for the third cluster of questions about genesis and persistence, there is a range of possibilities here as well. The system may have been designed by one or more deliberate actors. It may have emerged through a fairly random process that is guided by positive social feedback of some sort. It may be the resultant of multiple groups advocating for one set of norms or another to govern a given situation of conflict and/or cooperation. And, conceivably, it may be the result of something analogous to natural selection across small groups: the groups with a more efficient set of norms may out-perform competing groups.For example, how should we explain the emergence and persistence of a particular set of norms of marriage and reproduction in a given society?  Is it causally relevant to observe that \"this set of norms results in a rate of fertility that matches the rate of growth of output\"?  How would this functionally desirable fact play a causal role in the emergence and persistence of this set of norms?  Is there any sort of feedback process that we can hypothesize between \"norms at time T\", \"material results of behavior governed by these norms at T+1\", and \"persistence/change of norms at time T+2\"?  The business practices of a company are consciously adjusted over time to bring about better overall performance; but what about spontaneously occurring sets of social norms?  How do these change over time?  Do individuals or groups have the ability to deliberately modify the norms that govern their everyday activities?It seems inescapable that norms of behavior exist in a society and that individuals adjust their behavior out of regard for relevant norms.  The microfoundations of how this works is obscure, however, in that we don't really have good answers to the parallel questions: how do individuals internalize norms? And how do informal practices of norm enforcement work? And what social-causal factors play a role in the emergence, persistence, and change of a system of norms at a given time?(The photo of the ice rink at Rockefeller Center is intended to evoke several observations about social norms: the facts that the skaters are largely moving in a counter-clockwise direction, no one is carrying a hockey stick, and there are many children present all reflect one aspect or another of the norms governing skating in public arenas.)"}, {"title": "Analyzing peasant consciousness", "date": "Tuesday, February 10, 2009", "text": "painting: Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Millet, The Gleaners (1857)painting: Edward H. Corbould, Hetty and Captain Donnithorne in Mrs. Poyser's DairyJames Scott is a scholar who has shed more light on the mentality and agency of rural people than almost any other since the reinvigoration of peasant studies in the 1970s.  Scott's book The Moral Economy of the Peasant: Rebellion and Subsistence in Southeast Asia (1976) tried to understand peasant political behavior in southeast Asia through the lens of the norms of justice that were embodied in traditional village societies.  His Weapons of the Weak: Everyday Forms of Peasant Resistance (1987) further advanced his theorizing about the subjective side of class relations\u2014the experience of subordination and the cultural vocabulary in terms of which subordination is lived in particular social circumstances.  Here I'd like to reflect on one of his books that is less empirical but no less insightful into the consciousness of the subordinates -- Domination and the Arts of Resistance: Hidden Transcripts (1992). This is a book about the experience of domination and indignity that power relations impose upon the powerless. As such it is an important step forward in James Scott\u2019s efforts to provide a language in terms of which to understand underclass politics.  Scott takes a big step forward here in helping us find a vocabulary and a more of representation for understanding the mentality of peasants, serfs, and other subalterns.  How do they understand their social world?  Scott offers a strikingly different interpretation of the social knowledge of the subordinate.Scott\u2019s central innovation in this work is his distinction between public transcripts (\u201cthe open interaction between subordinates and those who dominate;\u201d p. 2) and hidden transcripts (\u201cdiscourse that takes place \u2018offstage,\u2019 beyond direct observation by powerholders;\u201d p. 4).  Scott observes that there is a sharp divide between the behavior, language, and customs that dominated groups assume in public, and the language, jokes, and criticisms that structure their lives within the back streets, slave quarters, or rice paddies of their within-group experience.Both public transcripts and hidden transcripts have effects on the everyday politics of power.  The public transcript is a conventional pattern of speech for the dominated, a stylized public performance through which they adopt the forms of deference and respect for the powerful that are needed to avoid conflict with the powerful.  But Scott maintains that this performance is only skin-deep. The dominated are by no means taken in by their own affirmations of the justice and good manners of their masters, and behind the scenes we may expect to hear much raucous laughing, merciless lampooning, and bitter criticism.Offstage, where subordinates may gather outside the intimidating gaze of power, a sharply dissonant political culture is possible.  Slaves in the relative safety of their quarters can speak the words of anger, revenge, self\u2011 assertion that they must normally choke back when in the presence of the masters and mistresses. (p. 18)  Scott aims to shed light on this hidden transcript, with the idea that an understanding of this level of consciousness of the dominated is much closer to the reality of their lived experience and provides a better basis for understanding their political behavior.In addition to a varied set of empirical and historical sources, Scott also makes genuinely innovative use of literary works to better understand the hidden transcript.  Scott has identified dozens of texts\u2014works by George Eliot, George Orwell, Euripedes, Brer Rabbit, Milan Kundera, Jean Genet, Emile Zola, and many others\u2014in which the divide between the public and hidden transcripts is directly at issue in the novel.  These sources have evidentiary value; for example, Scott writes of George Eliot, \u201cSuch were Eliot\u2019s powers of observation and insight into her rural society that many of the key issues of domination and resistance can be teased from her story of Mrs. Poyser\u2019s encounter with the squire\u201d (p. 7).  But more important is their interpretive value.  They permit Scott to communicate to the reader a vivid understanding of the way the hidden transcript works.Scott\u2019s contention that the hidden transcript is an open-eyed appraisal of existing relations of domination inevitably comes into conflict with theories of ideology and hegemony.  Classical Marxist or Gramscian ideas about ideology suggest that dominated groups come to share the values and perceptions of the dominant group.  Scott argues that what is taken as hegemony of dominant-group ideas is in fact often only an uncritical observation of the performance of the public transcript.  Rather, he suggests that the dominated are perfectly capable of formulat\u00ading their own criticisms of the social relations in which they find themselves. \u201cA combination of adaptive strategic behavior and the dialogue implicit in most power relations ensures that public action will provide a constant stream of evidence that appears to support an interpretation of ideological hegemony\u201d (p. 70).  This interpretation gives a much greater degree of agency and knowledge to the dominated.Scott is one of the relatively few social scientists of the past forty years who have consistently offered us new concepts and frameworks in terms of which to understand the social reality we confront.  \"Moral economy,\" \"weapons of the weak,\" and \"hidden transcripts\" are all conceptual innovations that have significantly altered the ways we have for understanding and analyzing the social realities associated with domination and resistance.  And this is a very important contribution to the intellectual challenge of describing and explaining these complex social realities.(Scott's most recent book, Seeing Like a State: How Certain Schemes to Improve the Human Condition Have Failed (1999), is also a tour-de-force; more on that in a subsequent posting.)"}, {"title": "Institutions, procedures, norms", "date": "Monday, February 9, 2009", "text": "One of the noteworthy aspects of the framing offered by Victor Nee and Mary Brinton of the assumptions of the new institutionalism is the very close connection they postulate between institutions and norms. (See the prior posting on this subject).  So what is the connection between institutions and norms?The idea that an institution is nothing more than a collections of norms, formal and informal, seems incomplete on its face.  Institutions also depend on rules, procedures, protocols, sanctions, and habits and practices. These other social behavioral factors perhaps intersect in various ways with the workings of social norms, but they are not reducible to a set of norms. And  this is to say that institutions are not reducible to a collection of norms.Consider for example the institutions that embody the patient safety regime in a hospital.  What are the constituents of the institutions through which hospitals provide for patient safety?  Certainly there are norms, both formal and informal, that are deliberately inculcated and reinforced and that influence the behavior of nurses, pharmacists, technicians, and doctors. But there are also procedures -- checklists in operating rooms; training programs -- rehearsals of complex crisis activities; routinized behaviors -- \"always confirm the patient's birthday before initiating a procedure\"; and rules -- \"physicians must disclose financial relationships with suppliers\".  So the institutions defining the management of patient safety are a heterogeneous mix of social factors and processes. A key feature of an institution, then, is the set of procedures and protocols that it embodies.  In fact, we might consider a short-hand way of specifying an institution in terms of the set of procedures it specifies for behavior in stereotyped circumstances of crisis, conflict, cooperation, and mundane interactions with stakeholders.   Organizations have usually created specific ways of handling typical situations: handling an intoxicated customer in a restaurant, making sure that no \"wrong site\" surgeries occur in an operating room, handling the flow of emergency supplies into a region when a large disaster occurs.  The idea here is that the performance of the organization, and the individuals within it, will be more effective at achieving the desired goals of the organization if plans and procedures have been developed to coordinate actions in the most effective way possible.  This is the purpose of an airline pilot's checklist before takeoff; it forces the pilot to go through a complete procedure that has been developed for the purpose of avoiding mistakes.  Spontaneous, improvised action is sometimes unavoidable; but organizations have learned that they are more effective when they thoughtfully develop procedures for handling their high-risk activities.This is the point at which the categories of management oversight and staff training come into play.  It is one thing to have designed an effective set of procedures for handling a given complex task; but this achievement is only genuinely effective if agents within the organization in fact follow the procedures and protocols.  Training is the umbrella activity that describes the processes through which the organization attempts to achieve a high level of shared knowledge about the organization's procedures.  And management oversight is the umbrella activity that describes the processes of supervision and motivation through which the organization attempts to ensure that its agents follow the procedures and protocols.In fact, one of the central findings in the area of safety research is that the specific content of the procedures of an organization that engages in high-risk activities is crucially important to the overall safety performance of the organization.  Apparently small differences in procedure can have an important effect on safety.  To take a fairly trivial example, the construction of a stylized vocabulary and syntax for air traffic controllers and pilots increases safety by reducing the possibility of ambiguous communications; so two air traffic systems that were identical except with respect to the issue of standardized communications protocols will be expected to have different safety records.  Another key finding falls more on the \"norms and culture\" side of the equation; it is frequently observed that high-risk organizations need to embody a culture of safety that permeates the whole organization.We might postulate that norms come into the story when we get to the point of asking what motivates a person to conform to the prescribed procedure or rule -- though there are several other social-behavioral mechanisms that work at this level as well (trained habits, well enforced sanctions, for example). But more fundamentally, the explanatory value of the micro-institutional analysis may come in at the level of the details of the procedures and rules in contrast to other possible embodiments -- rather than at the level of the question, what makes these procedures effective in most participants' conduct?We might say, then, that an institution can be fully specified when we provide information about:the procedures, policies, and protocols it imposes on its participantsthe training and educational processes the institution relies on for instilling appropriate knowledge about its procedures and rules in its participantsthe management, supervision, enforcement, and incentive mechanisms it embodies to assure a sufficient level of compliance among its participantsthe norms of behavior that typical participants have internalized with respect to action within the institutionAnd the distinctive performance characteristics of the institution may derive from the specific nature of the arrangements that are described at each of these levels.System safety is a good example to consider from the point of view of the new institutionalism. Two airlines may have significantly different safety records. And the explanation may be at any of these levels: they may have differences in formalized procedures, they may have differences in training regimes, they may have differences in management oversight effectiveness, or they may have different normative cultures at the rank-and-file level. It is a central insight of the new institutionalism that the first level may be the most important for explaining the overall safety records of the two companies, even though mechanisms may fail at any of the other levels as well. Procedural differences generally lead to significant and measurable differences in the quality of organizational results. (Nancy Leveson's Safeware: System Safety and Computers provides a great discussion of many of these issues.)"}, {"title": "The new institutionalism", "date": "Saturday, February 7, 2009", "text": "The new institutionalism in sociology is a particularly promising prism through which to understand a lot of social behavior and change.  Victor Nee and Paul Ingram define the approach in these terms in \"Embeddedness and Beyond\" in The New Institutionalism in Sociology:Specifying the mechanisms through which institutions shape the parameters of choice is important to an adequate sociological understanding of economic action.  These social mechanisms, we argue, involve processes that are built into ongoing social relationships -- the domain of network analysis in sociology.  Yet, how institutions and networks combine to determine economic and organizational performance is inadequately theorized in the sociological study of economic life.An institution is a web of interrelated norms -- formal and informal -- governing social relationships.  It is by structuring social interactions that institutions produce group performance, in such primary groups as families and work units as well as in social units as large as organizations and even entire economies.  (Nee and Ingram, p. 19)The new institutional economics is essentially a marriage of the familiar assumptions of rational choice theory with the observation that \u201cinstitutions matter\u201d\u2014that is, that the behavior of purposive individuals depends critically on the institutional constraints within which they act, and the institutional constraints themselves are under-determined by material and economic circumstances. So institutions evolve in response to the strategic actions of a field of actors. The paragraphs quoted above make it clear that the approach stipulates a very tight relationship between institutions and norms regulating behavior.   The approach pays close attention to the importance of transaction costs in economic activity (the costs of supervision of a work force, for example, or the cost of collecting information on compliance with a contract). And it postulates that institutions emerge and persist as a solution to specific problems of social coordination.Topics of central concern to the practitioners of the new institutionalism include principal-agent problems (the costs of assuring that one\u2019s agents are performing their functions according to the interests of the principal); the design of alternative systems of property rights; collective action problems; and mechanisms of collective decision-making. In each instance the analysis is designed to illuminate the ways in which institutional arrangements have been selected (or have evolved) in such ways as to respond to an important element of transaction costs. It bears pointing out that this approach does not assume that \u201coptimal\u201d institutions emerge, since the actual institutions selected depend on the distribution of political power across groups and their antecedent interests. This point is richly born out in Robert Bates\u2019s important arguments concerning government agricultural policies in other parts of Africa (Markets and States in Tropical Africa: The Political Basis of Agricultural Policies) and also in Jack Knight's efforts to frame the conflictual elements of institutions (Institutions and Social Conflict).Here is a striking example of a new-institutionalist analysis of a concrete sociological phenomenon: Jean Ensminger's account of bridewealth in the cattle-herding culture of Kenya (Making a Market: The Institutional Transformation of an African Society).  First, some background.  The cattle-herding economic regime of the Orma pastoralists of Kenya underwent substantial changes in the 1970s and 1980s.  Commons grazing practices began to give way to restricted pasturage; wage labor among herders came to replace familial and patron-client relations; and a whole series of changes in the property system surrounding the cattle economy transpired as well.  This is an excellent example for empirical study from a new-institutionalist perspective.  What explained the particular configuration of norms and institutions of the earlier period?  And what social pressures led to the transition towards a more impersonal relationship between owners and herders?Ensminger examines these questions from the perspective of the new institutionalism.  Building on the theoretical frameworks of Douglass North  and others, she undertakes to provide an analysis of the workings of traditional Orma cattle-management practices and an explanation of the process of change and dissolution that these practices underwent in the decades following 1960.  The book puts forward a combination of close ethnographic detail and sophisticated use of theoretical ideas to explain complex local phenomena.How does the new institutionalism approach help to explain the features of the traditional Orma cattle regime identified by Ensminger\u2019s study? The key institutions in the earlier period are the terms of employment of cattle herders in mobile cattle camps.  The traditional employment practice takes the pattern of an embroidered patron-client relation.  The cattle owner provides a basic wage contract to the herder (food, clothing, and one head of cattle per year).  The good herder is treated paternally, with additional \u201cgifts\u201d at the end of the season (additional clothing, an additional animal, and payment of the herder\u2019s bridewealth after years of service).  The relation between patron and client is multi-stranded, enduring, and paternal.Ensminger understands this traditional practice as a solution to an obvious principal-agent problem associated with mobile cattle camps.  Supervision costs are very high, since the owner does not travel with the camp.  The owner must depend on the herder to use his skill and diligence in a variety of difficult circumstances\u2014rescuing stranded cattle, searching out lost animals, and maintaining control of the herd during harsh conditions.  There are obvious short-term incentives and opportunities for the herder to cheat the employer\u2014e.g. allowing stranded animals to perish, giving up on searches for lost animals, or even selling animals during times of distress.  The patron-client relation gives the herder a long-term incentive to provide high-quality labor, for the quality of work can be assessed at the end of the season by assessment of the health and size of the herd.  The patron has an incentive to cheat the client\u2014e.g. by refusing to pay the herder\u2019s bridewealth after years of service.  But here the patron\u2019s interest in reputation comes into play: a cattle owner with a reputation for cheating his clients will find it difficult to recruit high-quality herders.This account serves to explain the evolution and persistence of the patron-client relation in cattle-camps on the basis of transaction costs (costs of supervision).  Arrangements will be selected that serve to minimize transaction costs.  In the circumstances of traditional cattle-rearing among the Orma the transaction costs of a straight wage-labor system are substantially greater than those associated with a patron-client system.  Therefore the patron-client system is selected.This framework would also suggest that if transaction costs change substantially (through improved transportation, for example, or through the creation of fixed grazing areas), that the terms of employment would change as well (in the direction of less costly pure wage-labor contracts).  And in fact this is what Ensminger finds among the Orma.  When villages begin to establish \u201crestricted grazing areas\u201d in the environs of the village, it is feasible for cattle owners to directly supervise the management of their herds; and in these circumstances Ensminger finds an increase in pure wage labor contracts.New institutionalism is a particularly appealing sociological framework from the point of view of the philosophy of society involved here because it asks the right sorts of questions at the right level.  The level of analysis is fairly close to the ground -- fairly proximate to the actions of socially embedded agents.  And the questions that are posed are key: what social problems is a given set of institutions solving?  How do these institutions relate to the purposive actions of individuals?  And what are the social mechanisms that stabilize or destabilize a given institutional configuration at a certain point in time?"}, {"title": "Norms and deliberative rationality", "date": "Wednesday, February 4, 2009", "text": "Why do people cooperate?  That is, what motivates individuals to come together to share labor and resources in pursuit of a common good from which they cannot be excluded -- fighting fires, hunting marauding tigers, cleaning up a public beach?  Standard rational choice theory, and its application to problems of individual rationality in group settings, implies that cooperation should be unstable in the face of free-riding.  This was Mancur Olson's central conclusion in his classic book The Logic of Collective Action: Public Goods and the Theory of Groups.   Roughly, his conclusion was that cooperation would be possible only if there were excludable side benefits for participants, selective coercion to enforce cooperation, or privatization of the gains of collective action.  Otherwise, it is prisoners' dilemmas all the way down.  However, we know from many social contexts that individuals do in fact succeed in establishing cooperative relationships without any of these supporting conditions.  So what are we missing when we consider social action from the narrow perspective of rational choice theory?A part of the answer to this puzzle involves the role of norms in action.  Here the criticism is that the rational-choice approach, by attending solely to calculations of self-interest, is blind to the workings of normative frameworks; but in fact norms are powerful factors underlying behavior in most traditional contexts.  This perspective finds expression in the moral economy literature within peasant studies -- e.g. James Scott's The Moral Economy of the Peasant: Rebellion and Subsistence in Southeast Asia.  (This debate is sometimes referred to as one between formalists and substantivists.  Karl Polanyi is another good example of the substantivist perspective (The Great Transformation), while Sam Popkin (The Rational Peasant: The Political Economy of Rural Society in Vietnam) and Theodore Schultz (Transforming Traditional Agriculture) fall on the side of the formalists.)According to the substantivist perspective, traditional societies are communities: tightly cohesive groups of persons sharing a distinctive set of values in stable, continuing relations to one another (Michael Taylor Community, Anarchy and Liberty).  The central threats to security and welfare are well-known to such groups--excessive or deficient rainfall, attacks by bandits, predatory tax policies by the central government, etc.  And village societies have evolved schemes of shared values and cooperative practices and institutions which are well-adapted to handling these problems of risk and welfare in ways which protect the subsistence needs of all villagers adequately in all but the most extreme circumstances.  The substantivists thus maintain that traditions and norms are fundamental social factors, and that individual behavior is almost always modulated through powerful traditional motivational constraints.  One consequence of this modulation is that many societies do not display a sharp distinction between group interest and individual interest that is predicted by collective action theory.  (An important theoretical defense of this conclusion can be found in the work of Elinor Ostrom and her fellow researchers in their treatment of \"common property resource regimes\"; see Governing the Commons: The Evolution of Institutions for Collective Action.)There are, of course, well-known social and behavioral processes that may tend to undermine the working of a given set of norms.  Normative systems are inherently ambiguous and subject to revision over time. Consequently we should expect that opportunistic agents will find ways of adapting given social norms more comfortably to the pursuit of self-interest.  Consider the requirement that elites should provide for the subsistence needs of the poor in times of dearth.  There are some grounds for supposing that such a requirement is in the longterm interest of elites--for example, by promoting social stability and establishing bonds of reciprocity with other members of an interdependent society.  But it seems reasonable to expect that elites--already by their superior economic position able to exercise political and social power as well--will find ways of limiting the effect of such norms on their behavior.  So it is insufficient to simply postulate a set of governing norms; we need to identify the mechanisms at the group and individual levels that make them behaviorally relevant and stable.  But, significantly, some theorists have tried to show that rational self-interest may actually reinforce certain kinds of norms of fairness and reciprocity; thus Robert Axelrod's analysis of the dynamics of reciprocity demonstrates that cooperation is rational in relation to a variety of circumstances of face-to-face cooperation in The Evolution of Cooperation: Revised Edition.These points notwithstanding, there remains a credible line of criticism of the rational-choice paradigm based on the role of norms in behavior.   For it is clear that individuals pay some attention to normative constraints within the process of rational deliberation.  The model of simple maximizing decision-making is overly abstract; instead, we need to have a conception of rational action that permits us to incorporate some consideration of normative requirements as well as purposes and goals.  We need a broader conception of practical rationality that incorporates both means-end rationality and normative deliberation; we need a theory that embraces both Mill and Aristotle.A number of social scientists have taken this point seriously.  Particularly profound is the critique of pure rational choice theory offered by Amartya Sen in an essay called \"Rational Fools\" (jstor link; and here is the introduction to a recent symposium on the article in Economics and Philosophy).  Sen criticizes the assumption of pure self-interest which is contained in the standard conception.   Against the assumption of self-interested maximizing decision-making, Sen argues for a proposal for a more structured concept of practical reason: one which permits the decision-maker to take account of commitments.  This concept covers a variety of non-welfare features of reasoning, but moral principle (fairness and reciprocity) and altruistic concern for the welfare of others are central among these.  Sen believes that the role of commitment is centrally important in the analysis of individuals' behavior with regard to public goods, and he draws connections between the role of commitment and work motivation.  He argues, therefore, that in order to understand different areas of rational behavior it is necessary to consider both utility-maximizing decision-making and rational conduct influenced by commitment; and it is an empirical question whether one factor or the other is predominant in a particular range of behavior.  Thus Sen holds that an adequate theory of rationality requires more structure than a simple utility-maximizing model would allow; in particular, it needs to take account of moral norms and commitments.These arguments are telling; the model of narrow economic rationality makes overly restrictive assumptions about the role of norms in rational behavior.  Human behavior is the resultant of several different forms of motive--self-interest, fairness, and altruism; and several different types of decision-making processes--maximizing and deliberation. A more adequate model of broadened practical rationality therefore needs to incorporate a decision rule that represents the workings of moral constraints and commitments as well as goal-directed calculation.  This rule should reduce to the familiar utility  maximizing rule in circumstances in which moral constraints are not prominent --  e.g., in decision-making within a market.  But in situations where important norms of behavior are in play, we need to try to reproduce the more complex deliberation processes that real human decision-makers undergo in order to combine their normative commitments and their goals and preferences.This is not a small problem, however; for one of the chief merits of the paradigm of narrow economic rationality is its parsimony--the fact that it reduces rational choice to a single dimension of deliberation.  Once we require that rational choice theory needs to take normative constraints and commitments into account as well as interests, it is much more difficult to provide formal models of rational choice.  However, some progress has been made on this problem.  For example, Howard Margolis (Selfishness, Altruism, and Rationality) attempts to formalize represent rational deliberation in the presence of public goods as the result of two utility functions, one representing the individual's private interests and the other the individual's appraisal of the public good; the two functions are then aggregated by a higher order decision rule.  (John Harsanyi makes similar arguments.)This broadening of the conception of individual rationality has important implications.  For example, consider public goods problems.  Once we consider a more complex theory of practical deliberation, formal arguments concerning freeriding problems in real social groups will be indeterminate.  On a more complex, and more empirically adequate, account of practical reason, conditional altruism, cooperation, and reciprocity may be deliberatively rational choices; therefore we would expect a social group consisting of rational individuals to show signs of cooperation and conditional altruism. And the challenge for sociology is to identify the mechanisms of individual deliberation and social reinforcement that serve to stabilize the system of norms and the behaviors that conform to them.  This is one of the tasks that the field of new institutionalism has taken on (Mary Brinton and Victor Nee, eds., The New Institutionalism in Sociology)."}, {"title": "Modernism and social life", "date": "Saturday, January 31, 2009", "text": "painting: Georges Braque, Woman with a Guitar (1913)Image: Mexico City slumModernity is remarkably hard to define or capture. We might try this ostensive definition: it is the culture, mental framework, and social reality of the world created by the industrial revolution, mass society, urban life, and mass literacy and communication. It is the world of anonymous social relations, the market as a central social reality, the rational-bureaucratic state, and mass public opinion.  It is what came after \"the world we have lost\" (Peter Laslett's evocative phrase in The World We Have Lost: England Before the Industrial Age) -- the pre-modern world of direct, face-to-face social relations, powerful religious beliefs, traditional regulation of village society, and very low levels of mobility for the individual.  Stability, continuity, locality, and legible social relations capture the pre-modern world.  And the modern world overturns each of these.English critic (and blogger before his time) Thomas Carlyle saw it coming -- and he didn't care for it.  Here are some of his descriptions of the social reality coming to England in the 1820s in Past and Present:The condition of England, on which many pamphlets are now in the course of publication, and many thoughts unpublished are going on in every reflective head, is justly regarded as one of the most ominous, and withal one of the strangest ever seen in this world.  England is full of wealth, of multifarious produce, supply for human want in every kind; yet England is dying of inanition.  With unabated bounty the land of England blooms and grows; waving with yellow harvests; thick-studded with work-shops, industrial implements, with fifteen millions of workers, understood to be the strongest, the cunningest, and the willingest our Earth ever had ... and behold, some baleful fiat as of Enchantment has gone forth, saying, \"Touch it not, ye workers, ye master-workers, ye master-idlers; none of you can touch it, no man of you shall be the better for it; this is enchanted fruit!\" (Book I, ch. 1)But, it is said, our religion is gone: we no longer believe in St. Edmund, no longer see the figure of him \"on the rim of the sky,\" minatory or confirmatory? God's absolute Laws, sanctioned by an eternal Heaven and an eternal Hell, have become Moral Philosophies, sanctioned by able computations of Profit and Loss, by weak considerations of Pleasures of Virtue and the Moral Sublime. (Book III, ch. 1)And in fact, I think the task of making sense of a rapidly changing social reality was as stunning in the 1840s as it is today -- Karl Marx, Thomas Carlyle, Alexander Herzen, Friedrich Engels, and Mikhail Bakunin all turned their imaginations and their critical abilities to the task of conceptualizing the changes that were sweeping across Europe and the globe in the first part of the nineteenth century.  (Steven Marcus does a good job of capturing the cognitive and imaginative challenge faced by reflective observers in the early nineteenth century in Engels, Manchester, and the Working Class.)So how can sociologists, historians, or artists and poets help us understand the nature of modernity?  The cacophony of the modern city is one powerful metaphor for the nature of the social modern.  So the sociology of the city is a good place to start.  And the jangled, fractured canvases of modernist painting evoke the conflicting, overlapping mentalities of the modern world; so perhaps we can learn something about the nature of modernity from reflective art historians.Here is how art historian T. J. Clark reflects on the meaning of \"modernity\" in his spectacular book, Farewell to an Idea: Episodes from a History of Modernism.\"Modernity\" means contingency. It points to a social order which has turned from the worship of ancestors and past authorities to the pursuit of a projected future -- of goods, pleasures, freedoms, forms of control over nature, or infinities of information.  This process goes along with a great emptying and sanitizing of the imagination.  Without ancestor-worship, meaning is in short supply -- \"meaning\" here meaning agreed-on and instituted forms of value and understanding, implicit orders, stories and images in which a culture crystallizes its sense of the struggle with the realm of necessity and the reality of pain and death. The phrase Max Weber borrowed from Schiller, \"the disenchantment of the world,\" still seems to me to sum up this side of modernity best. (7)\"Secularization\" is a nice technical word for this blankness.  It means specialization and abstraction; social life driven by a calculus of large-scale statistical chances, with everyone accepting (or resenting) a high level of risk; time and space turned into variables in that same calculus, both of them saturated by \"information\" and played with endlessly, monotonously, on nets and screens; the de-skilling of everyday life (deference to experts and technicians in more of the microstructure of the self); available, invasive, haunting expertise; the chronic revision of everything in the light of \"studies.\" I should say straightaway that this cluster of features seems to be tied to, and propelled by, one central process: the accumulation of capital, and the spread of capitalist markets into more and more of the world and the texture of human dealings. (7)Is it not the case that the truly new, and disorienting, character of modernity is its seemingly being driven by merely material, statistical, tendential, \"economic\" considerations? We know we are living a new form of life, in which all previous notions of belief and sociability have been scrambled.  And the true terror of this new order has to do with its being ruled -- and obscurely felt to be ruled -- by sheer concatenation of profit and loss, bids and bargains: that is, by a system without any focusing purpose to it, or any compelling image or ritualization of that purpose. It is the blindness of modernity that seems to me fundamental, and to which modernism is a response. (8)painting: Pablo Picasso, The Poet (1911)And what about the city?  How does the sociology of the city shed light on the cultural reality of the modern world?  The modern city represented a coming-together of many of the currents of social change that constituted the heterogeneous mix of \"modernity.\"  A large and disconnected population, substantial inequalities, civic anonymity, alienation, bureaucratic administration, modern policing and public services, street cars, and a virtual absence of overarching social solidarity conjoined to create a jangled social configuration with the angular properties of a modernist portrait.An earlier posting focused on Engels's sociology of the city.  But here is how Georg Simmel puts it in \"The Metropolis and Modern Life\":The deepest problems of modern life flow from the attempt of the individual to maintain the independence and individuality of his existence against the sovereign powers of society, against the weight of the historical heritage and the external culture and technique of life. This antagonism represents the most modern form of the conflict which primitive man must carry on with nature for his own bodily existence. The eighteenth century may have called for liberation from all the ties which grew up historically in politics, in religion, in morality and in economics in order to permit the original natural virtue of man, which is equal in everyone, to develop without inhibition; the nineteenth century may have sought to promote, in addition to man's freedom, his individuality (which is connected with the division of labour) and his achievements which make him unique and indispensable but which at the same time make him so much the more dependent on the complementary activity of others; Nietzsche may have seen the relentless struggle of the individual as the prerequisite for his full development, while socialism found the same thing in the suppression of all competition -- but in each of these the same fundamental motive was at work, namely the resistance of the individual to being leveled, swallowed up in the social-technological mechanism.  The Chicago School of sociology is particularly on target when it comes to understanding \"modernity\", given its strong emphasis on understanding the social reality of Chicago as a turbulent, jangled social reality.(See Julia Adams, Elisabeth S. Clemens and Ann Shola Orloff, eds., Remaking Modernity: Politics, History, and Sociology (Politics, History, and Culture), for some very thoughtful discussions of the study of \"modernity\" by contemporary historical sociologists.)"}, {"title": "France as a \"nation\"", "date": "Wednesday, January 28, 2009", "text": "source: Emmanuel Todd, The Making of Modern France: Politics, Ideology and Culture (Blackwell, 1991)Is France one nation?  What makes it so?  And what are the large socio-cultural factors that led to modern France?  These are the questions that Emmanuel Todd raises in The Making of Modern France: Ideology, Politics and Culture.  Todd is one of this generation's leading historians in France, and his conception of the challenge of history is worth studying.  I would call him a \"macro-historian\", in that he is interested in large processes of change over extended stretches of space (for example, the extension of industry across the map of France from 1850 to 1970, or the patterns of religious dissent from the twelfth to the twentieth centuries), and he singles out characteristics of family structure, demography, literacy, and religion as a set of causal factors that explain the patterns of historical change that he uncovers.Todd's starting point seems exactly right to me: the \"nation\" is not a particularly salient level of analysis for making sense of large historical change.  Social, economic, and political developments should not be presumed to unfold at the level of the nation.  He puts forward a simple but apt criterion for choosing a level of analysis for historical inquiry: \"one has to observe the social and economic behaviour of the human beings in question and discover their scale in order to define closed and homogeneous groups which then can be called society X or economy Y\" (7).  And in fact, he argues that \"France\" is better understood as a configuration of regions and zones than as an integrated national system.  As he puts the point, \"one can represent France as a heterogeneous and open area in which social, economic and political forces emerge, spread and establish themselves quite independently of the central power and of the overall national structure\" (8).   And: \"Notions of 'French society', 'French economy', 'French industry', 'French working class' are to some extent myths\" (7). (It is interesting to observe that this is one of G. William Skinner's central insights into Chinese history as well, especially in his analysis of the historical relevance of \"macroregions\" in China.  Here's an earlier post on Skinner's work.)So what are the patterns and causal factors that have given rise to \"modern France\" in Todd's reckoning?  Crudely, Todd argues that there are large regional patterns of culture, demography, and property that created distinct dynamics of change across eight centuries of French history.  The southern half of France is characterized by complex family systems with several generations in the same household and a low rate of reproduction, in contrast to the nuclear families of the north and their higher rate of reproduction.  The family values of the southern region gave greater importance to literacy and education than the nuclear (and larger) families of the north.  And family structure, patterns of inheritance, and land tenure are in turn highly relevant to the formation of large patterns of ideology.  (A similar logic is expressed in another of Todd's books, The Explanation of Ideology: Family Structure and Social Systems (Family, Sexuality and Social Relations in Past Times).)The central analytical device in Todd's argument is a fascinating series of maps of France coding the 90 d\u00e9partements of France by such variables as the percent of women holding the baccalaur\u00e9at, the percentage of priests accepting the serment constitutionnel (revolutionary loyalty oath) in 1791, or the percentage of workers in a given industrial sector.  The maps display striking geographical patterns documenting Todd's interpretation of the large historical patterns and their underlying anthropological and geographical causes.  At the largest scale, he argues for three axes of historical causation: a north-south axis defined by family structure that creates differentials of literacy and population growth; an east-west axis defined by the diffusion of industry from northern Europe into eastern France and across the map from east to west; and a political pattern different from both of these, extending from Paris at the political center to the periphery in all directions.  The following is a great example; Todd is interested in observing the degree of \"religiosity\" across France around the time of the Revolution, and he uses the percentage of priests who accepted the oath of allegiance demanded by the Revolutionary government as a measure.  The resulting map reveals conspicuous patterns; the periphery and the south stand out as non-conformist.Todd also argues that there is a causal order among the large social factors he singles out.  Family structure is causally relevant to literacy and education level; literacy is relevant to religious dissent and the emergence of Cathars, Waldensians, and Protestants; family structure is relevant to reproductive rates which are in turn relevant to the spread of industry; and traditions of inheritance are relevant to a region's receptiveness to the ideology of the Revolution.  And the patterns created by these causal processes are very persistent; so the southern belt of high-literacy d\u00e9partements of the twelfth century coincides almost exactly with the pattern of high incidence of baccalaur\u00e9ats and doctors in the late twentieth century.A particularly interesting part of Todd's analysis for me is his effort to map out the agrarian regimes of pre-revolutionary France (the ancien r\u00e9gime).  He observes that this hasn't been done by existing studies of French rural society, and that there is no suitable statistical data on the basis of which to do so for the eighteenth century in any case.  However, he makes use of the first census in 1851 to infer back a century in order to arrive at an analysis into four categories: large estates with hired labor, peasant proprietorship, tenant farming, and share-cropping.  And using the mid-nineteenth century census data he constructs this map:Note that the large estates are concentrated in the center of France, including Paris; while peasant proprietorship (sometimes combined with share-cropping) predominates in the southern tier.  Note as well how closely these patterns conform to the distribution of family structure and fertility at the top of the posting.  And Todd argues that these patterns showed substantial continuity before and after the Revolution (61).  In other words, there is a very substantial overlap between agrarian regimes and the anthropological-demographic patterns discussed earlier.  Todd then uses these geographical patterns to explain something different: the pattern of de-christianization that took place over the century following the Revolution.  Basically, de-christianization is associated with the regions involving a large number of landless workers, whereas this cultural process was least virulent in regions of peasant proprietorship.  Todd summarizes this way:The link between family and agrarian system will help us to understand why dechristianization gained ground, from 1791 onwards, in regions of large farms and share-cropping, and met with resistance in provinces where tenant farming and peasant proprietorship were predominant.  This proposition can, moreover, be reformulated thanks to equivalences between family types and agrarian systems. Dechristianization spread in regions where the family structure was egalitarian nuclear or community, but failed in provinces where the family was stem or absolute nuclear.In other words -- an explanation of ideology and religion in terms of a set of demographic and social characteristics that are distributed differentially across regions.I haven't touched on the dynamics of politics at all here, which is an important piece of Todd's work.  But these comments suffice to illustrate the pattern of historical thinking represented by Todd's work.  It is striking for its effort to cross genres, incorporating geography, anthropology, and sociology into the formation of large interpretations of French history.  And it is striking for the scale of the canvas that he attempts to paint."}, {"title": "Great structures?", "date": "Sunday, January 25, 2009", "text": "The scholars of the Annales school of French history characteristically placed their analysis of historical change within the context of the large structures -- economic, social, or demographic -- within which ordinary people live out their lives. They postulate that the broad and enduring social relations that exist in a society -- for example, property relations, administrative and political relations, or the legal system -- constitute a stable structure within which agents act, and they determine the distribution of crucial social resources that become the raw materials on the basis of which agents exercise power over other individuals and groups. So the particular details of a social structure create the conditions that set the stage for historical change in the society. (The recently translated book by Andr\u00e9 Burgui\u00e8re provides an excellent discussion of the Annales school; The Annales School: An Intellectual History.)The Annales school also put forward a concept that applies to the temporal structure of historical change: the idea that some historical changes unfold over very long periods of time and are all but invisible to participants -- the history of the longue dur\u00e9e. So large enduring structures, applying their effects over very long periods of historical time, provided a crucial part of the historical imagination of the Annales school.Marc Bloch's own treatment of French feudalism illustrates a sustained analysis of a group of great structures enduring centuries over much of the territory of France (Feudal Society: Vol 1: The Growth and Ties of Dependence), as does Le Roy Ladurie's treatment of the causes of change and stasis in Languedoc in The Peasants of Languedoc.  Fernand Braudel's Civilization and Capitalism, 15th-18th Century, Vol. I: The Structure of Everyday Life represents another clear example of historical research organized around analysis of great structures.  And though not a member of the Annales school, I would include M. I. Finley's treatment of the ancient economy as another important example (The Ancient Economy); Finley attempts to trace out the features of property, economy, and political and military power through which ordinary life and historical change proceeded in the ancient world. But there is an important difference among the several works: Bloch, Braudel, and Finley represent an analysis of these structures as a whole, while Le Roy Ladurie's work largely attempts to explain features of life over a very long time that show the imprint of such structures. One is macrohistory, while the other is microhistory.What are some examples of putative \u201cgreat structures\u201d? There are several that readily come to mind: a nation's economic system, its system of law, legislation, and enforcement; its system of government, taxation, and policy-making, its educational system, religious organizations and traditions, the composite system of organizations that exist within civil society, and the norms and relations of the family.The scope of action matters here; the background assumption is that a great structure encompasses a large population and territory. (So we would not call the specific marriage customs that govern a small group of Alpine villages but extend no further a \"great structure.\") And it is further assumed that the hypothesized structure possesses a high degree of functional continuity and integration; there are assumed to be concrete social processes that assure that the structure works in roughly the same way throughout its scope to regulate behavior. The idea of a \"great structure\" thus requires that we attend to the contrast between locally embodied institutions showing significant variation across time and space, and the supposedly more homogeneous workings of \"great structures.\"  We need to be able to provide an account of the extended social mechanisms that establish the effects and stability of the great structure.  If we cannot validate these assumptions about scope, continuity, and functional similarity, then the concept of a \"great structure\" collapses onto a concatenation of vaguely similar institutions in different times and places.To fit the bill, then, a great structure should have some specific features of scope and breadth. It should be geographically widespread, affecting a large population. It should have roughly similar characteristics and effects on behavior in the full range of its scope. And it should be persistent over an extended period of time -- decades or longer.The most basic question is this: are there great structures?  On the positive side, it is possible to identify social mechanisms that secure the functional stability of certain institutions over a large reach of territory and time.  A system of law is enforced by the agents of the state; so it is reasonable to assume that there will be similar legal institutions in Henan and Sichuan when there is an effective imperial government.  A system of trading and credit may have centrally enforced and locally reinforcing mechanisms that assure that it works similarly in widely separated places.  A normative system regulating marriage may be stabilized by local behaviors over a wide space.  The crucial point here is simply this: if we postulate that a given structure has scope over a wide range, we need to have a theory of some of the social mechanisms that convey its power and its reproduction over time. So the existence of great structures is ambiguous.  Yes\u2014in that there are effective institutions of politics, economics, and social life that are real and effectual within given historical settings, and we have empirical understanding of some of the mechanisms that reproduce these structures.  But no\u2014in that all social structures are historically rooted; so there is no \u201cessential\u201d state or economy which recurs in different settings. Instead, political and economic structures may be expected to evolve in different historical settings. And a central task of historical research is to discover both the unifying dynamics and the differentiating expressions which these abstract processes take in different historical settings."}, {"title": "Everyday social interactions", "date": "Tuesday, January 20, 2009", "text": "It is apparent that there are patterns in the ordinary social interactions between individuals in various societies. Whether and how to greet an acquaintance or a stranger, how close people stand together, how loudly people speak, what subjects they turn to in idle social conversation, how conflict is handled -- all of these topics and more seem to have specific and nuanced answers in various specific social environments. And it seems likely enough that there are persistent differences at this level of social behavior across cities, gender, race, and class.So is there room for social science in this domain of social behavior? And what sorts of concepts and theories help us in trying to characterize this type of social behavior?On the first question, there is no doubt that there are researchers and traditions that have addressed exactly these sorts of questions. Erving Goffman's writings are most directly relevant (for example, Behavior in Public Places: Notes on the Social Organization of Gatherings), and urban anthropologists and sociologists are often interested in micro-descriptions of social behaviors as well -- for example, William Foote Whyte's Street Corner Society: The Social Structure of an Italian Slum or Elliott Liebow's Tally's Corner: A Study of Negro Streetcorner Men.Here is one of Goffman's descriptions of his goals:By and large, the psychiatric study of situational improprieties has led to studying the offender rather than the rules and social circles that are offended. Through such studies, however, psychiatrists have inadvertently made us more aware of an important area of social life -- that of behavior in public and sempublic places.  Although this has not been recognized as a special domain for sociological inquiry, it perhaps should be, for rules of conduct in streets, parks, restaurants, theaters, shops, dance floors, meeting halls, and other gathering places of any community tell us a great deal about its most diffuse forms of social organization.Sociology does not provide a ready framework that can order these data, let alone show comparisons and continuities with behavior in private gathering places such as offices, factory floors, living rooms, and kitchens.  To be sure, one part of \"collective behavior\" -- riots, crowds, panics -- has been established as something to study.  But the remaining part of the area, the study of ordinary human traffic and the patterning of ordinary social contacts, has been little considered.  ...  It is the object of this report to try to develop such a framework.  (Behavior in Public Places, 3-4)The school of ethnomethodology also attempts to provide this kind of detailed observation and description.   This approach is illustrated, for example, by Harold Garfinkel's descriptions of the procedures embodied in the practices of professional accountants or lawyers in Studies in Ethnomethodology.  A major objective of the method is to arrive at an interpretation of the rules that underlie everyday activity and thus constitute part of the normative basis of a given social order.  Research from this perspective generally focuses on mundane forms of social activity--e.g. psychiatrists evaluating patients' files, jurors deliberating on defendants' culpability, or coroners judging cause of death.  The investigator then attempts to reconstruct an underlying set of rules and ad hoc procedures that may be taken to have guided the observed activity. The approach emphasizes the contextuality of social practice--the richness of unspoken shared understandings that guide and orient participants' actions in a given practice or activity.So there is quite a bit of work in anthropology and sociology that chooses to provide careful observation and description of concrete social behavior.But there is a more fundamental question to ask: in what sense is this research scientific? What would a scientific study of the patterns of face-to-face social behavior need to provide? And why would this subject be of genuine interest from a scientific point of view?One feature that stands out in the work of Goffman, Whyte, Liebow, or Garfinkel is the commitment of these observers to careful, detailed observation and description of social behavior. They are interested in capturing the nuances of ordinary behavior, and their research reports give a great deal of emphasis to the importance of providing detailed descriptions of ordinary social interactions. And in fact, it seems very reasonable to say that this body of descriptions is itself scientifically valuable and intellectually challenging, perhaps in some of the ways that the careful observations and descriptions produced by Darwin or Wallace in the Galapagos or Malaysia are scientifically important.  Here the standard of scientific value is empirical: it is very important for the observer to \"get it right\" -- to accurately observe and record the fine differences in behavior that are embedded in the social contexts that are observed.  (See an earlier posting on the subject of descriptive social science.)But we can also discern a second scientific objective at work in these kinds of writings, either directly or indirectly -- the goal of arriving at an explanation of the patterns of behavior that are uncovered through this micro-descriptive work.  Any body of phenomena that demonstrates consistent patterns over time is potentially of scientific interest, because the observable patterns imply an underlying causal order that ought to be discoverable. And this is the more true if there are stable differences in the patterns across contexts.  If there are very specific patterns of behavior in these mundane situations of social encounter, how are we to explain that fact?  What sort of structure or fact could count as a cause of these patterns of behavior?One particularly appealing approach to explanation in these circumstances is to make an inference from behavior to rules that is familiar from Chomsky's view of generative linguistics -- from patterned behavior to the underlying \"grammar\" or system of rules and mental paradigms that produces it.  So we might go a bit beyond Goffman's own description of his work, and say that his detailed descriptions of social behavior invite him to reconstruct the underlying and psychologically real set of rules that \"generate\" the behavior.  Here we are invited to consider the social actor as possessing a \"grammar\" of ordinary behavior that guides the production of actions in specified circumstances.  And in fact this interpretation of the intellectual project of this work seems pretty consistent with Garfinkel's approaches.There is a third angle that one might take on this work -- that it is a part of \"interpretive\" social science; that the descriptive work is an effort to provide an interpretation of the meanings of the actions described.  This doesn't seem quite right in application to the works mentioned here, however.  Goffman's work or Whyte's descriptions aren't exactly hermeneutic; instead, they are guided by an effort to discern and capture the smallest nuances of behavior, with an eye to discovering the underlying rules that appear to generate the behavior.  The orientation of the work is not so much directed to underlying meanings as it is to underlying rules.In short, it seems to me that the careful observation and description of the subtle complexities of ordinary social behavior is in fact a valuable contribution to a scientific understanding of the social world -- even though it is primarily descriptive.  The patterns of behavior that Goffman, White, or Liebow document are a genuine and novel contribution to our knowledge of the concrete social world.  And these contributions to descriptive sociology can be fitted into next-generation efforts to provide explanatory contexts that would make sense of the patterns that these researchers document."}, {"title": "Habits, plans, and improvisation", "date": "Sunday, January 18, 2009", "text": "How does thought figure in our ordinary actions and plans?  To what extent are our routine actions the result of deliberation and planning, and to what extent do we function on auto-pilot and habit?It is clear that much of one's daily activity is habitual: routine actions and social responses that reflect little internal deliberation and choice.  Habitual behavior comes into all aspects of life -- daily morning routines (exercise, shower, choose a tie, make a fast breakfast), routine work activities (turn on the computer, check the email account, riffle through the paperwork in the inbox, review the morning's business reports), and routine social contacts (greet the co-worker in the parking lot, gossip about the local news with the admin assistant, laugh about a lopsided weekend football score with a faculty colleague).Particularly interesting is the last category of behavior -- the fairly specific modes of interaction we've learned in response to typical social situations. What do you do if you bump into a person with your shoulder at a buffet line? How do you respond to a person who greets you familiarly but whom you don't know? How do you interact with your boss, your peer, and your subordinate? How do you queue with other passengers when exiting a crowded airplane? When do you make a joke in a small group, and when is it better to keep quiet? In these and hundreds of other stereotyped social encounters we have learned stylized ways of behaving, so when the occasion arises we slip into habitual gear. And it seems certain that there are highly patterned differences in the repertoires of social habits associated with different cultures and sub-cultures -- how to greet, how to handle minor conflicts, how to comport oneself. These repertoires of habits and stereotyped behavioral scenarios are an important component of the \"culture\" we wear.It is interesting to reflect a bit on how habits are socially and psychologically embodied, and to consider whether this is an avenue through which social differences among groups are maintained. (This topic parallels earlier postings on local cultures and practices.)What is \"habitual\" about these forms of behavior is the idea that they seem to be learned patterns of response, involving little reflection or deliberation. They become small \"programs\" of behavior that we have internalized through past experience; and they are invoked by the shuffling of the cards of ordinary experience. It is as if the \"action executive\" of the mind consults a library of routines and deploys a relevant series of behaviors in the context of a particular social environment.But of course, not all action is habitual. The opposite end of the spectrum includes both deliberation and improvisation. These categories themselves are different from each other. Deliberation involves explicit consideration of one's goals, the opportunities that are currently available within the environment of choice, and the pro's and con's of the various choices. Deliberation results in deliberate, planned choice. This represents the category of agency that is partially captured by rational choice theory: deliberate analysis of means and ends, and a calculating choice among possible actions. Planning is an extended version of this process, in which the actor attempts to orchestrate a series of actions and responses in such a way as to bring about a longterm goal.Improvisation differs from both habit and deliberation. Improvisation is a creative response to a current and changing situation. It involves intelligent, fluid adaptation to the current situation, and seems more intuitive than analytical. The skilled basketball player displays improvisational intelligence as he changes his dribble, stutter-steps around a defender, switches hands, and passes to a teammate streaking under the basket for the score. At each moment there are shifting opportunities that appear and disappear as defenders lose their man, teammates slip into view, and the shot clock winds down. This series of actions is unplanned but non-habitual, and it displays an important aspect of situational intelligence. Bourdieu captures a lot of this aspect of intelligent behavior in his concept of habitus in Outline of a Theory of Practice."}, {"title": "Unintended consequences", "date": "Friday, January 16, 2009", "text": "International relations studies offer plentiful examples of the phenomenon of unintended consequences -- for example, wars that break out unexpectedly because of actions taken by states to achieve their security, or financial crises that erupt because of steps taken to avert them. (The recent military escalations in Pakistan and India raise the specter of unintended consequences in the form of military conflict between the two states.) But technology development, city planning, and economic development policy all offer examples of the occurrence of unintended consequences deriving from complex plans as well.Putting the concept schematically -- an actor foresees an objective to be gained or an outcome to be avoided. The actor creates a plan of action designed to achieve the objective or avert the undesired outcome. The plan is based on a theory of the causal and social processes that govern the domain in question and the actions that other parties may take.  The plan of action, however, also creates an unforeseen or unintended series of developments that lead to a result that is contrary to the actor's original intentions.It's worth thinking about this concept a bit. An unintended consequence is different than simply an undesired outcome; a train wreck or a volcano is not an unintended consequence, but rather simply an unfortunate event. Rather, the concept fits into the framework of intention and purposive action. An unintended consequence is a result that came about because of deliberate actions and policies that were set in train at an earlier time -- so an unintended consequence is the result of deliberate action. But the outcome is not one of the goals to which the plan or action was directed; it is \"unintended\". In other words, analysis of the concept of unintended consequences fits into what we might call the \"philosophy of complex action and planning.\" (Unlikely as this sub-specialty of philosophy might sound, here's a good example of a work in this field by Michael Bratman, Intention, Plans, and Practical Reason. Robert Merton wrote about the phenomenon of unintended consequences quite a bit, based on his analysis of the relationships between policy and social science knowledge, in Social Theory and Social Structure.)But there is also an element of paradox in our normal uses of the concept of an unintended consequence -- the suggestion that plans of action often contain elements that work out to defeat them. The very effort to bring about X creates a dynamic that frustrates the achievement of X. This is suggested by the phrase, the \"law of unintended consequences.\"  (I think this is what Hegel refers to as the cunning of reason.)There is an important parallel between unintended and unforeseen consequences, but they are not the same. A harmful outcome may have occurred precisely because because it was unforeseen -- it might have been easily averted if the planner had been aware of it as a possible consequence. An example might be the results of the inadvertent distribution of a contaminant in the packaging of a food product. But it is also possible that an undesired outcome is both unintended but also fully foreseen. An example of this possibility is the decision of state legislators to raise the speed limit to 70 mph. Good and reliable safety statistics make it readily apparent that the accident rate will rise. Nonetheless the officials may reason that the increase in efficiency and convenience more than offsets the harm of the increase in the accident rate. In this case the harmful result is unintended but foreseen. (This is the kind of situation where cost-benefit analysis is brought to bear.)Is it essential to the idea of unintended consequences that the outcome in question be harmful or undesirable? Or is the category of \"beneficial unintended consequence\" a coherent one? There does seem to be an implication that the unintended consequence is one that the actor would have avoided if possible, so a beneficial unintended consequence violates this implicature. But I suppose we could imagine a situation like this: a city planner sets out to design a park that will give teenagers a place to play safely, increase the \"green\" footprint of the city, and draw more families to the central city. Suppose the plan is implemented and each goal is achieved. But it is also observed that the rate of rat infestation in surrounding neighborhoods falls dramatically -- because the park creates habitat for voracious rat predators. This is an unintended but beneficial consequence. And full knowledge of this dynamic would not lead the planner to revise the plan to remove this feature.The category of \"unintended but foreseen consequences\" is easy to handle from the point of view of rational planning. The planner should design the plan so as to minimize avoidable bad consequences; then do a cost-benefit analysis to assess whether the value of the intended consequences outweighs the harms associated with the unintended consequences.The category of consequences of a plan that are currently unforeseen is more difficult to handle from the point of view of rational decision-making. Good planning requires that the planner make energetic efforts to canvass the consequences the plan may give rise to. But of course it isn't possible to discover all possible consequences of a line of action; so the possibility always exists that there will be persistent unforeseen negative consequences of the plan. The most we can ask, it would seem, is that the planner should exercise due diligence in exploring the most likely collateral consequences of the plan. And we might also want the planner to incorporate some sort of plan for \"soft landings\" in cases where unforeseen negative consequences do arise.Finally, is there a \"law of unintended consequences\", along the lines of something like this:\"No matter how careful one is in estimating the probable consequences of a line of action, there is a high likelihood that the action will produce harmful unanticipated consequences that negate the purpose of the action.\"No; this statement might be called \"reverse teleology\" or negative functionalism, and certainly goes further than empirical experience or logic would support.   The problem with this statement is the inclusion of the modifier \"high likelihood\". Rather, what we can say is this:\"No matter how careful one is in estimating the probable consequences of a line of action, there is the residual possibility that the action will produce harmful unanticipated consequences that negate the purpose of the action.\"And this statement amounts to a simple, prudent observation of theoretical modesty: we can't know all the possible results of an action undertaken.  Does the possibility that any plan may have unintended harmful consequences imply that we should not act? Certainly not; rather, it implies that we should be as ingenious as possible in trying to anticipate at least the most likely consequences of the contemplated actions.  And it suggests the wisdom of action plans that make allowances for soft landings rather than catastrophic failures.(Writers about the morality of war make quite a bit about the moral significance of consequences of action that are unintended but foreseen. Some ethicists refer to the principle of double effect, and assert that moral responsibility attaches differently to intended versus unintended but foreseen consequences. The principles of military necessity and proportionality come into the discussion at this point. There is an interesting back-and-forth about the doctrine of double effect in the theory of just war in relation to Gaza on Crooked Timber and Punditry.)"}, {"title": "Predictions", "date": "Thursday, January 15, 2009", "text": "Image: Artillery, 1911. Roger de La Fresnaye. Metropolitan Museum, New YorkIn general I'm skeptical about the ability of the social sciences to offer predictions about future social developments. (In this respect I follow some of the instincts of Oskar Morgenstern in On the Accuracy of Economic Observations.)  We have a hard time answering questions like these:How much will the first installment of TARP improve the availability of credit within three months?Will the introduction of UN peacekeeping units reduce ethnic killings in the Congo?Will the introduction of small high schools improve student performance in Chicago?Will China develop towards more democratic political institutions in the next twenty years?Will American cities witness another round of race riots in the next twenty years?However, the situation isn't entirely negative, and there certainly are some social situations for which we can offer predictions in at least a probabilistic form. Here are some examples:The unemployment rate in Michigan will exceed 10% sometime in the next six months.Coalition casualties in the Afghanistan war will be greater in 2009 than in 2008.Illinois Governor Blogojevich will leave office within six months.Germany will be the world leader in solar energy research by 2020 (link).The Chinese government will act strategically to prevent emergence of regional independent labor organizations.It is worth exploring the logic and function of prediction for a few lines. Fundamentally, it seems that prediction is related to the effort to forecast the effects of interventions, the trajectory of existing trends, and the likely strategies of powerful social actors. We often want to know what will be the net effect of introducing X into the social environment. (For example, what effect on economic development would result from a region's succeeding in increasing the high school graduation rate from 50% to 75%?) We may find it useful to project into the future some social trends that can be observed in the present. (Demographers' prediction that the United States will be a \"majority-minority\" population by 2042 falls in this category (link).) And we can often do quite a bit of rigorous reasoning about the likely actions of leaders, policy makers, and other powerful actors given what we know about their objectives and their beliefs. (We can try to forecast the outcome of the current impasse between Russia and Ukraine over natural gas by analyzing the strategic interests of both sets of decision-makers and the constraints to which they must respond.)So the question is, what kinds of predictions can we make in the social realm? And what circumstances limit our ability to predict?Predictions about social phenomena are based on a couple of basic modes of reasoning:extrapolation of current trendsmodeling of causal hypotheses about social mechanisms and structuresreasoning about strategic actions likely to be taken by actorsderivation of future states of a system from a set of lawsAnd predictions can be presented in a range of levels of precision, specificity, and confidence:prediction of a single event or outcome: the selected social system will be in state X at time T.prediction of the range within which a variable will fall: the selected social variable will fall within a range Q \u00b120%.prediction of the range of outcome scenarios that are most likely: \"Given current level of unrest, rebellion 60%, everyday resistance 30%, resolution 10%\"prediction of the direction of change: the variable of interest will increase/decrease over the specified time periodprediction of the distribution of properties over a group of events/outcomes. X percent of interventions will show improvement of variable Y.Here are some particular obstacles to reliable predictions in the social realm:unquantifiable causal hypotheses -- \"small schools improve student performance\". How large is the effect? How does it weigh in relation to other possible causal factors?indeterminate interaction effects -- how will school policy changes interact with rising unemployment to jointly influence school attendance and performance?open causal fields.  What other currently unrecognized causal factors are in play?the occurrence of unpredictable exogenous events or processes (outbreak of disease)ceteris paribus conditions. These are frequently unsatisfied.So where does all this leave us with respect to social predictions?  A few points seem relatively clear.Specific prediction of singular events and outcomes seems particularly difficult: the collapse of the Soviet Union, China's decision to cross the Yalu River in the Korean War, or the onset of the Great Depression were all surprises to the experts.Projection of stable trends into the near future seems most defensible -- though of course we can give many examples of discontinuities in previously stable trends. Projection of trends over medium- and long-term is more uncertain -- given the likelihood of intervening changes of structure, behavior, and environment that will alter the trends over the extended time.Predictions of limited social outcomes, couched in terms of a range of possibilities attached to estimates of probabilities and based on analysis of known causal and strategic processes, also appear defensible. The degree of confidence we can have in such predictions is limited by the possibility of unrecognized intervening causes and processes.The idea of forecasting the total state of a social system given information about the current state of the system and a set of laws of change is entirely indefensible. This is unattainable; societies are not systems of variables linked by precise laws of transition."}, {"title": "A better social ontology", "date": "Sunday, January 11, 2009", "text": "I believe that the social sciences need to be framed out of consideration of a better understanding of the nature of the social\u2014a better social ontology.  The social world is not a system of law-governed processes; it is instead a mix of different sorts of institutions, forms of human behavior, natural and environmental constraints, and contingent events.  The entities that make up the social world at a given time and place have no particular ontological stability; they do not fall into \u201cnatural kinds\u201d; and there is no reason to expect deep similarity across a number of ostensibly similar institutions \u2013 states, for example, or labor unions.  (W. V. O. Quine\u2019s metaphor of the bushes shaped to look like elephants comes to mind here; Word and Object.)So the rule for the social world is \u2013 heterogeneity, contingency, and plasticity.  And the metaphysics associated with classical thinking about the natural world \u2013 laws of nature, common, unchanging structures, and predictable processes of change \u2013 do not provide appropriate metaphors for our understandings and expectations of the social world. Nor do they suggest the right kinds of social science theories and constructs.Instead of naturalism, I suggest an approach to social science theorizing that emphasizes agency, contingency, and plasticity in the makeup of social facts.   It recognizes that there is a degree of pattern in social life \u2013 but emphasizes that these patterns fall far short of the regularities associated with laws of nature.  It emphasizes contingency of social processes and outcomes.  It insists upon the importance and legitimacy of eclectic use of social theories: the processes are heterogeneous, and therefore it is appropriate to appeal to different types of social theories as we explain social processes.  It emphasizes the importance of path-dependence in social outcomes.  It suggests that the most valid scientific statements in the social sciences have to do with the discovery of concrete social-causal mechanisms, through which some types of social outcomes come about.And finally, this approach highlights what I call \u201cmethodological localism\u201d: the view that the foundation of social action and outcome is the local, socially-located and socially constructed individual person.  The individual is socially constructed, in that her modes of behavior, thought, and reasoning are created through a specific set of prior social interactions.  And her actions are socially situated, in the sense that they are responsive to the institutional setting in which she chooses to act.  Purposive individuals, embodied with powers and constraints, pursue their goals in specific institutional settings; and regularities of social outcome often result.How does this perspective fit with current work in the social sciences?  There are several current fields of social research that are particularly well suited to this approach.  One is the field of comparative historical sociology, in its use of fairly detailed studies of similar cases in order to identify common causal mechanisms.  Kathleen Thelen\u2019s astute studies of different institutions of skill formation in Germany, UK, US, and Japan are an excellent case in point; she asks the twin questions, what causal processes give stability to a set of institutions?  And what causal processes lead to a process of transformation in those institutions?  The research methods of comparative historical sociology, then, are particularly well suited to the ontology of contingency, plasticity, and causal mechanisms (How Institutions Evolve: The Political Economy of Skills in Germany, Britain, the United States, and Japan).Ethnography gives us a different angle on this same ontology.  Ethnographers can give us insight into culturally specific mentalities\u2014the \u201csocially constructed individuals\u201d.  And they can give concrete analysis of the institutions that both shape individuals and are in turn shaped by them.  More generally, qualitative research methods can offer a basis for discovery of some of the features of agency, mentality, and culture within the context of which important social processes take place. A good current example is Leslie Salzinger's Genders in Production: Making Workers in Mexico's Global Factories, a study of the social construction of femininity in the factories of the maquiladoras.  C. K. Lee's sociology of Chinese factory protests is also a model of a study that combines qualitative and quantitative methods; Against the Law: Labor Protests in China's Rustbelt and Sunbelt.The new institutionalism is a third theoretical perspective on social analysis and explanation.  This approach postulates the causal reality of institutions; it highlights the point that differences across institutions lead to substantial differences in behavior; and it provides a basis for explanations of various social outcomes.  The rules of liability governing the predations of cattle in East Africa or Shasta County, California, create very different patterns of behavior in cattle owners and other land owners in the various settings.  (Mary Brinton and Victor Nee, The New Institutionalism in Sociology; Jean Ensminger, Making a Market: The Institutional Transformation of an African Society.)   It is characteristic of the new institutionalism that researchers in this tradition generally avoid reifying large social institutions and look instead at the more proximate and variable institutions within which people live and act.What kind of social science research and theory corresponds to these assumptions about social ontology?  Here are some chief features--They make use of eclectic multiple theories and don't expect a unified social theory that explains everythingThey are modest in their expectations about social generalizationsThey look for causal mechanisms as a basis for social explanationThey anticipate heterogeneity and plasticity of social entitiesThey are prepared to use eclectic methodologies -- quantitative, comparative, case-study, ethnographic -- to discover the mechanisms and mentalities that underlie social changeWe need a better sociology for the twenty-first century.  If social scientists continue to be captivated by the scientific prestige of positivism and quantitative social science to the exclusion of other perspectives, they will be led to social science research that looks quite different from what would result from a view that emphasizes contingency and causal mechanisms. And if there are strong, engaging, and empirically rigorous examples of other ways of conducting social research that can come into broad exposure in the social sciences\u2014then there is a greater probability of emergence of a genuinely innovative and imaginative approach to the problem of social knowledge."}, {"title": "Social agency and rational choice", "date": "Saturday, January 10, 2009", "text": "One of the reasons that rational choice theory (RC)  is appealing is that it is an agent-centered approach to social explanation: explain the social outcome on the basis of an analysis of the beliefs, intentions, and circumstances of the individual agents who make up the social setting.  What rational choice theory adds to this description is a specification of the decision-making processes that are attributed to the individual agent -- typically, that the agent has a consistent set of preferences among accessible alternatives and that he/she chooses in such a way as to maximize the satisfaction of this set of preferences.  This can be paraphrased as a \"utility-maximizing\" model of decision-making.Many objections have been offered against rational-choice theory as a basis for social explanation -- for example, that it overlooks social motivations, that it presupposes egoism, that it over-simplifies the logic of practical reasoning, or that it fails to correspond to typical human behavior.  (See Green and Shapiro, Pathologies of Rational Choice Theory: A Critique of Applications in Political Science, for a developed set of critiques.)Two points are worth underlining here.  First, rational-choice theory has a major theoretical advantage precisely because it is an agent-centered framework.  RC theory is one possible way of articulating a set of hypotheses about how individuals reason and act. This is a major advantage in comparison to explanatory frameworks that essentially assume programmed behavior on the part of participants in a social event.  Moreover, the assumption of preference-satisfaction lines up pretty well with a somewhat broader conception of human action in terms of goal-directedness and purposiveness.  If we believe that individuals have goals and purposes that underlie their choices and actions, then it is an appealing simplification to represent their actions as the outcome of deliberation about goals, strategies, and circumstances.  In other words, RC theory can be seen as a specification of a philosophical idea of human action that is at least as old as Aristotle: the idea of individuals as deliberative, purposive agents.  And this is in fact a credible and empirically defensible theory of action.But a second point is equally important: RC theory and its model of utility maximization is only one out of a range of possible specifications of the idea of deliberation and purposiveness.  There are important alternative specifications that can be offered.  For example, we might say, along with Kant, that individuals possess a set of moral rules as well as a set of specific goals, and that they deliberate among possible choices of action on the basis of both considerations.  How do the various possible actions conform to the moral rules?  And how do they do from the point of view of accomplishing my goals?  This process of reasoning is \"deontological\" -- that is, it cannot be subsumed under a simple model of maximizing rationality.  It is, nonetheless, an intelligible interpretation of what rational human decision-making involves.  (Mark Johnson's Moral Imagination: Implications of Cognitive Science for Ethics is interesting in its effort to bring cognitive science into dialogue with ethical theory.)Another possible interpretation of the basic idea of deliberativeness that diverges from RC theory is one that illustrates some themes that Amartya Sen (On Ethics and Economics), James Scott (The Moral Economy of the Peasant: Rebellion and Subsistence in Southeast Asia), and Doug McAdam (Political Process and the Development of Black Insurgency, 1930 -1970) have emphasized: that real human social behavior is a complex mix of commitments, loyalties, emotions, solidarities -- as well as purposes and goals.  So a theory of action that isolates \"goal-directedness\" and its associated framework of utility maximizing, is one that already overlooks a set of motivational factors that are crucial to explaining real social behavior.  It is as if we imagined modeling wine-tasting judgments by experts but \"erased\" their sense of smell.  Given that smell is a crucial ingredient of the experience of tasting wine, our reduced theory won't do a very good job of explaining discrimination across samples by the experts.Instead, when we undertake to explain an individual's action in the context of a spontaneous rent strike, we need to ask a series of questions: what does he/she expect to get out of the action? What loyalties does he/she have to the organization or other participants? What principles does he/she endorse that are relevant to the context of proposed action? What forms of social identity does he/she embody, and how are these strands relevant to the decision to participate or not? How do the emotions created by the words and actions of others influence one's behavior?What makes RC theory useful in spite of these complexities of actual motivation is the fact that there are many important situations of choice where other sources and structures of motivation are of minimal importance.  When a person chooses a new toaster, it is likely enough that solidarity, emotion, principle, and identity drop away, and the choice is based on perceived value and price.  So the market in toasters behaves pretty much as neoclassical economics predicts.  But the market for shoes is probably more complicated: emotion, status, style, identity, and a preference for \"fair-trade\" products may influence one person to buy the more expensive and less functional pair of shoes, while another person will go for the good buy.  Likewise, the decision to join AARP is likely to be a fairly simple calculation -- what are the side benefits of membership, how much importance do I attribute to being part of an organization that represents the public good of people over 50, and how much can I gain from there being a successful AARP? This is simple in comparison to the situation of a rent strike or a street demonstration, where one's face-to-face relations with other potential participants may have a very large impact on the decision to participate or not.So we might say that RC theory represents a special case of the more general category of deliberative action, which is itself a sub-category of intentional action. And RC theory will be most successful in generating explanations in social circumstances where the other sources of social motivation are largely silent -- for example, anonymous market transactions, isolated decisions about participation or non-participation in collective action, and decisions about portfolio investments.What we really need is a more developed and adequate theory of social agency -- a better account of how the various factors mentioned above fit together into one scheme of deliberation and decision-making.  This might be called a full theory of practical rationality.  And it would be a more general specification of the situation of agent-based social action than RC is able to provide."}, {"title": "Economic history analyzed", "date": "Thursday, January 8, 2009", "text": "The history of a region or people encompasses a multitude of aspects of social life: culture, religion, political institutions, social movements, environmental change, technology, population\u2014and the circumstances and processes of economic change that the region undergoes.  One does not need to be a reductionist in order to observe that the economic circumstances a society experiences, and the processes of change that these circumstances undergo, have a profound influence on other aspects of social and cultural change.  Improved agricultural productivity can support population growth; it can enhance the coercive power of state institutions; and it can make possible the flourishing of intricate institutions of religion and education.  Likewise, the constraints created by slow or negative economic productivity growth in a region can stifle the development of other important social processes.  So economic history, as a discipline within history more broadly, is a crucially important field of historical inquiry.Yet the foundations of the discipline of economic history are controversial.  Economic historians do not yet agree on the role of mathematical economic theory within their discipline, or the relationships that should obtain between quantitative and qualitative data, or the role of social theories of causal factors in explaining economic change, or the connections that should be established between economic historical research and other fields of social or cultural history.What is the intellectual task of an \u201ceconomic history\u201d of a region or country?  To start, we might say that it is to provide an evidence-based description of the main economic characteristics of the country or region over a defined period of time: the kinds and levels of agricultural and manufacturing products that are produced, the technologies and institutions through which production and distribution occurs, the size of the population, and the level of material well-being that is experienced by the population.  And, second, the task of economic history is to arrive at causal hypotheses that may serve as explanations of some of the patterns of economic change that are discovered.Consider the variety of questions that need to be addressed by an economic history of a region or country:Demography.  What was the absolute population size and distribution at various time points during the period?  What were the trends of population growth during the peri\u00acod?  How much urbanization occurred during the period?Inputs and technology.  How much land was under cultivation?  What crops and products were in production?  What fertilizer technologies were in use?  How much irrigation was available, and what was the trend of extension of land and irrigation?  Property relations and control of labor.  What forms of tenancy and land ownership were in place?  How were these arrangements changing during the time period?  What forms of labor control were in use?  Was there a tendency of change in the conditions and extent of wage labor?Productivity.  What was the absolute size of the production of central commodities\u2014rice, wheat, cotton?  What were the factor productivities for land, labor, capital, or animal power?  What trends existed in these quantities?Prices and market conditions. How much agricultural activity took place within functioning markets for crops, grain, textiles, and handicraft goods?  What were the prices of these goods over time?  How sensitive were farmers to changing market conditions?Human welfare.  What were the income levels and food security of various groups: landless workers, smallholding peasants, tenants and other groups?  How extensive were income inequalities within the economy?  Where were economic surpluses going?  What was the trend of real welfare and inequalities?Causal factors. What are the causal relationships that obtain between various large factors: technology, social relations, property systems, state, demographic regimes, and international relations? Explanation requires a theory of underlying causal mechanisms.  What theoretical resources are available to the economic historian to explain patterns and singularities of economic change?  It is evident that economic outcomes are the result of human behavior within the context of environmental circumstances and institutional settings.  Human behavior, however, is not rigidly segregated into \u201ceconomic,\u201d \u201ccultural,\u201d and \u201csocial\u201d behavior; rather, behavioral outcomes are influenced by all these kinds of factors.  So economic history cannot be restricted to the theories associated with neoclassical economics.  Rather, the economic historian needs to examine the economic phenomena under study within the broader social and environmental context in which this behavior takes place.  And that means that the economic historian must be as much a social historian, a sociologist, or an ethnographer as he is an economist; he needs to pay as much attention to the social and political context of economic trends as he does to the mathematics of equilibrium or the idealized workings of a market.Marc Bloch\u2019s history of medieval French agriculture (1931) offers a good illustration of the value of a broadly contextualized approach to a region\u2019s economic history (French Rural History: An Essay on Its Basic Characteristics).  Bloch surveys the main social institutions and technologies that were in use, and attempts to explain some of the large patterns that became evident (for example, field shape and the geographical diffusion of the wheeled plough).  Bloch\u2019s explanation invokes such varied factors as the nature of the soils across France, the availability and timing of technical innovations in the design of the plough, and the nature of village communities in different parts of France.  And he makes ingenious use of a wide range of historical sources to permit him to come to assessments of various economic and institutional facts.Well-developed social theories give us a basis for demonstrating how various factors could be causally relevant.  It is then the task of empirical, historical, and theoretical research to arrive at justified conclusions about causation. But theories don't provide scripts for \"necessary\" processes of economic development. In fact, it is entirely possible that different combinations of causal factors are of primary importance in different historical settings.  Historical change is conjunctural and contingent.  The general point is that institutions and circumstances matter, and that institutional arrangements in different times and places may impose limits or opportunities that discourage or favor some pathways of development over others.  Instead of expecting one grand course of development, we ought to expect a shifting fabric of contingent, fluctuating path-dependent processes.Two current economic historians whose work I particularly admire are Bozhong Li, whose careful and deep empirical studies of the economic history of the lower Yangzi delta provide a foundation for a much more finegrained economic history of China (Agricultural Development in Jiangnan, 1620-1850, link); and Robert Allen, whose careful studies of the English farm economy and the standard of living in the early modern period are a paradigm of excellent empirical and analytical work in economic history (link, link).(There is more on this topic on my research webpage, including Epistemological Issues in Economic History and Eurasian Historical Comparisons.)"}, {"title": "Technology and culture", "date": "Monday, January 5, 2009", "text": "Photo: Charles Sheeler, \"Power, wheels\", 1939; MFA, BostonTechnology is sometimes thought of as a domain with a logic of its own -- an inevitable trend towards the development of the most efficient artifacts, given the potential represented by a novel scientific or technical insight.  The most important shift that has occurred in the ways in which historians conceptualize the history of technology in the past thirty years is the clear recognition that technology is a social product, all the way down.  And, as a corollary, historians of technology have increasingly come to recognize the deep contingency that characterizes the development of specific instances or families of technologies.Thomas Hughes is one of the most important and prolific historians of technology of his generation.  His most recent book, Human-Built World: How to Think about Technology and Culture, is well worth reading.  It looks at \"technology\" from a very broad perspective and asks how this dimension of civilization has affected our cultures in the past two centuries.  The twentieth-century city, for example, could not have existed without the inventions of electricity, steel buildings, elevators, railroads, and modern waste-treatment technologies. So technology \"created\" the modern city.  But it is also clear that life in the twentieth-century city was transformative for the several generations of rural people who migrated to them.  And the literature, art, values, and social consciousness of people in the twentieth century have surely been affected by these new technology systems.This level of analysis stands at the most generic perspective: how does technology influence culture?  (And perhaps, how does culture influence technology?)  What Hughes has demonstrated in so much of his work, though, is the fact that the most interesting questions about the \"technology-society\" interface can be framed at a much more disaggregated level. Consider some of the connections he suggests in his earlier book on the history of electric power (Networks of Power: Electrification in Western Society, 1880-1930):Invention (by individuals with a very specific educational and cultural background)Concrete development of the artifacts within a laboratory (involving specific social relationships among various experts and workers)\"Selling\" the innovation to municipal authorities (for lighting and traction) and to industrial capitalists (for power)Finding investors and sources of finance for large capital investments in electricityBuilding out the infrastructure for delivery of electric powerGovernment regulation of industry practicesDevelopment of an extended research capability addressing technology problemsEach part of this complex story involves processes that are highly contingent and highly intertwined with social, economic, and political relationships.  And the ultimate shape of the technology is the result of decisions and pressures exerted throughout the web of relationships through which the technology took shape.  But here is an important point: there is no moment in this story where it is possible to put \"technology\" on one side and \"social context\" on the other.  Instead, the technology and the society develop together.Hughes also explores some of the ways in which the culture of the machine has influenced architecture, art, and literature.  He discusses photography by  Charles Sheeler (whose famous series on the Rouge plant defined an industrial aesthetic), artists Carl Grossberg and Marcel Duchamp, and architects such as Peter Behren.  The central theme here is the idea that industrial-technological developments caused significant cultural change in Europe and America.  Hughes's examples are mostly drawn from \"high\" culture; but historians of popular culture too have focused on the impact of technologies such as the railroad, the automobile, or the cigarette on American popular culture.  See Deborah Clarke's Driving Women: Fiction and Automobile Culture in Twentieth-Century America for a discussion of the effect of automotive culture.  And Pam Pennock's examination of the effects of alcohol and tobacco advertising on American culture in Advertising Sin And Sickness: The Politics of Alcohol And Tobacco Marketing, 1950-1990 is also relevant.Hughes doesn't consider here the other line of influence that is possible between culture and technology: how prevailing aesthetic and cultural preferences influence the development of a technology. This has been an important theme in the line of interpretation referred to as the \"social construction of technology\" (SCOT). Wiebe Bijker makes the case for the social construction of mundane technologies such as bicycles in Of Bicycles, Bakelites, and Bulbs: Toward a Theory of Sociotechnical Change.  And automobile historian Gijs Moms argues in The Electric Vehicle: Technology and Expectations in the Automobile Age that the choice between electric and internal combustion vehicles in the early twentieth century turned on aesthetic and lifestyle preferences rather than technical or economic efficiency.  (Here is a nice short discussion of SCOT.)  This too is a more disaggregated approach to the question.  It proceeds on the idea that we can learn a great deal by examining the \"micro\" processes in culture and society that influence the development of a technology.It seems to me that the conceptual framework of \"assemblages theory\" would be useful in discussing the history of technology. (See Manuel DeLanda's A New Philosophy of Society: Assemblage Theory And Social Complexity for a review of the theory, and Nick Srnicek's blog at accursedshare, which makes frequent use of the framework.)  The framework is useful here because technology is a social phenomenon that extends from one's own kitchen and household to the cities of Chicago or Berlin, to the global internet and the international system of manufacturing and design.  And similar processes of shaping and conditioning occur at the micro, meso, and macro levels.  In other words -- perhaps we can understand \"technology\" at the molar level, as a complex composition of activities and processes at many levels closer to the socially constructed individual.  And the value-added provided by the sociology and history of technology is precisely this: to shed light on the mechanisms at work at all levels that have an influence on the aggregate direction and shape of the resulting technology.Since we're thinking about \"technology and culture\" -- it's worth noting that Technology and Culture is the world's leading journal for the history of technology, emanating from the Society for the History of Technology (SHOT, established in 1958). The journal has played a significant role in the definition of the discipline over the past thirty years or so and is an outstanding source for anyone interested in the questions posed here."}, {"title": "Applied philosophy of history", "date": "Friday, January 2, 2009", "text": "The philosophy of history is difficult to classify. Should we think of it in analogy with the philosophy of physics or economics -- essentially a careful analysis of the modes of research and inference used within an empirical discipline? Or should we think of it in analogy with the philosophy of nature or the philosophy of technology -- essentially an effort to use constructive philosophical methods to attempt to discover important features of the object of study (nature or technology)? The former approach makes the philosophical study a sort of high-level methodology critique, while the latter makes it more of an effort at old-fashioned metaphysics. Hegel's philosophy of history falls in the latter category, while twentieth-century analytic treatments of historical explanation fall in the former category (Hempel, Danto).In the case of history the distinction also parallels the ambiguity between two meanings of \"history\": an organized body of knowledge about the past versus the totality of events and processes that have unfolded over time -- history as knowledge versus history as substantive happenings.So we might say that there are two divergent starting points for a philosophy of history: How do we know and explain the past? And what are the nature and dynamics of historical reality? And philosophers interested in one of these questions are unlikely to be interested in the other. The analytic philosopher who pursues the epistemological questions is likely to believe that philosophy simply and categorically lacks a basis for discovering apriori truths about the external world; substantive metaphysics is not possible. And the philosopher like Hegel or Ricoeur who believes the important questions about history are the substantive ones, is likely to be impatient with a purely analytic and epistemic approach.It is time for philosophers to take a fresh look at the issues raised by history in all its facets. We need some new approaches to the philosophy of history.  And this suggests that we need to get beyond the dichotomy between analytic and substantive approaches to the problems. Fortunately, there seems to be ample intellectual space for us to do so. And many of the challenging \"new\" questions for the philosophy of history cross over the distinction between epistemology and metaphysics.Take for example the problem of providing a more adequate treatment of concepts that are often taken for granted in historical discourse: e.g. structure, mentality, class, event, or revolution. Each of these concepts raises problems that philosophers can help to address. The twin problems of disaggregation and reification arise in each instance. What is a historical structure such as \"the fiscal system of the ancien regime\" composed of? What errors are we led to by asserting things like \"the Revolution in the west was less about economic interests and more about local political competition\"? What do we need to provide as foundation if we want to refer to the \"artisanal mentality of Parisian workers\"? In each instance there is a productive space in which the philosopher and the working historian can arrive at a deeper and more adequate conceptual scheme in terms of which to analyze the historical reality under consideration. And it is worth noticing that this work is not purely analytical; it is also substantive, in the sense that it is shedding new light on real historical phenomena. We might describe this work as falling in the domain of substantive historical ontology.Or think about the potential value of a philosopher's reflections on the range of ways in which talented historians frame their results: Albert Soboul's methodical exposition of the meso-level class identities and interests of the groups contending in 1789 (A Short History of the French Revolution, 1789-1799), Simon Schama's discontinuous exposition of elements of European history around the theme of landscapes (Landscape And Memory), Philip Kuhn's exposition of the cultural-emotional climate of late Imperial China through the lens of a witchcraft scare (Soulstealers: The Chinese Sorcery Scare of 1768). To what extent do these choices about exposition and framework inflect upon the substantive historical findings? How does Peter Perdue's shift of focus from Ming-Qing China to the shifting power relationships in central Asia between Russia, China, and the Mongol empire change our perspective on Chinese diplomacy and warcraft (China Marches West: The Qing Conquest of Central Eurasia)? The philosophical work to be done here is analytical; but it is also illuminating and progressive, in the sense that it lays the basis for a better understanding of the relationship between the historian and the historical domain under scrutiny.These examples suggest a third possible starting point for the new philosophy of history: what are some of the core historical concepts that enter into good examples of historical writing and thinking, and what kinds of puzzles and presuppositions do these concepts bring with them? And what can we discover about historical explanation and knowledge by carefully observing the work of talented, innovative historians?One thing seems clear from this last formulation: the philosopher needs to formulate topics and problems  in close proximity to the historical research of talented historians. In this respect it seems right to regard the philosophy of history as an \"applied\" field. In this way the philosopher avoids the hazard of a uselessly apriori approach to the philosophical study of history. And it suggests yet another way of bridging the divide between analytic and substantive knowledge-building in the philosophy of history: by establishing close and mutually insightful partnerships between philosophers and historians."}, {"title": "Philosophy of X?", "date": "Wednesday, December 31, 2008", "text": "When philosophers do their thinking within a field called \"the philosophy of X\", there is always a natural question that arises: how will philosophical reflection about X be helpful or constructive for the practitioners of X? For example, how might the philosophy of science be helpful for working scientists? How can the philosophy of biology or economics be helpful to biologists or economists? And, for that matter -- why isn't there a philosophy of plumbing or long-distance bus driving?As for the last question, there seem to be two separate reasons for this gap in the spectrum -- a dearth of difficult conceptual problems and a lack of potentially useful consequences. First, philosophy finds traction when it deals with subject matter that raises difficult conceptual or inferential issues. Philosophers are particularly good at untangling unclear concepts; they are experienced at the task of formulating problems clearly and logically; they are ready to unmask the hidden presuppositions underlying a particular formulation. This is the kind of work Wittgenstein describes as \"letting the fly out of the fly bottle\"; it is what J. L. Austin does so well in \"Three ways of spilling ink\" (link). Drawing distinctions and formulating ideas clearly -- these are core intellectual tools, and they lie at the root of philosophy.Another core intellectual tool is the commitment to providing justification for the things we believe, and raising reflective questions about the nature of rational justification. What is the evidence that supports a given belief? What degree of warrant does this evidence create? Why do statements like these make it more likely that P is true? Questions like these too are foundational for philosophy -- from Plato to Locke to Quine. And philosophers have a developed and nuanced set of frameworks and vocabularies in terms of which to interrogate them.Both these types of intellectual work are doubly cognitive. They represent cognitive effort directed at examples of cognitive effort -- efforts to explain the workings of nature, the behavior of other people, or the workings of social institutions. Putting the point very simply -- philosophers are good at helping us think clearly about thinking. And, at their best, they can help us think more clearly and coherently.So now we have part of an answer for why there is no philosophy of plumbing: plumbing is a routine activity with few conceptual puzzles and a secure base of practical knowledge. There just isn't any room for philosophical analysis in this realm. And, second, there is the pragmatic point: it is very hard to see how the plumbers might benefit from philosophical analysis. If Deleuze were to write a treatise on plumbing, how could that possibly enhance the practical discipline of plumbing? The plumbers' effective ability to control the water and waste systems of our buildings would not be enhanced by conceptual or epistemic analysis. Their conceptual and theoretical problems are well-mapped; all that remains is to discover the source of the leak. And this does not require philosophy.Why, then, do we need other philosophies of X's? What is it about economics, evolution, or the mind that makes it intellectually and practically valuable to have a philosophy of economics, biology, or psychology? The answer proceeds along the lines sketched here. All these disciplines confront huge problems of concept formation, theory construction, and inference and justification. The most basic questions remain unsettled: does capitalism exist? How are theories and models related to the empirical world? Is there such a thing as group selection? How do emotions intersect with reasoning?  What is consciousness?  And in all these fields, there is the problem of inference and method -- again, unresolved. So there is ample room for philosophical thinking in these fields.But more importantly, philosophy can help to improve the intellectual practices of the cognitive-empirical disciplines. By working productively in tandem with creative scientific researchers, with a focus on the conceptual and methodological problems that matter the most, philosophers can help contribute to real progress in the disciplines. This requires the philosopher to engage with the discipline in depth. But the fruits of this sort of synergy can be highly productive. It is sometimes complained that philosophy brings only \"logic chopping\" and dry conceptual analysis. But this is a caricature; the conceptual issues faced by the special sciences are deeply challenging, and sustained dialogue with philosophers can potentially lead to meaningful progress in the science. And reciprocally, quite a few traditional concerns of philosophy --in ontology, epistemology, and the theory of the mind, for example -- can be significantly deepened through close engagement with current scientific work.  There need not be a sharp line of demarcation between philosophy and empirical research."}, {"title": "Correspondence, abstraction, and realism", "date": "Monday, December 29, 2008", "text": "Science is generally concerned with two central semantic features of theories: truth of theoretical hypotheses and reliability of observational predictions. (Philosophers understand the concept of semantics as encompassing the relations between a sentence and the world: truth and reference.  This understanding connects with the ordinary notion of semantics as meaning, in that the truth conditions of a sentence are thought to constitute the meaning of the sentence.) Truth involves a correspondence between hypothesis and the world; while predictions involve statements about the observable future behavior of a real system.  Science is also concerned with epistemic values: warrant and justification.  The warrant of a hypothesis is a measure of the degree to which available evidence permits us to conclude that the hypothesis is approximately true.  A hypothesis may be true but unwarranted (that is, we may not have adequate evidence available to permit confidence in the truth of the hypothesis).  Likewise, however, a hypothesis may be false but warranted (that is, available evidence may make the hypothesis highly credible, while it is in fact false).  And every science possesses a set of standards of hypothesis evaluation on the basis of which practitioners assess the credibility of their theories--for example, testability, success in prediction, inter-theoretical support, simplicity, and the like.The preceding suggests that there are several questions that arise in the assessment of scientific theories.  First, we can ask whether a given hypothesis is a good approximation of the underlying social reality--that is, the approximate truth of the hypothesis.  Likewise, we can ask whether the hypothesis gives rise to true predictions about the future behavior of the underlying social reality.  Each of these questions falls on the side of the truth value of the hypothesis.  Another set of questions concerns the warrant of the hypothesis: the strength of the evidence and theoretical grounds available to us on the basis of which we assign a degree of credibility to the hypothesis.  Does available evidence give us reason to believe that the hypothesis is approximately true, and does available evidence give us reason to expect that the hypothesis's predictions are likely to be true?  These questions are centrally epistemic; answers to them constitute the basis of our scientific confidence in the truth of the hypothesis and its predictions.It is important to note that the question of the approximate truth of the hypothesis is separate from that of the approximate truth of its predictions.  It is possible that the hypothesis is approximately true but its predictions are not.  This might be the case because the ceteris paribus conditions are not satisfied, or because low precision of estimates for exogenous variables and parameters leads to indeterminate predictive consequences.  Therefore it is possible that the warrant attaching to the approximate truth of the hypothesis and the reliability of its predictions may be different.  It may be that we have good reason to believe that the hypothesis is a good approximation of the underlying economic reality, while at the same time we have little reason to rely on its predictions about the future behavior of the system.  The warrant of the hypothesis is high on this account, while the warrant of its predictions is low.Whatever position we arrive at concerning the possible truth or falsity of a given economic hypothesis, it is plain that this cannot be understood as literal descriptive truth. Economic hypotheses are not offered as full and detailed representations of the underlying economic reality.  For a hypothesis unavoidably involves abstraction, in at least two ways.  First, the hypothesis deliberately ignores some empirical characteristics and causal processes of the underlying economic reality.  Just as a Newtonian hypothesis of the ballistics of projectiles ignores air resistance in order to focus on gravitational forces and the initial momentum of the projectile, so an economic hypothesis ignores differences in consumption behavior among members of functional defined income groups.  Likewise, a hypothesis may abstract from regional or sectional differences in prices or wage rates within a national economy.  Daniel Hausman provides an excellent discussion of the scope and limits of economic theories in The Inexact and Separate Science of Economics.Another epistemically significant feature of social hypotheses is the difficulty of isolating causal factors in real social or economic systems.  Hypotheses are generally subject to ceteris paribus conditions.  Predictions and counterfactual assertions are advanced conditioned by the assumption that no other exogenous causal factors intervene; that is, the assertive content of the hypothesis is that the economic processes under analysis will unfold in the described manner absent intervening causal factors.  But if there are intervening causal factors, then the overall behavior of the system may be indeterminate.  In some cases it is possible to specify particularly salient interfering causal factors (e.g. political instability).  But it is often necessary to incorporate open-ended ceteris paribus conditions as well.Finally, social theories and hypotheses unavoidably make simplifying or idealizing assumptions about the populations, properties, and processes that they describe.  Consumers are represented as possessing consistent and complete preference rankings; firms are represented as making optimizing choices of products and technologies; product markets are assumed to function perfectly; and so on.Given, then, that hypotheses abstract from reality, in what sense does it make sense to ask whether a hypothesis is true?  We must distinguish between truth and completeness, to start with.  To say that a description of a system is true is not to say that it is a complete description.  (A complete description provides a specification of the value of all state variables for the system--that is, all variables that have a causal role in the functioning of the system.)  The fact that hypotheses are abstractive demonstrates only that they are incomplete, not that they are false.  A description of a hockey puck's trajectory on the ice that assumes a frictionless surface is a true account of some of the causal factors at work: the Newtonian mechanics of the system.  The assumption that the surface of the ice is frictionless is false; but in this particular system the overall behavior of the system (with friction) is sufficiently close to the abstract hypothesis (because frictional forces are small relative to other forces affecting the puck).  In this case, then, we can say two things: first, the Newtonian hypothesis is exactly true as a description of the forces it directly represents, and second, it is approximately true as a description of the system as a whole (because the forces it ignores are small).This account takes a strongly realist position on social theory, in that it characterizes truth in terms of correspondence to unobservable entities, processes, or properties. The presumption here is that social systems generally--and economic systems in particular--have objective unobservable characteristics which it is the task of social science theory to identify.  The realist position is commonly challenged by some economists, however.  Milton Friedman's famous argument for an instrumentalist interpretation of economic theory (Essays in Positive Economics) is highly unconvincing in this context. The instrumentalist position maintains that it is a mistake to understand theories as referring to real unobservable entities.  Instead, theories are simply ways of systematizing observable characteristics of the phenomena under study; the only purpose of scientific theory is to serve as an instrument for prediction.  Along these lines, Friedman argues that the realism of economic premises is irrelevant to the warrant of an economic theory; all that matters is the overall predictive success of the theory.  The instrumentalist approach to the interpretation of economic theory, then, is highly unpersuasive as an interpretation of the epistemic standing of economic hypotheses.  Instead, the realist position appears to be inescapable: we are forced to treat general equilibrium theory as a substantive empirical hypothesis about the real workings of competitive market systems, and our confidence in general equilibrium hypotheses is limited by our confidence in the approximate truth of the general equilibrium theory."}, {"title": "Class in America", "date": "Sunday, December 21, 2008", "text": "Are there social classes in America?In order to answer the question in the affirmative, we would need to determine whether there are major social groups that are defined by their position within the economy, who share --some degree of a common perspective on the worldsome degree of a common culturea set of distinctive economic intereststhe potential of engaging in collective political action in support of their interests.Does American society possess groups with these characteristics?  Or, in the negative, is the American population so homogeneous (or possibly, so heterogeneous) in values, interests, culture, and politics, that the concept of class has no bearing today?There are certainly occupational groupings in the American workforce.  The United States Department of Labor makes use of a hierarchical classification of jobs in the U.S., with 23 major groups.  These include management occupations, business and financial operations, computer and mathematical operations, architecture and engineering operations, food preparation and serving occupations, community and social service occupations, legal occupations, education, training, and library occupations, healthcare support occupations, and, eventually, production occupations.  Within production occupations there is a further differentiation of jobs among supervisors, production workers, assemblers, fabricators, food processing workers, and so on for dozens of other sub-categories.  So there is certainly a very clear occupational structure to the American economy, and the sociological pathways that convey an individual into a particular location within this structure are well-defined and impactful on the future quality of life of the individual.So we might consider classifying these occupations according to some higher-level categories and then constructing a theory of social classes around them: management, unskilled labor, skilled labor, professional labor, white collar, blue collar, pink collar, manufacturing, service, agriculture.  (See a prior posting for an effort along these lines.)  And we might consider whether some of these groupings have the cohesion and sociological interconnectedness to constitute a \"class\".   Are unionized, blue-collar, industrial workers a \"class\"?  Are non-unionized service workers a class?  Are accountants, architects, and engineers a social class?  Are nurses and other healthcare workers a class?  Are mid-sized family farmers a social class?  And for that matter, are the owners and top managers of banks, investment companies, and financial firms a class?  These are fruitful questions, and they begin in a recognition of the complex occupational structure of the U.S. economy.  Occupations have large impact on worldview, values, quality of life, and political behavior.Second, there is certainly a great deal of persistent social stratification in the U.S.   The probability of a child's remaining in the quintile of the income distribution where his parents found themselves is high; so the position of a family within the distributive system is fairly stable over time.  And position within the income distribution has major consequences for a family's level of consumption and quality of life.  Being persistently \"near-poor\" is a situation of deprivation and insecurity that is sharply different from the life situation of the moderately affluent.  So we might  consider several large social groups based on income -- the extremely poor, the working poor,  the middle-income, the rich, and the super-rich.  Within each of these categories of society defined by income we are likely to find some characteristic features of lifestyle, values, and existential dilemmas.  So the basic structure of stratification of social goods such as income, health status, and education might serve to define large social \"classes.\"Third, it would appear that there are clusters of values, styles, and mental frameworks that correspond to different economic segments of American society.  This is the cultural dimension of the social reality of class.  Patterns of use of leisure time, attitudes towards education, membership in different kinds of civic organizations, and attitudes towards other nations seem to distinguish social groups in America.  So we might attempt to delineate social classes on the basis of clusters of values and mental frameworks.  And this approach can certainly be approached empirically, through administration of instruments such as the World Values Survey and domestic equivalents.  To what extent do studies like these demonstrate significant inter-group differences within the United States?Fourth, it seems likely that there are differentiating patterns among various social groups based on the patterns of social relationships that exist within the group, that would be revealed by maps of social networks.  And it seems probable that the distinct groups that emerge will have important economic relationships in common.  (Here is an interesting slide presentation by Valdis Krebs that illustrates some suggestive applications of social network analysis.)   Here is a hypothetical study that couldn't really be performed but may be interesting as a thought experiment.  Suppose we ask everyone in an urban population for the names of 5 non-family members upon whom they could call in an emergency to perform an important favor.  Now draw the network map that results from this survey.  Are there \"islands\" of separate sub-populations that can be discovered, where the great majority of links fall within the island and only a small number extend across to another island?  And are these islands related in some important way to economic situation and status of the individuals who are included?   Would this study map out groups that could be identified as \"social classes\"?  It seems likely that the answers to these questions are affirmative.Each of these is a different starting-place for a sociological analysis of social class in America.  And if the theory of class is correct, we would expect that these different starting places would begin to converge around the same large social formations: occupations, incomes, cultures, and social networks may all call out the same large social groups.Ultimately, the theory of class has to do with collective interests.  We might say that the fundamental interests of a group involve income, job security, healthcare, opportunities, and pensions.  A more intangible set of interests have to do with a demand for fair treatment in economic decision-making and a need for a sense of self-determination.  And it is plain that there are business decisions and public policy decisions that are being made today that affect these interests very differently for different groups.  This suggests that there are in fact large groups in American society whose members have shared interests with each other and who can be mobilized in political action in support of these interests.  And this begins to suggest that class remains a social reality in America -- and one that may become more politically salient rather than less in the coming decade or so.What cannot be forgotten, though, is the fact that economic structures are only one aspect of the social mechanisms of distribution and control through which individuals' status is determined.  The mechanisms of race, ethnicity, migration, and gender all affect individuals' core interests in ways that are somewhat independent from the structures of property and class we've been highlighting.  And this has important consequences for political mobilization as well; it means that political affinities and action may be organized around race and ethnicity as readily as they are around wage labor and capital -- witness the massive immigration rallies that took place in 2007, pictured above in the third image."}, {"title": "A diagram of class structure", "date": "Saturday, December 20, 2008", "text": "Consider this schematic representation of several variables defined by circumstances of work, income, and occupation. The diagram proposes a classification of income earners according to a series of distinctions about their economic situation.The diagram captures a handful of separate dimensions of a person's economic location -- one's class.  These include:source of income (profits, wages, partner's shares)level of skill and educationfunction as manager or staffincome level (high, medium, low)sector of economy (manufacturing, service, agriculture)These are important economic characteristics that serve to define a person's status, quality of life, and opportunities in American society. (All but income are designated in the dashed boxes on the diagram.)We might hypothesize that the large groups that are defined by this diagram have the makings of a class: unskilled farm laborers; unskilled industrial workers; skilled salaried industrial professionals; skilled salaried professors, teachers, and librarians; professionals in firms with partner status and income; and owners of property. Moreover, we are led to ask whether there are likely to be linkages across sectors: are unskilled farm workers and factory workers likely to see themselves as members of a large class? Are salaried professionals in the industrial sector and the service sector likely to have affinity with each other? What about salaried accountants and their counterparts in partner-governed firms? What about salaried professors and temporary instructors?Each of these categories of classification makes a difference in one's life circumstances. The source of income defines a basic set of interests for the members of each group; for example, owners of industrial firms have an economic interest in reducing labor costs, whereas wage and salaried workers have an interest in increasing salaries and benefits. The criterion of skill and education influences one's productivity and value to the employer; and it highlights an abstract social resource that one owns (specialized knowledge). The category of \"manager/staff\" defines the individual's power and influence within the workplace -- whether he/she is a \"boss\" or a \"worker\". The sector one works in makes a difference because it establishes a set of distinctive characteristics of the workplace (a factory is different from a factory farm), and it locates the individual's fortunes within a part of the economy that itself has specific interests and advantages. (More free trade is good for farmers because it boosts grain exports, but bad for industrial workers because it creates more competition around labor costs.)It is also worth pointing out that the diagram provides a crude theory of income distribution: incomes are higher for more skilled workers, for executives, managers, and supervisors, and in more productive industries.What the diagram leaves out are social characteristics like race, ethnicity, or gender, that substantially influence where one will end up within this structure. And it is intriguing to consider whether there might be a similar diagram that plots out the workings of race, immigration status, gender, or ethnicity in life outcomes."}, {"title": "Causal difference", "date": "Friday, December 19, 2008", "text": "Source: Federica Russo, Causality and Causal Modelling in the Social Sciences, p. 164I've recently read a very interesting recent book by Federica Russo, Causality and Causal Modelling in the Social Sciences: Measuring Variations (Methodos Series) on the philosophical issues that arise in causal reasoning about social phenomena.  Russo is obviously a talented and dedicated philosopher, and the book is a highly interesting contribution.Explanation is at the center of scientific research, and explanation almost always involves the discovery of causal relations among factors, conditions, or events.  This is true in the social sciences no less than in the natural sciences. But social causes look quite a bit different from causes of natural phenomena.  They result from the choices and actions of numerous individuals rather than fixed natural laws, and the causal pathways that link antecedents to consequents are less exact than those linking gas leaks to explosions.  Here as elsewhere, the foundational issues are different in the social sciences; so a central challenge for the philosophy of social science is to give a good, compelling account of causal reasoning about social phenomena that does justice to the research problems faced by social scientists.  Federica Russo has done so in this book. The book focuses on probabilistic causation and causal modeling, and Russo offers a rigorous and accessible treatment of the full range of current debates. Her central goal is to shed more light on the methods of causal modeling, and she succeeds admirably in this ambition. Causality and Causal Modelling in the Social Sciences makes an important and original contribution.Her approach to problems in the methodology and philosophy of social science is what she calls the \u201cbottom-up\u201d approach.  She works from careful analysis of specific examples of social science reasoning about causation, and works upward to more general analytical findings about causal reasoning as it actually works in the hands of skilled social scientists.  She uses five concrete case studies as a vehicle for teasing out the logic of causal inference that is at work: smoking and lung cancer, mother's education and child survival, health and wealth in a population, farmers' migration patterns, and factors causing job satisfaction.  She looks at the causal arguments advanced in studies in each of these areas as a way of discovering some of the fundamental logical features of causal inference.  The examples are drawn from a wider range of the social and behavioral sciences than is usually the case -- demography, public health, and migration, for example.  Her insight is that we can learn a great deal about social science research by looking at good examples of empirical and theoretical reasoning about social changes.  I think this is exactly right: it is much better to discover the problems that percolate out of the practice of social inquiry rather than imposing a framework of philosophical expectations onto social science practice.Russo focuses her attention on the problem of explaining variation: what causes the variation of a certain characteristic over a population of individuals or events.  This focus on \u201cvariation\u201d rather than \u201cregularity\u201d is very convincing; it provides an appropriate and insightful alternative approach to framing problems for social science research and explanation.  She offers a very adept discussion and interpretation of the meaning of causal statements and causal reasoning in the social sciences.  The book provides a rigorous contribution to the large literature on the logic of quantitative reasoning about causes of population characteristics.  Her case studies are well selected and well done.  The book is founded on a deep and rigorous understanding of the most recent philosophical and methodological work on causal modeling.The author does a very good job of positioning her understanding of the meaning of causal modeling and causal judgments in the social sciences.  She honestly addresses the position of \u201ccausal realism\u201d and the view that good explanations depend on discovering or hypothesizing causal mechanisms underlying the phenomena.  Her chapter on causal mechanisms is a significant contribution to this growing debate within the philosophy of social science; she correctly observes that we need to have greater precision in our discussion of what a causal mechanism is supposed to be.The book will be of substantial interest to the social scientists, psychologists, demographers, and philosophers who are interested in current debates about the mathematics and philosophy of causal inference.  Social scientists and philosophers such as Skyrms, Cartwright, Woodward, Pearl, and Lieberson have developed a very deep set of controversies and debates about the proper interpretation of causal inference.  Russo\u2019s book is a substantial contribution to these debates and will engage much the same audiences."}, {"title": "The sociology of class", "date": "Thursday, December 18, 2008", "text": "According to the traditional definition, a class is defined in relation to the broad structure of the property system.  A group of people belong to the same class when they occupy the same position within the property system governing labor, physical assets, and perhaps intangible assets such as knowledge or money.  This is a structural definition of the concept of class.  In nineteenth-century France we might have classified the population into land owners, capital owners, wage laborers, artisans, professionals (accountants, architects), intellectuals, government officials, civil service workers, small merchants, smallholding farmers, tenant farmers, landless workers, and lumpenproletariat.  And these groups can be roughly triangulated according to their ownership of three major elements: labor power, valuable skills and knowledge, and economic assets (land, property, wealth).Another way of putting the point is to ask: where does the individual gain his/her income -- from the sale of labor time, from the sale or rent of physical assets, or from the sale or rent of expertise?  Workers derive their income from the sale of their labor time; capitalists, financiers, and landlords derive their income from their ownership of physical and financial resources, and professionals, experts, and intellectuals derive their income from their possession of scarce expert knowledge and skills.  (That's Pierre-Joseph Proudhon pictured above by Courbet, an intellectual in artisanal garb.)So we might capture nineteenth-century French social reality from this point of view along these lines:Of course, things can be classified according to any principle we might offer.  So the value of a particular classification must be justified in terms of the explanatory or causal work that it does.  The explanatory thrust of the theory of class goes along the lines of a sociological hypothesis: people who have a similar location within a system of property relations will also develop other important similarities: similarities of thought, values, style, behavior, and politics, for example.  And so Marx believed that structurally-defined classes of people were likely to further develop a similar class consciousness -- a similar framework of thought in terms of which they understand the social forces around them; and he expected that classes of people would come to share a signature framework of political motivation -- a set of ideas, interpretations, and values that would motivate them to engage in collective action together.This is where the substantive sociology of class comes in; in order to provide credibility for this set of expectations about class consciousness and political motivation, we need to have some ideas about the concrete sociological mechanisms that might plausibly lead from \"common position in the property relations\" to \"common forms of consciousness and political motivation.\" And here there are quite a few things that can be said -- both by Marx in the 1850s and contemporary observers in the 2000s.  First, a common position in the property relations often implies a number of concrete similarities of experience across individuals -- common features of the workplace, common neighborhoods in cities, common experiences in the system of schooling that is in place.  These kinds of shared social positions suggest two things: first, a common process of shaping through which perceptions and motivations develop in each individual; and second, a common reality that individuals who experience these environments are likely to be able to perceive.  It is highly plausible that a group of men and women who have spent their lives in a nineteenth century textile factory while living in a concentrated workers' slum, will have developed a similar consciousness and social style from the discipline and work processes of the factory and their shared social associations in their neighborhoods.So miners in Wales or northern Michigan are exposed to similar work environments; similar firms and styles of management; and similar life outcomes that might be expected to create a \"miner's consciousness\" and a miner's political mentality.  Smallholding wine growers across the landscape of nineteenth century France are exposed to similar natural, social, and economic circumstances that are likely to shape the development of their personalities and worldviews, that are in turn likely to create an ideal-typical \"wine grower\" who fairly accurately represents the worldview and behavior of wine growers.Second, there is a fact that is more apparent today than it was to nineteenth-century sociological observers, that has to do with what we now understand about social networks and social capital.  Common locations of work and residence make it highly likely that occupational groups (miners, architects, professors) will fall within sharply distinguished sets of social networks, and they will have access to different combinations of social capital (civic organizations, religious groups, secret societies).  And the consciousness and political behavior of an individual is surely influenced in very profound ways by each of these social categories -- networks and social capital.  So the fact of similarities in these respects is likely to give rise to similarities in consciousness and action as well.And, of course, there is the fact of the social reality of exploitation in each of these circumstances: miners and wine growers are subject to coercive social relations that succeed in separating them from a substantial portion of the fruits of their labors.  Coal miners will identify the profit-driven mine owners as the source of their exploitation and wine growers may identify the wine jobbers who buy their product cheaply and sell it dearly in the cities as the source of their exploitation.  But each group comes to recognize the social reality of the property relations through which their productive labor is \"expropriated\" by other powerful forces.  Recognition of the fact of exploitation is a key component of the process of the formation of class consciousness.So it seems plausible to suppose that there are identifiable social mechanisms through which occupational groups come to have shared worldviews and similar political behaviors.  But the theory of class asserts more than this; it asserts that wage laborers in many occupations will come to recognize themselves as fundamentally similar to workers in other occupations.  The theory of class postulates a sociology of \"escalation\" of class identity, from the particular occupation, work group, and neighborhood to the larger (and more abstract) class that encompasses many occupations and work groups in widely separated locations.  So, it is postulated, fast food workers, auto workers, and air traffic controllers will come to identify together, not simply as a set of occupational groups, but as an extended group of \"persons who are forced to sell their labor to capital in order to satisfy life needs.\"  And, further, the theory postulates that it will be possible for a strong form of group solidarity to emerge across this fairly heterogeneous and physically separated set of occupational groups.It isn't entirely clear what the sociological mechanisms are supposed to be that facilitate this escalation of class identity, however.  Classical Marxism depends heavily on the idea of a party and a group of activists who do the \"class education\" that leads workers from a narrowly parochial view of their situation to one that encompasses the common situation of wage labor. But this depends on a fairly sizable historical coincidence -- the emergence of a militant and disciplined class-based party.  And it is very hard to see how non-planned forms of sociological change might lead to this escalation -- hard to see, that is, how air traffic controllers, McDonalds workers, and steel workers might spontaneously come to regard each other as belonging to a single class subject to exploitation by another abstractly defined class.Moreover, it is very apparent today that there are multiple axes around which collective identities can form.  Kinship relations in southern China cut across structural class relations, and it is certainly possible that the Li clan will have a stronger sense of identity than the landless workers -- even though the Li clan contains both landlords, peasant farmers, and landless workers.  Religious affinities may be mobilized as a source of collective identity -- again, with the likelihood of creating groups that cut across class lines.So this line of thought suggests that there is a fairly large gap in the theory of class in even its application to the nineteenth-century case: the problem of how to explain the postulated escalation of consciousness from the particular work group and occupation to the more general category, \"working class.\"This leaves for another posting the most important question: to what extent is the theory of class relevant to 21st-century society?  To what extent can American political conflicts, perceptions, parties, and movements be explained on the basis of occupational and class identities?  To what extent do the most important fissures in our society derive from economic conflicts that can be assimilated to the theory of class?"}, {"title": "Power and class in the 21st century", "date": "Friday, December 12, 2008", "text": "We could say that power and class are the two most important determinants of everyday life in the 21st century. Class relations \u2013 determined by the property system and the basic economic institutions within which we live \u2013 determine our opportunities, health, quality of life, and sometimes our basic freedoms. Power relations influence our careers, our opportunities, our freedoms, and very basic aspects of our behavior and choice. It is reasonable to think that the system of power and class within which we live constitutes the basic framework within which our lives and purposes unfold.Further, the two schemata of post-modern life are interrelated. The property system within which we live is like a medieval cathedral \u2013 it cannot stand without the buttresses of power that retain its structure in the face of countervailing pressures. And the relations of power that exist in a society often derive much of their voltage from the structure of property that exists. Property holders need, want, and gain power; holders of power gain property.But post-modern life is not so simple. There are multiple cross-cutting identities and positions that influence personal outcomes, not simply class or power. Race, ethnic group, gender \u2013 these are social systems that have quite a bit in common with class, and they have relationships to power as well. Race, ethnicity, and gender are also \u201csocial processing systems\u201d \u2013 one\u2019s status within the system of race or gender immediately influences one\u2019s opportunities, status, prestige, and \u2013 yes, power. And one\u2019s position within these ascriptive systems also has implications for the class system; thus black workers faced a different working environment than white workers in the Detroit auto industry in the 1950s and 1960s, and female workers earn less than male workers in many businesses.We might define power in these terms: \"access to social and material resources that permit an individual or group to control or influence social outcomes, including the behavior of other individuals and groups, the distribution of things, and the configuration of social institutions.\" And we can give a simple schematic description of the chief mechanisms and tactics through which control and influence are exercised in contemporary society: coercion, threat, manipulation of the agenda, manipulation of information and thought, and positional advantage.  These are almost all relational characteristics -- they have to do with the relationships of influence that exist among individuals and groups.We can also provide a simple definition of social class: \u201cposition within a system of property relations, defining one\u2019s location with a structure of domination, control, and exploitation.\u201d  The group of people who share a similar position within the property relations of a society constitute a class.  Their circumstances, resources, and opportunities are similar to those of others in the class, and they have common interests that are in opposition to members of some other classes.  So class works as a social sorting process: individuals are tracked into one class or another through specific sociological mechanisms (schooling, parental attitudes, neighborhood).  And it works to assign very different ranges of material outcomes to members of the various groups; working class families wind up more poorly educated, less healthy, and more vulnerable to economic fluctuations than their counterparts in the landlord class, the financial elite class, or the capitalist class.  Part of the challenge of developing a sociology of class involved identifying some of the concrete pathways of difference created by class with respect to specific opportunities \u2013 education, health, adequate nutrition, access to creative work, .\u2026Status and consciousness are also part of the sociology of class.  Individuals develop specific features of mentality out of the experience they have in the class environments of their parents, their schools, and their workplaces.  And these differences in turn give rise to differences in behavior -- consumer behavior, political behavior, and inter-group behavior.  And members of a class may acquire a common perspective on their situation -- they may come to diagnose the social relations around them in a similar way, they may come to a common \"class consciousness\" that leads them to engage in collective action together.Further, the system of class relations also creates specific features in the social networks that exist in a society.  A highly democratic and egalitarian society would be expected to have a social network graph that is widely and evenly distributed across the population.  But in our society, it is likely that a social network map of Chicago would be highly differentiated along class lines: business people tend to know business people, manufacturing workers tend to know other manufacturing workers, and so forth.  (I am sure there is some good research on this topic, though I can't put my hands on it.)  This in turn implies that there will be significant differences across classes with respect to social capital -- the ability of people to call upon their social relationships and associations in pursuit of their goals and interests. (See Nan Lin, Social Capital: Theory and Research.)  (This point comes up in a different context in the earlier posting about segregation in France.)The concepts of power and class are often linked.  However, it strikes me that the two concepts or theories are not parallel; they do different work within our analysis of the society in which we live, and they require different kinds of ontologies in order for us to explicate them. \u201cClass\u201d is a situational feature for individuals; it defines a set of circumstances and opportunities that fundamentally influence the shape of their lives.  In this respect the theory of class evokes structures first and agency and consciousness second. \u201cPower\u201d is a fluid characteristic of individuals within social relationships.  As such, it evokes social relationships and social resources wielded by individuals and groups against other individuals and groups. \u201cPower\u201d is a feature of the individual's position within a set of social networks and relationships, not a social structure.  Class is more akin to \"the mass of the earth\", whereas power is akin to \"the ability to fly\".  The mass of the earth determines the most basic feature of life on earth -- gravity.  The ability to fly is a complex and variable capacity that permits specific organisms and artifacts to accomplish flight within the general influence of gravity.  What is complicated about this analogy is the fact that there are several sources of social \"gravity\" -- including the structures of race, gender, and religion that pull, push, and constrain us in multiple directions.It is obvious that maps are selective representations of the world. They represent an abstraction: a representation of a complex, dense reality that signifies some characteristics while deliberately ignoring other aspects. The principles of selection used by the cartographer are highly dependent on the expected interests of the user. Topography will be relevant to the hiker but not the motorist. Location of points of interest will be important to the tourist but not the long-distance trucker. Location of railroad hubs will be valued by the military planner but not the birdwatcher. So there is no such thing as a comprehensive map -- one that represents all geographical details; and there is also no such thing as a truly \"all-purpose\" map -- one that includes all the details that any user could want.We also know that there are different schemes of representation of geography -- different projections, different conventions for representing items and relationships, etc. So there is no objectively best map of a given terrain. Rather, comparing maps for adequacy, accuracy, and usefulness requires semantic and pragmatic comparison. (Here the word \"semantic\" is used in a specialized sense: \"having to do with the reference relationship between a sign and the signified.\") Semantically, we are interested in the correspondence between the map and the world. The conventions of a given cartography imply a specific set of statements about the spatial relations that actually exist among places, as well as denoting a variety of characteristics of places. So there is a perfectly natural question to ask of a given map: is it representationally accurate? This sort of assessment leads to judgments like these: This map does a more accurate job of representing driving distances than that one, given the rules of representation that each presupposes. This map errs in representing the relative population sizes of Cleveland and Peoria. These are features that have to do with the accuracy of the correspondence between the map and the world.The pragmatic considerations have to do with how well the representation or its underlying conventions conform to how various people want to use it. Maps are particularly dependent on pragmatic considerations. We need to assess the value of a map with respect to a set of practical interests.  How well does the map convey the information about places and spatial relationships that the user will want to consult?  How have the judgments about what to include and what to exclude worked out from the point of view of the user?  Pragmatic considerations lead to judgments like these: this mapping convention corresponds better to the needs of the military planner or the public health official than that one. The pragmatic questions about a map have to do with a different kind of fit -- fit between the features and design of the map and the practical interests of a particular set of users. Do the conventions of the given cartography correspond well to the interests that specific sets of users have in the map?Here is the point of this discussion: are there useful analogies between the epistemology of maps and the cognitive situation of other representational constructs -- for example, historical narratives and scientific theories? Several points of parallel seem particularly evident. First, narratives and theories are selective too. It is impossible to incorporate every element of a historical event or natural process into a theory or narrative; rather, it is necessary to select a storyline that permits us to provide a partial account of what happened. This is true for the French Revolution; but it is also true for the trajectory of a hockey puck.Second, there is a parallel point about veridicality that applies to narratives and theories as much as to maps. No map stands as an isolated representation; rather, it is embedded within a set of conventions of representation. We must apply the conventions in order to discover what \"assertions\" are contained in the representation. So maps are in an important sense \"conventional.\" However, given the conventions of the map, we can undertake to evaluate its accuracy. And this is true for narratives and theories as well; we can attempt to assess the degree of approximate truth possessed by the construction. Are the statements about the nature of the events and their sequence approximately true? (Given that an account of the French Revolution singles out class interests of parties within the narrative, has the historian correctly described the economic interests of the Jacobins?)And third, the point about the relevance of users' interests to assessment of the construction seems pertinent to narratives and theories as well. The civil engineer who is investigating the collapse of a building will probably find a truthful analysis of the thermodynamics of the HVAC system unhelpful, even though it is true. The detective investigating a robbery of a party store will probably become impatient at a narrative that highlights the sequence of street noises that were audible during the heist, rather than the descriptions and actions of the visitors during the relevant time.When it comes to narratives and theories, there is another value dimension that we want to impose on the construction: the idea of explanatory adequacy. A narrative ought to provide a basis for explaining the \"how and why\" of historical events; it ought to single out the circumstances and reasoning that help to explain the actions of participants, and it ought to highlight some of the environmental circumstances that influenced the outcome. A scientific theory is intended to identify some of the fundamental causal factors that explain a puzzling phenomenon -- the turbulence that occurs in a pot of water as it approaches the boiling point, for example. So when we say that a narrative or a theory is an abstraction, part of what we're getting at is the idea that the historian or natural scientist has deliberately excluded factors that don't make a difference, in order to highlight a set of factors that do make a difference."}, {"title": "Comparative life satisfaction", "date": "Wednesday, December 10, 2008", "text": "We tend to think of the past century as being a time of great progress when it comes to the quality of life -- for ordinary people as well as the privileged. Advances in science, technology, and medicine have made life more secure, predictable, productive, educated, and healthy. But in what specific ways is ordinary life happier or more satisfying for ordinary people in 2000 compared to their counterparts in 1900 or 1800 -- or 200, for that matter?There are a couple of things that are pretty obvious. Nutrition is one place to start: the mass population of France, Canada, or the United States is not subject to periodic hunger, malnutrition, or famine. This is painfully not true for many poor parts of the world -- Sudan, Ethiopia, and Bangladesh, for example. But for the countries of the affluent world, the OECD countries, hunger has been largely conquered for most citizens.Second, major advances in health preservation and the treatment of illness have taken place. We know how to prevent cholera, and we know how to treat staph infections with antibiotics. Terrible diseases such as polio have been eradicated, and we have effective treatments for some kinds of previously incurable cancers. So the basic health status of people in the affluent 21st-century world is substantially better than that of previous centuries -- with obvious consequences for our ability to find satisfaction in life activities.These advances in food security and public health provision have resulted in a major enhancement to quality of life -- life expectancy in France, Germany, or Costa Rica has increased sharply. And many of the factors underlying much of this improvement is not high-tech, but rather takes the form of things like improvement of urban sanitation and relatively low-cost treatment (antibiotics for children's ear infections, for example).So living longer and more healthily is certainly an advantage in our quality of life relative to conditions one or two centuries ago.Improvements in labor productivity in agriculture and manufacturing have resulted in another kind of enhancement of modern quality of life. It is no longer necessary for a large percentage of humanity to perform endless and exhausting labor in order to feed the rest of us. And because of new technologies and high labor productivity, almost everyone has access to goods that extend the enjoyment of life and our creative talents. Personal computing and communications, access to the world's knowledge and culture through the Internet, and ability to travel widely all represent opportunities that even the most privileged could not match one or two centuries ago.But the question of life satisfaction doesn't reduce to an inventory of the gadgets we can use. Beyond the minimum required for sustaining a healthy human body, the question of satisfaction comes down to the issue of what we do with the tools and resources available to us and the quality of our human relationships. How do we organize our lives in such a way as to succeed in achieving goals that really matter?Amartya Sen's economic theory of \"capabilities and realizations\" supports a pretty good answer to these questions about life satisfaction (Development as Freedom). Each person has a bundle of talents and capabilities. These talents can be marshalled into a meaningful life plan. And the satisfying life is one where the person has singled out some important values and goals and has used his/her talents to achieve these goals. (This general idea underlies J. S. Mill's theory of happiness as well in Utilitarianism.)By this standard, it's not so clear that life in the twenty-first century is inherently more satisfying than that in the eighteenth or the second centuries. When basic needs were satisfied -- nutrition, shelter, health -- the opportunities for realizing one's talents in meaningful effort were no less extensive than they are today. This is true for the creative classes -- obviously. The creative product of Mill's or Hugo's generation was no less substantial or satisfying than our own. But perhaps it is true across the board. The farmer-gardener who shapes his/her land over the course of a lifetime has created something of great personal value and satisfaction. The mason or smith may have taken more pride and satisfaction in his life's work than does the programmer or airline flight attendant. The parent who succeeded in nurturing a family in 1800 County Cork may have found the satisfactions as great or greater than parents in Boston or Seattle today.So we might say that the only unmistakeable improvement in quality of life in the past century is in the basics -- secure nutrition, decent education, and improved health during the course of a human life. And the challenge of the present is to make something meaningful and sustaining of the resources we are given."}, {"title": "Contingent historical development", "date": "Tuesday, December 9, 2008", "text": "Here's a relatively limited historical puzzle to solve.  A powerful new technology -- the railroad -- was developed in the first part of the nineteenth century.  The nature and characteristics of the technology were essentially homogeneous across the national settings in which it appeared in Europe and North America.  However, it was introduced and built out in three countries -- the United States, Britain, and France -- in markedly different ways.  The ways in which the railroads and their technologies were regulated and encouraged were very different in the three countries, and the eventual rail networks had very different properties in the three countries.  The question for explanation is this: can we explain the differences in these three national experiences on the basis of some small set of structural or cultural differences that existed among the three countries and that causally explain the resulting differences in build-out, structure, and technical frameworks?  Or, possibly, are the three historical experiences different simply because of the occurrence of a large but cumulative number of unimportant and non-systemic events?These are the questions that historical sociologist Frank Dobbin poses in his book, Forging Industrial Policy: The United States, Britain, and France in the Railway Age.  He argues that there were significantly different cultures of political and industrial policy in the three countries that led to substantial differences in the ways in which government and business interacted in the development of the railroads. \"Each Western nation-state developed a distinct strategy for governing industry\" (1).  The laissez-faire culture of the United States permitted a few large railroad magnates and corporations to make the crucial decisions about technology, standards, and routes that would govern the development of the rail system.  The regulated market culture of Great Britain favored smaller companies and strove to prevent the emergence of a small number of oligopolistic rail companies.  And the technocratic civil-service culture of France gave a great deal of power to the engineers and civil servants who were charged to make decisions about technology choice, routes, and standards.These differences led to systemic differences in the historical implementation of the railroads, the rail networks that were developed, and the regulatory regimes that surrounded them.  The U.S. rail network developed as the result of competition among a small number of rail magnates for the most profitable routes.  This turned out to favor a few east-west trunk lines connecting urban centers, including New York, Boston, Chicago, and San Francisco.  The British rail network gave more influence to municipalities who demanded service; as a result, the network that developed was a more distributed one across a larger number of cities.  And the French rail network was rationally designed to conform to the economic and military needs of the French state, with a system of rail routes that largely centered on Paris.  These differences are evident in the maps at the top of the posting.This example illustrates the insights that can be distilled from comparative historical sociology.  Dobbin takes a single technology and documents a range of outcomes in the way in which the technology is built out into a national system.  And he attempts to isolate the differences in structures and cultures in the three settings that would account for the differences in outcomes.  He offers a causal analysis of the development of the technology in the three settings, demonstrating how the mechanism of policy culture imposes effects on the development of the technology.  The inherent possibilities represented by the technology intersect with the economic circumstances and the policy cultures of the three national settings, and the result is a set of differentiated organizations and outcomes in the three countries.  The analysis is rich in its documentation of the social mechanisms through which policy culture influenced technology development; the logic of his analysis is more akin to process tracing than to the methods of difference and similarity in Mill's methods.The research establishes several important things.  First, it refutes any sort of technological determinism, according to which the technical characteristics of the technology determine the way it will be implemented.  To the contrary, Dobbin's work demonstrates the very great degree of contingency that existed in the social implementation of the railroad.  Second, it makes a strong case for the idea that an element of culture -- the framework of assumptions, precedents, and institutions defining the \"policy culture\" of a country -- can have a very strong effect on the development of large social institutions.  Dobbin emphasizes the role that things like traditions, customs, and legacies play in the unfolding of important historical developments.  And finally, the work makes it clear that these highly contingent pathways of development nonetheless admit of explanation.  We can identify the mechanisms and local circumstances that led, in one instance, to a large number of firms and hubs and in the other, a small number of firms and trunk lines.What is objectivity in social science?  What might be meant by the claim that a given theory represents an objective scientific analysis of a range of social phenomena?  Debate over the objectivity of social science has often combined a variety of separate theses:There are social facts that are independent of the concepts and theories of the scientist which the theory is intended to uncover--that is, that there is an objective social world.  (ontological objectivity)It is possible for a theory of a given range of social facts to be well-grounded on the basis of the right sorts of reasons (empirical and theoretical adequacy).  (epistemic objectivity)Social facts are independent of the states of consciousness of participants.Scientific inquiry can be value-free and interest-neutral.Scientific inquiry tends to converge around a consensus among all researchers over the properties of the world as a result of further empirical and theoretical research.Thesis (1) contradicts conceptual relativism.  Thesis (2) contradicts a family of underdetermination arguments within the philosophy of science.  Thesis (3) divides materialist social science from interpretation theory and verstehen sociology.  Thesis (4) upholds the position that it is possible to exclude value commitments from the conduct of science.  And thesis (5) asserts that science progresses towards a higher degree of agreement among researchers.We may dispense quickly with (4).  It is unquestionably true that scientific research is interest-relative: what particular features of the social system, what aspects of action, and what causal processes, are selected for scrutiny and explanation, are dependent on the interests--both intellectual and moral--of the investigator.  Further, it is plain that scientific reasoning presupposes a set of normative commitments--for example, to the primacy of empirical evidence over religious authority.  But Weber's treatment of this issue is convincing; these points do not diminish the objectivity of science in \"'Objectivity' in Social Science\" (The Methodology Of The Social Sciences).  Once having defined the program of research, it is still possible to arrive at an objective analysis of the subject matter.Thesis (1) represents a general metaphysical view of the social world, in that it asserts the mind-independence of various kinds of social processes, structures, etc.  Scientific researc attempts to identify underlying processes, structures, mechanisms, and the like, whose properties explain the observable data.  This goal presupposes that social phenomena are the result of a set of causally ordered, objective social processes which the social scientist can discover and map out.  (Call this the realism component.)  (It might be noted that (1) does not commit one to methodological holism.  The objective social facts referred to may well supervene upon facts about individual actions.)Thesis (2) represents the view that scientific theories are put forward as being justified on the basis of a \"scientific method\" and not simply personal advocacy, political bias, or one's value perspective.  There need to be objective procedures in terms of which to compare competing theories and to provide empirical and logical arguments favoring one such theory over its competitors.  (Call this the justification component.)Thesis (5) represents the view that scientific inquiry progresses towards consensus among members of a given research community, and that this consensus is best explained on the hypothesis that the consensus theory is true, and has been arrived at through reliable procedures of scientific inquiry.  (Bernard Williams describes this view briefly in Ethics and the Limits of Philosophy, chapter 8.)Various combinations of these components of objectivity in social science are possible.  For example, Weber appears to affirm (1) and hold that there are social facts; he denies (3), asserting that these facts are \"subjective\" in the sense that they depend essentially on the states of mind of the persons whose meaningful behavior constitutes them; and he accepts (2), holding that it is possible to offer theoretically and empirically well-grounded descriptions of these facts (Weber, Methodology, chapter 2).  Nelson Goodman appears to contradict (1), maintaining that there are as many social worlds as there are schemes of concepts in terms of which to organize and describe experience (Ways of Worldmaking).  Such a view is forced to reject (2) as well, since it maintains that there is no uniquely best theory of the world.  It would be possible to reject (1) while maintaining (2)--that is, to hold that there is a best social scientific theory of a given range of social phenomena, but deny that such a theory describes an independently existing set of social facts.  (For example, Hilary Putnam's anti-realist arguments might illustrate this combination.)The form of objectivity of social science that I want to defend affirms (1) and (2).  Concerning thesis (3), I hold that there is no need to choose between \"material\" and \"subjective\" features of the social world.  Some social facts may be constituted by the meanings attributed to them by participants, while others may be meaning-independent.  And finally, I maintain that the procedures internal to various social science disciplines are sufficient to produce the sort of convergence of theoretical beliefs described in thesis (5) in most concrete historical and social science debates."}, {"title": "Why \"philosophy of social science\"?", "date": "Monday, December 8, 2008", "text": "Source: The Frankfurt SchoolThe subject of the philosophy of social science is important but poorly understood. The field considers the most foundational questions about the possibility of scientific knowledge about the social world. What are the scope and limits of scientific knowledge of society? What is involved in arriving at a scientific understanding of society? What are the most appropriate standards for judging proffered social explanations? A philosophy can guide us as we construct a field of knowledge, and it can serve as a set of regulative standards as we conduct and extend that field of knowledge. Philosophy has served both intellectual functions in the past century or two.The importance of the philosophy of social science derives from two things: first, the urgency and complexity of the challenges posed by the poorly understood social processes that surround us in twenty-first century society, and second, the unsettled status of our understanding of the logic of social science knowledge and explanation. It is as if we were passengers on a technologically complex spacecraft whose propulsion and life support systems we do not fully understand; and further, we have only a limited understanding of the systems of science and engineering on the basis of which these technologies were designed and maintained. We would have a very lively interest in learning the science that explains the workings of the technologies, and in learning the limitations and areas of uncertainty that the relevant sciences include. Likewise, it is important for us to come to a better and more well-grounded understanding of the social, political, and behavioral phenomena that constitute the modern social world. And there are large and unresolved philosophical questions about the logic of social science knowledge and theory on the basis of which to arrive at that understanding.Contemporary philosophies of social science have focused primarily on contemporary, \u201cmature\u201d social science research and theory. However, philosophies of social science were also relevant in the emergence of the social sciences in the nineteenth century, as idealized schemata for setting the scientific goals that the founders set for themselves. Philosophical ideas about the nature of knowledge and the nature of the social world guided or influenced the founding efforts by such early social researchers as Weber, Durkheim, or Spencer in the formulation of their highest-level assumptions about social processes and their most general assumptions about what a scientific treatment of society ought to look like. So there has been an important back-and-forth between philosophy and the social sciences from the start.It is useful to attempt to reconstruct the guiding assumptions about the \"scientific study of society\" that were in the minds of the founders of the social science disciplines and the several generations of philosophers who shaped so much of our current understanding of social science; to expose some of the chief contemporary problems in social science inquiry and explanation today; and to show how this line of intellectual development also suggests some new ways of thinking about social science research and theorizing. The goal is to treat the philosophy of social science, not simply as a sub-discipline of philosophy, but as an active and guiding area of intellectual work intimately bound up in the development of the social sciences.Philosophy, then, played an active role in the intellectual work done by the creators of sociology as they attempted to frame a \"science of society\" in the nineteenth and early twentieth century (Durkheim, Weber, Marx, the Chicago school of sociology, and the first generation of ethnographers). And I believe we can learn a great deal about how better to understand the contemporary world by attempting to identify the leading assumptions about social scientific knowledge held by the founders of the social sciences. What assumptions about social science knowledge were held by the philosophers who initiated the field, including Comte, Mill, Spencer, and others? How did the development of theories of the \"human sciences\" within the continental tradition of hermeneutics relate to positivist theories of the social sciences from the Vienna Circle through Popper, Hempel, and Nagel? How did the praxis philosophy of the Frankfurt School change some of the ways we think about the social sciences?The leading philosophical ideas that have been applied to the social sciences emerged out of these early efforts to make sense of the social world: for example, positivism, naturalism, realism, hermeneutics, individualism, holism, reductionism, falsifiability, materialism, verstehen methodology, feminist epistemology, and causal explanation. Reflection on the leading ideas about the \"what and how\" of social scientific knowledge will also give us an idea of some of the rethinking that needs to occur in the way that we think about the social sciences in the modern world.A better understanding of the nature and logic of the social sciences has great practical importance. Just think of the complexity and magnitude of the processes that have been underway in the past fifty years: rapid change in youth culture, ethnic hatred and conflict, full incorporation of most countries into the global economy, terrorism, the emergence of East Asia as a manufacturing super power, population movements, the re-emergence of significant social inequalities within and across countries, new social networks created by the internet, and so on. And these processes are not well understood. We do not have comprehensive theories for which these contemporary processes are a special case\u2014whether \u201cmodernization theory,\u201d \u201cworld systems theory,\u201d \u201crational choice theory,\u201d or \u201ctheory of exploitation.\u201dIn fact, it is a radical misunderstanding of the nature of the social, to imagine that there might be such theories. Rather, social change is a contingent, multi-threaded social congeries of behavior, institutions, and contingent events, and no single set of comprehensive theories can be expected to explain all these phenomena. These changes are as deep, rapid, and perplexing as those associated with the process of industrialization in nineteenth-century England\u2014and consider how profoundly the experience of Manchester and Birmingham stimulated new sociological thinking in the hands of Engels, Tocqueville, Marx, and the other founders of modern western sociology. So the complexity and opacity of the contemporary social world demands a better understanding of the logic and methods of the social sciences."}, {"title": "Historical populations", "date": "Sunday, December 7, 2008", "text": "Historical demography concerns itself with two families of questions -- factual description of population behavior and explanation of the patterns that are observed. On the descriptive side, historical demographers are concerned with estimating the absolute population size of a group or region -- Tuscany in 1400, New England in 1700, the Anasazi in 1000. And they are interested in measuring the underlying demographic rates -- for example, natality, mortality, age of marriage, nutritional and health status, or sex ratios.And, to make useful comparisons, these measurements need to be linked to the same variables over time and comparable populations over the same time period. This set of observations permits the discovery of trends and patterns -- steady population growth in group A simultaneous with flat population size in group B; high rate of growth for C during 1700-1750 followed by slow growth in the next 50 years; high population density in agricultural region D compared with low density in agricultural region E.The descriptive task is a difficult one. But it immediately raises a host of explanatory questions.   What are the social mechanisms that conjoin to bring about the complex observed demographic outcomes?  Population outcomes are the result of myriad choices by anonymous individuals; and yet the outcomes are highly patterned.  The task of explanation arises when we try to make sense of the demographic behavior and outcomes that are discovered. What are the material and social circumstances that explain the trends we observe and the differences that emerge across populations?Thomas Malthus offered an explanation of large population trends based on both material and social factors: the food-production capacity of the land inhabited and the norms and institutions regulating family formation and child-bearing. Malthus's theories suggest relating population size and growth rates to measures of economic prosperity -- for example, measures of the real wage for farm laborers over time, measures of the fluctuations in availability of jobs, or measures of available land per unit of population. The classic Malthusian argument predicts that population growth will lag economic fluctuation: rising wages encourage higher fertility and falling wages discourage fertility. And if population continues to rise in declining economic circumstances, then eventually mortality will rise -- again suppressing population growth.Source: Massimo Livi Bacci, A Concise History of World Population, P. 70.The simple Malthusian theory, then, postulates that population expands to the limit created by available sources of food.  So increases in farm productivity and increases in arable land should give rise to an increase in population, whereas a rising population density on a given territory will eventually lead to the \"negative\" checks of famine and nutrition-based mortality if not pre-empted by the preventive checks of reduced natality.The question of scale, both temporal and regional, makes a large difference in the explanatory quest. We can frame the question of group demographic behavior from the micro- to the macro-levels -- from a handful of Alpine villages in the 16th century (population 5000) to the Yangzi delta in the 18th century (population 300 million). Micro-trends may have a different explanations than macro-trends.It might be maintained that the Malthusian theory is only well-suited to the largest scale: large territory and long timeframe. In the longterm it is almost tautological to observe that a population will expand to the limits created by environmental resources. But long before those limits are approached, there is ample space for the workings of social arrangements to modulate population behavior. Alternative economic and demographic institutions create different demographic profiles. Birth spacing (reflecting family choices and cultural values) can dramatically influence total fertility. Technologies of birth control -- both traditional and modern -- can move a population from high-fertility to medium- or low-fertility.  So historical demography requires social explanation based on discovery of concrete and specific institutions in local circumstances, not simply broad-brush hypotheses about resource limits.Recent studies of population behavior across the expanse of Eurasia confirm this point.  The Eurasian Demography Project finds that there is a wide range of demograhic patterns across the locales of Eurasia, from Finland to Italy to China to Japan. And the Malthusian picture works only at the coarsest level; in particular, it turns out that the Chinese population did not teeter on the edge of Malthusian crisis.(See Eurasian Historical Comparisons for more on the Eurasian Demography Project.)"}, {"title": "A range of causal questions", "date": "Thursday, December 4, 2008", "text": "In considering important issues in the philosophy of the special sciences, I think it is always helpful to consider a variety of the kinds of intellectual challenges that arise in the area.  This gives the philosopher something to work with -- not simply an apriori specification of an issue, but a nuanced set of examples. So if we are interested in causal reasoning in the social sciences, we ought to pay attention to the kinds of causal questions that social scientists actually want to answer.  Let's consider a range of causal questions that have arisen within historical and comparative sociology.  In considering these examples, we should reflect on the types of analysis that would provide a satisfactory response to the question, and also the modes of research that would support an empirical response to the question.What causes ethnic violence (Horowitz 1985)?What caused ethnic violence in Rwanda?What caused twentieth-century revolutions (Wolf 1969)?What caused the Nicaraguan revolution?Why did revolution unfold as it did in the Canton Delta in 1911 (Hsieh 1974)?What factors enhance the likelihood of successful democratization (Przeworski 1991; Przeworski et al. 1996)?What causes urban residential segregation (Schelling 1978)?What causes political corruption (Klitgaard 1988)?What factors explain the success or failure of anti-corruption reforms (Klitgaard 1988)?What factors explain the East Asian economic miracle (Vogel 1991)?Why are there more violent crimes per 1000 in the US than Western Europe?Why was the political party of labor more successful in the UK than the US (Przeworski 1985)?Why is infant mortality significantly lower in Sri Lanka than Brazil or Egypt (Dr\u00e8ze and Sen 1989, 1995)?Why do millenarian cults occur in the post-colonial world (Adas 1979)?Why was agricultural technology stagnant in late imperial China (Elvin 1973)?Why are rural people more politically conservative than urban people?  Why do social tastes and styles change as they do (Lieberson 2000)?Why did the name \u201cJoshua\u201d lose frequency in the United States in the 1990s (Lieberson 2000)?Why did the New England Patriots win the 2003 Super Bowl (Lieberson 1997)?Why did the political culture of corporations remain powerful among French workers in the 19th century (Sewell 1980)?Why did the heavy wheeled plough diffuse in the geographical pattern that it did in medieval France (Bloch 1966)?How did the socialist and republican parties of Spain mobilize the lower working class in support of their programs?How did the Solidarity Movement in Poland preserve its organization in face of state repression in the 1980s?Was the fact of skewed sex ratios in rural China a necessary condition for the occurrence of banditry and rebellion?  Was this fact a contributing condition?Why was there no broad-based militant movement of the poor in the United States during the Great Depression?Why do restaurants commonly add a gratuity of 18% for parties of 6 or more?We can learn a great deal about causal inquiry by reflecting briefly on a number of these examples.  There is a common thread among these examples, in that each topic directs inquiry towards the question, \u201cWhat are the causal conditions that give rise to a given social or historical outcome?\u201d  But there are a number of important differences among these examples as well.  Some are about a category of outcome (\u201ctwentieth-century revolution\u201d or \u201cethnic violence\u201d), whereas others are about a historically specific outcome (the Nicaraguan revolution, the Rwandan genocide, the 2003 Super Bowl).  Some are about large and publicly salient events, structures, and mentalities (states, revolutions, political cultures); others are about small-scale and unnoticed social characteristics (the frequency of first names).  And there are numerous other nuances that emerge from consideration of these examples.In each case it is a promising research strategy to attempt to discover the underlying social mechanisms that give rise to the outcome -- none of these examples suggests a purely statistical approach to the problem.  So inquiry into the \"microfoundations\" of the causal relations that are uncovered is needed.  And second, many of these examples suggest research approaches that make use of the methods of comparative historical sociology and case-study methodology.  The techniques of \"process-tracing\" and small-N comparison of cases should help to arrive at empirically supportable theories of the causal relations that underlie these groups of phenomena.ReferencesAdas, Michael. 1979.

Lee\u2019s book, Against the Law: Labor Protests in China's Rustbelt and Sunbelt, is a very important contribution to the sociology of contemporary China. The field needs this kind of innovative and theoretically adept work.  And one of the great strengths of the research is the fact that it takes the Chinese context seriously in a profound way; it is \u201cChina-centered\u201d sociology.  This stands in opposition to work that brings a theoretical perspective (often inspired by European experiences and theorists) and then attempts to \u201capply\u201d the theory to the data of Chinese experience.  C.K. does not make this mistake.  The book is a major empirical and theoretical contribution to the effort to better understand current social realities in China.  But it is also an important and innovative example of how to use sociological theories more generally to arrive at a sociology of urban 21st-century society and social change.The book looks at the rising incidence of labor protests in post-reform China.  Abrupt and profound social changes are occurring that have had a great impact on the condition of working people: privatization, dissolution of state safety net, new export factory system with labor supplied by rural immigrants.  C.K. looks at two regions and two \u201csituations\u201d:  Rustbelt (Liaoning in the northeast, where protests are stimulated by the loss of employment, unemployment benefits, medical care, unpaid pensions) and Sunbelt (Guangdong in the south, where protests are stimulated by discrimination, exploitation, and horrendous working conditions).  These are conditions that Anita Chan documents in China's Workers Under Assault: The Exploitation of Labor in a Globalizing Economy.  Towards the end of the book C.K. summarizes the two locales as representing \u201cThe death of socialism and the birth of capitalism\u201d or words to that effect. The title is important: \u201cAgainst the Law\u201d captures both the central theme of protest \u2013 workers appealing to agencies and the central state for their legal rights \u2013 but also to the insurgent and often repressed status of their protests.C.K. is interested in exploring the sociology of these labor worlds in an appropriately \u201clocal\u201d way: what are the specific features of the Chinese economy, Chinese production, Chinese policy and law, and Chinese culture that produce two rather different patterns of protest and contention in two segments of the Chinese manufacturing economy?Lee emphasizes the contingency of these developments and their dependency on rather proximate causal / social factors.  She believes that the nature of the mobilizations and protests is affected by the way in which they are framed.  Writing about Rustbelt protest: \u201cMy main concern \u2026 is to analyze how the characteristics and limits of worker protests are linked to the mode of state regulation of labor and the social reproduction of labor power\u201d (71).   Elsewhere she makes the point that Sunbelt protests have less mobilizational \u201cstaying power\u201d because of the living situation of migrant workers: they return to their villages in times of distress, and their movement collapses.  She distinguishes sub-types of Rustbelt protests by their underlying issue: nonpayment protests, neighborhood protests, bankruptcy protests.  In other words, rather specific circumstances that set the context for life and work in the two regions and sectors have substantial effects on the nature of dissent and protest that results.She also highlights the nuance and heterogeneity of the social realities she studies.  \u201cWhat strikes an outside observer as a homogeneous group confronting common economic predicaments growing out of structural reform is experienced from within the group as fragmented interests, unequal treatment, and mutual suspicion\u201d (84).  So she doesn\u2019t make the mistake of assuming homogeneity of \u201cworkers\u201d or other social categories.So a particular strength of her approach is that it emphasizes the contingency, variation, and internal heterogeneity in social processes that we should expect.  \u201cTheory\u201d is a help but not a blueprint.A substantive and important point that C.K. arrives at is the \u201ccellular\u201d nature of labor protest in China today. She refers almost all of these protests as \u201ccellular\u201d \u2013 meaning they lack a larger regional base of organization.  Also they are fairly spontaneous; not much local organization or planning is needed or provided. This cellularity derives from specific features of the social environments in which labor protests emerge in China today.  \u201cA confluence of institutional factors produce the prevailing pattern of cellular activism. State work units provide the physical sites of communication and coordination, organize workers\u2019 interests, and define the boundary of the aggrieved community\u201d (112).  But state surveillance and repression prevents the incubation of organizations \u2013 such as independent labor unions \u2013 that might convey local activism to a broader regional level.A second substantive point \u2013 perhaps her most fundamental point, and the inspiration for the title of the book \u2013 is the unusually central role that appeals to legal rights play in current examples of labor protest. Kevin O\u2019Brien refers to this strategy as \u201crightful resistance\u201d (Rightful Resistance in Rural China). C. K. makes the point clearly at the end of the book: \u201cThe centrality of the law and legalism is salient, and is perhaps a unique Chinese way of popular contention, triggered by the regime\u2019s decentralized legal authoritarianism. Even without formal or conscious cross-class alliance against the state, the common and ferocious charge of \u2018against the law\u2019 is a powerful and haunting chorus to the Chinese regime\u201d (261).A third important characteristic of C. K.\u2019s analysis is her insistence on the agency and subjectivity of the workers whose actions she considers.  She pays attention to their consciousness and ideas and their need for self-respect and dignity \u2013 these all play important roles in the movements and activism she describes. She insists on seeing workers as agents, not victims: \u201cLike the making of class, we cannot predict the outcome but can explain the trajectory of when and which ideological interpellation underlies what collective action\u201d (122).  And she emphasizes the \u201cmoral indignation\u201d aspect of many protests.  \u201cI seek to understand the indigenous meanings, relations, and institutional context that come packaged with these terms when they are invoked in the rustbelt, often simultaneously\u201d (114).  This means that it is a sociologically important area of research, to attempt to provide a deeper understanding of the consciousness of the men and women who make up this history.I am also appreciative of the methods of investigation and research that Lee uses.  She makes skillful use of her sophisticated understanding of various relevant pieces of sociological theory and analysis; her deep and expert knowledge of the chronology of legal reforms and policy shifts that have affected industry and labor in China since 1980; and an expert command of the macro-level economic and political data that are available about industrial change and labor unrest.  But these forms of theoretical and empirical knowledge constitute a foundation for a more qualitative kind of research: careful case studies of particular factories and disturbances based on her own fieldwork, along with interviews of participants that bring the book into the range of a kind of industrial ethnography.  In other words, the arguments of the book are situated within a strong theoretical and empirical understanding, and are moved forward through synthesis of many of her own observations and interviews with participants.  This combination gives the book a particularly acute flexibility when it comes to understanding the complexities of the social situations in Guangdong and Liaoning.  Her analysis of the two situations is not merely an expression of her underlying theories; rather, it is a sensitive \u201cportrait\u201d of the nuanced series of developments that are found in the two regions."}, {"title": "Kinds of knowledge claims in the social sciences", "date": "Tuesday, December 2, 2008", "text": "The philosophy of social science concerns itself with foundational questions about social science knowledge.  In line with this goal, it may be useful to consider a range of the types of knowledge claims that are advanced in various areas of the social sciences. This allows us to look a little more closely at the logic of social science assertions, which in turn leads to better epistemology (how do we support or test assertions like these), and better ontology (what sorts of things do these sentences refer to). Consider this cross-section of claims:Navajo language embodies a specific set of spatial concepts.Hindu culture places a high value on all forms of life. Major league baseball permits base stealing. MLB places a salary cap on every team. The nineteenth century British state incorporated a strong prime minister. Urban Latina women have a higher rate of X disease than the general population. Richard Nixon was lying when he said, \"I am not a crook.\"Winston Churchill advocated for the assault on the Dardanelles in 1915 in order to help resupply the Russian Army.Democracies do not wage war against democracies.South Indian villages embody a very high degree of social and gender inequality.Racial health disparities are caused by numerous factors, among which is the fact of the personal stress of living in a racially hostile environment.Public goods are generally under-provided in market societies. Socialist enterprises are generally inefficient because of a soft budget constraint. Official corruption is more frequent in legal-institutional settings with properties X, Y, Z. Properties U, V, W cause lower levels of official corruption in systems that embody them.  Working class identity in the United States is fractured. Deferred stock options are offered because they help solve principal-agent problems in high-tech firms. Major cities have mass transit systems to facilitate integrated labor markets. Fishing resources are generally over-utilized because of freerider behavior. There are a variety of grammatical forms and subjects involved in these examples.  We might consider whether it is possible to analyze these varied examples into a small number of propositional forms:Assertions of fact -- x has property P, y has relation R to z. Assertions of regularities and probabilistic properties of individuals within a population -- x's are usually P, the probability of E in circumstances C is p. Assertions of unobservable processes and mechanisms. Singular assertions of causation -- x caused y in circumstances C. General assertions of causation -- X's generally cause Y's in circumstances like C. Interpretive assertions -- the meaning of P's behavior is X. Intensional assertions -- P performed X in order to bring about Y. Ontological assertions -- X's consist of Y's. Compositional assertions -- X is part of Y. Functional assertions -- the function of X is F (within system S). This list can be further broken down into a small number of ontological categories: logical individuals, properties and relations, probability as frequency, causal relation, social identity, meaning and intention, social compound, function, system, structure. We might also need to specify the metaphysical concepts of change, time, space, continuity, uniformity, heterogeneity, and network. And we might want to specify a few epistemic concepts -- observable, hypothetical, testable, refutable, warranted.Are there any assertions in the social sciences that do not fit into one or another of these logical forms -- statements of fact, generalizations and estimates of conditional probabilities, causal hypotheses, theoretical statements, interpretations of meanings of actions and symbols?  It is difficult to come up with examples of assertions that cannot be reframed in these terms; certainly all the examples provided above can be paraphrased in terms of the logic of these varieties of assertion. So we might provisionally consider this list of types of assertions as being reasonably comprehensive.Does this analysis permit us to make use of a standard logical system of representation in terms of which to formulate all social science claims?  This question is analogous to the task faced by symbolic logic at the time of Frege (The Foundations of Arithmetic: A Logico-Mathematical Enquiry into the Concept of Number): is it possible to create a minimal symbolic syntax that permits the formulation of all truth claims within mathematics.  The first-order predicate calculus is the primary effort that logicians have offered as a solution to this problem.  And it is worth noticing that there are certain ideas that cannot be expressed within the resources of first-order logic -- the idea of necessity, for example. Modal logic introduces a new primitive operator representing the assertion that a sentence is necessarily true.  Likewise, counterfactual conditionals cannot be expressed within the resources of the first-order predicate calculus.  (Possible world semantics is an effort to address this lacuna.)  So we might consider, for the social sciences, what needs to be added to the resources of first-order logic to permit us to express all these kinds of assertions.  For example, do we need a special causal operator xCy, or is \"x causes y\" simply another kind of empirical relationship between x and y, analogous to \"x is longer than y\"?  Do we need an additional apparatus for representing conditional probability statements -- P(E|C) = r?  Do we need one or more propositional operators to represent intensional states: x believes that P, x intends that R, etc.?Formulating the concepts we use for analyzing social phenomena also raises major intellectual issues -- and we have to confront these conceptual problems in order to be able to formulate simple factual assertions. What do we mean by corruption? What is a democracy?  Further, it seems likely that many assertions can only be understood within a framework of other theoretical concepts and ideas, developed within the monograph or within the larger research community and literature. \"What is a 'Hindu community'?\" is a question that will be explicated differently in different research traditions -- ethnographic, linguistic, religious studies, comparative politics, women's studies.We can also ask what sort of logical order exists among concepts in the language of the social sciences -- is there a minimal set of concepts capable of expressing all possible ideas about the social world?  Essentially, this amounts to the question of whether it is possible to define all possible social concepts in terms of a set of primitive concepts and logical compounds of primitive concepts.  For example, suppose we are interested in analyzing the concept of a \"social identity\".  We have the choice of regarding \"social identity\" as a new primitive concept; or we can attempt to define this concept in terms of other concepts -- perhaps the individual-level concepts associated with individual belief and representation.Now return to the validation of assertions in the social sciences.  Consider a singular factual claim -- x has property P. What are the epistemological issues in evaluating such a claim? There are several, pertaining to the elements of the proposition. First, what is the nature of the individual x? Can we reidentify x across time and place? Does x have a suitable degree of stability over time? Does x have reasonably clear boundaries? Bill Gates, Chicago, NASA, and the Congress Party can all function as logical individuals; but the problems associated with definitions, boundaries, and identity through change are very different for each of them. (P. F. Strawson's book Individuals is a stimulating analysis of the metaphysics of individuals.)Second, how do we define the property P? Are there reasonably clear criteria of application to individuals, so it is credible to assert there is a fact of the matter as to whether y had P or not? Is P applicable on the basis of observable characteristics? Does P implicate additional hypotheses about causation or unobservable characteristics?  The concepts of a confessional religion, a market economy, narcissism, or a liberal democratic state all involve complex efforts at theory formation, involving the identification of a set of more basic characteristics and the formulation of a small theory about how these characteristics hang together in concrete historical instances.Finally, we can ask the ultimate question: what is the body of evidence and inference that allows us to conclude that x has property P? What are the vulnerabilities of this chain of inference? How credible is the attribution?"}, {"title": "Education and careers", "date": "Saturday, November 29, 2008", "text": "Secondary and post-secondary education plays a crucial role in the economic activity of any complex society. Kathleen Thelen provides a very fine description of the different talent regimes of Germany, Britain, Japan, and the United States in How Institutions Evolve: The Political Economy of Skills in Germany, Britain, the United States, and Japan. She highlights the very significant differences that exist across countries with respect to the internal and external structure of educational and training institutions and their relations to industry. Young people acquire the knowledge and skills they will need in order to play a productive role in the economy in these institutions -- which is to say that these institutions perform the function of preparing young people for jobs.  This implies, in turn, that schools ought to be well informed about the skill and talent needs of the economy within which they exist -- what basic and advanced skills young employees need to possess in order to fulfill expectations within the workplace and contribute value to the organizations they join.However, this expectation of linkage between schools and firms seems to be somewhat over-optimistic in the United States.  Educators and policy-makers appear to rely primarily on their own judgments about what a high school or college education ought to convey -- or what knowledge and skills a graduate ought to have achieved -- rather than gathering more systematic intelligence about what employers want and need in prospective workers. Sociologist James Rosenbaum argues in Beyond College For All: Career Paths For The Forgotten Half that this is an important weakness in the American system of secondary and post-secondary education -- in contrast to countries such as Germany or Japan, where such linkages are well established and effective.  Better linkages in both directions -- from employers in designing curriculum, and towards employers, in recommending graduates for employment -- would result in a substantially more effective system of education and work in the United States, according to Rosenbaum. In fact, some academic leaders take the view that \"career preparation\" is secondary to \"development of the mind\" as a priority in a college education.  The educational philosophy in selective universities (in arts and sciences, anyway) is premised on the cultivation of the intellectual breadth and maturity of the student and the nourishing of fundamental skills such as reasoning, communicating, quantitative ability, cultural sensibility, and moral awareness.  The underlying idea of this philosophy of liberal education is that these foundational skills, cultivated through a broad liberal education, will provide the intellectual resources necessary for the young person to succeed in a variety of careers and professions.  Martha Nussbaum expresses this philosophy very eloquently in Cultivating Humanity: A Classical Defense of Reform in Liberal Education.And, in fact, this is a good educational philosophy -- for a part of the total task of preparing all young people for work.  University graduates in history, sociology, biology, chemistry, philosophy, or literature can make immediate productive contributions in many organizations -- so the educational system that prepared them is plainly working well for this segment of the population and the job market.  This educational experience is best suited for preparing young people for additional study in graduate and professional programs, and for beginning jobs in professions where good analytical, reasoning, and communications skills are most important (e.g., consulting, banking, public relations, journalism, social justice organizations, non-governmental organizations, government agencies).  The work associated with these careers usually involves research, writing, problem-solving, collaboration, communication, and leadership; and graduates with the general intellectual and personal skills associated with a liberal arts education are usually well prepared in most or all of these areas.But it is perhaps a fallacy to imagine that this educational philosophy is suited to every individual.  There are important differences across individuals -- personality, curiosity, determination, ambition, and intellectual capacity -- that imply that individuals will differ in the degree to which this educational philosophy will further their talents.  Ideally, we would like to see an educational system that provides substantial realization of the talents and traits of each individual -- recognizing that there are substantial differences across individuals.  And it is likely that the \"liberal education\" philosophy is poorly suited to some individuals.  Second, it is equally fallacious to imagine that the educational philosophy of liberal education is the best foundation for every possible career -- from professor to physician to welder to fire warden to real estate agent.  And, in fact, this seems to be the central argument of Rosenbaum's book -- conveyed in his title, \"Beyond College for All.\"  This idea is unpacked in two related ways: first, that secondary schooling needs to improve substantially in order to achieve the outcomes it promises -- literacy, numeracy, and basic social skills of the workplace for all graduates.  Here the point appears to be that there are still a large number of jobs in the modern economy that require only the skills of a well-educated high school graduate. And he believes that American secondary schools ought to have substantially tighter linkages with industry and employers.  And second, the logic of Rosenbaum's argument leads to the idea that post-secondary education ought to be more differentiated, with opportunities for a wider range of personalities and talents.  Here the theory of the \"applied baccalaureate\" is perhaps a natural extension of Rosenbaum's argument (see this report from the Higher Learning Commission).  The applied baccalaureate is a four-year degree offered by a community college in a practitioner discipline (e.g., occupational therapy, nursing, computer-aided design, numerically controlled manufacturing).  And the background theory is that the program of study is designed in order to achieve the degree of specialization needed for immediate inclusion in a technically demanding job, with the degree of background scientific and technical knowledge that will permit the worker to grow in the job.This idea is likely to encounter criticism from thinkers such as Samuel Bowles and Herb Gintis (Schooling in Capitalist America: Educational Reform and the Contradictions of Economic Life), who argued quite a few years ago that the American system of education was stratified by class, with \"elite\" education going to young people destined for professional (high-paying) jobs, and vocational education going to young people destined for working-class jobs.  They argued, further, that the social psychology promoted by the two educational environments was itself class-specific: independence and creativity are encouraged in elite colleges, whereas docility and obedience are encouraged in vocational schools.  But I suppose that the best remedy to this critique is to aggressively pursue real equality of opportunity for all young people, so that individuals find their way to the various sectors of education according to their own talents and characters rather than the markers of class origin that they bear.  (Charles Sabel provides a different take on the relationship between class, education, and work in Work and Politics: The Division of Labour in Industry.  Among other things, Sabel challenges the \"elite/non-elite\" distinction when applied to different kinds of work.)"}, {"title": "Tempo of change", "date": "Friday, November 28, 2008", "text": "Think of some of the gradual processes of change that have important effects on human society: soil erosion, water pollution, loss of jobs, inflation, diffusion of innovation, a firm's decline in market share, and a nation's decline of naval power, to name a heterogeneous list. And think about the very different time scales associated with large processes of change, from days to months to years to decades and centuries. Think finally of the ability and readiness of human communities and leaders to recognize and address these processes of change through policy and change of behavior.We like to imagine that organizations and states have at least an imperfect ability to perceive threats to important interests and to design appropriate actions that may reduce threats or ameliorate consequences. (Likewise, of course, for opportunities.) \"Nimble\" organizations are able to perceive threats or opportunities and take corrective actions to avoid harms or achieve gains, while other organizations simply lumber on towards ever-deeper problems.  Does the scale over which a change unfolds make a difference in the ability of an organization to respond?  It does, at both ends of the spectrum.Changes that take place extremely slowly present special challenges for human societies. Examples include soil exhaustion, water pollution, and silting of waterways.  First, there is the problem of visibility -- it may be difficult for individuals to recognize the small differences that accrue over a period of several years. Individual policy makers and office holders may simply not see enough of the process of change during their time of service to allow them to perceive the change and its likely consequences.  Second is the problem of the perceived lack of urgency -- since the process is so slow, there may be an inclination to disregard it as unimportant. And third is the chronic problem of inter-generational planning -- the fact that longterm consequences will primarily only affect other people, not the current generation. Global climate change appears to fall in this category. The signs of harmful change were masked to some degree within the noise of random variation in climate and weather; the consequences are several generations in the future; and many states, including especially the United States, have found it difficult to come to grips with the scientific realities and design policies that ameliorate the negative consequences.  (An interesting example of long, slow processes and social response is that of water control, silting, and flooding in Imperial China. This situation is discussed in an earlier posting.)  So long, slow processes are difficult for a society, firm, or government to address effectively and prudently.But almost as disabling to effective policy reaction are changes that occur very rapidly.  Some processes of change move more quickly than the \"reaction time\" of the state or other policy-making bodies -- with the result that policy responses are designed for the situation at time T but are already out of date when time T+1 comes along.  (This may be the case with the current financial crisis.)  The familiar metaphor of \"guiding an aircraft carrier through a narrow twisting strait\" works pretty well here; the reaction time of the ship is longer than the interval between bends in the waterway, so it is all but impossible to steer the ship successfully.  The fiscal crisis of Louis XIV may fall in this category; financial and social institutions were unraveling in 1787-89 more rapidly than state officials and political advisers could successfully react.  So here again, the time scale of a process of change makes an important historical difference; very long and very short scales make it substantially more difficult for human and social agents to ameliorate harmful processes.There is one other complication created by the tempo and scale of historical processes: the possibility of a damaging \"harmonious vibration\" of social processes.  If there is a business cycle of eight years and a grain production cycle of five years, then every forty years the troughs of the two cycles will coincide -- with more harmful consequences than created by either cycle separately.  (It was this kind of unanticipated harmonious vibration that brought down the Tacoma Narrows Bridge in 1940.)  In this case it is the intersection of two tempos of change that creates the possibility of more severe social crisis and important historical consequences.Paul Pierson's Politics in Time: History, Institutions, and Social Analysis raises some of the challenging research questions that are raised by the time scale of an historical process.  He provides a very useful taxonomy of events in terms of \"time horizon of cause\" and \"time horizon of outcome\".  This creates four categories of events around \"long\" and \"short\"; illustrations of each category include tornado (short-short), earthquake (long-short), meteorite (short-long), and global warming (long-long).  And he points out that much research in the social sciences focuses on examples from the \"short-short\" category -- events with discrete causes and time-limited effects.  The issue of time scale is also invoked in the history of the longue dur\u00e9e, including particularly writings by Fernand Braudel and Emmanuel Le Roy Ladurie, where the historians of the Annales school paid particular attention to the long, slow changes in structures that influenced European history.The mix of race, poverty, and urban space has created intractable social issues in many American cities in the past sixty years.  Residential segregation creates a terrible fabric of self-reproducing inequalities between the segregated group and the larger society -- inequalities of education, health, employment, and culture.   As intractable as this social system of segregation appears to be in the cities of the United States, it may be that the situation in France is even worse.  Sociologist Didier Lapeyronnie is interviewed in a recent issue of the Nouvel Obs on the key findings of his recent book, Ghetto urbain: Segregation, violence, pauvrete en France aujourd'hui.   The interview makes for absorbing reading.Lapeyronnie is an expert on urban sociology, poverty, and immigration in France and a frequent observer of the rising urban crisis in France.  (I'm deliberately evoking here the title of Tom Sugrue's book, The Origins of the Urban Crisis: Race and Inequality in Postwar Detroit.) Lapeyronnie's view is grim: the isolation and despair characteristic of French ghetto and banlieue communities are worsening year after year, and the French state's promises after the disturbances of 2005 have not been fulfilled.  Unemployment, limited educational opportunities, and poverty create an environment in which young people have neither the resources nor the opportunities to improve their social position, and they are largely excluded from the larger French society.Lapeyronnie offers several important observations. These ghettos are largely populated by immigrant communities -- first, second, or third-generation immigrants from North Africa and former French colonies.  Racism is a crucial element in the development and evolution of these segregated spaces.  As he puts it:The ghetto is the product of two mechanisms: social and racial segregation and poverty, which enclose people in their neighborhoods, leading to the formation of a veritable counter-society with its own norms, its economy (what one calls the black economy), and even its own political system. ... Poor and segregated, feeling ostracized by the Republic and plunged into a veritable political vacuum, they have organized a counter-society which protects them even as they are disadvantaged in relation to the exterior world.Lapeyronnie makes the point that the development of segregated ghettos is more advanced and more harmful in the smaller cities of France.  He describes the situation in these smaller cities as creating an almost total barrier between the ghetto and the surrounding city -- an environment where the possibility of economic or social interaction has all but disappeared.Lapeyronnie notes the role that gender plays in the segregation system.  Women of the ghetto can move back and forth -- if they accept the \"dominant norms\" of dress and behavior.  And this means the head scarf, in particular.  In order to pass across the boundary of ghetto and city, women must adopt the dress of non-Muslim French society.  But, as Lapeyronnie points out, this creates a deeply ambiguous position for women, because modest dress and head scarf are all but mandatory within the space of the ghetto.   \"The veil is interpreted as a sexual symbol, affirmation of a sexual solidarity with Muslim men.  It often engenders hostility outside the ghetto while providing protection within the ghetto.\"  \"Here one finds one of the central explanations of the formation of the ghetto ... which is organized around the articulation of the race of the men and the sex of the women.\"Another interesting sociological observation concerns the nature of the social networks within and without the ghetto.  Lapeyronnie distinguishes between \"strong network ties\" (liens forts) and weak network ties (liens faibles), and he asserts that social relationships in the ghetto fall in the first category: everyone knows everyone.  As a network diagram, this would result in a dense network in which every node is connected to every other node.  But Lapeyronnie makes the point that weak networks are a source of strength and innovation in the larger society that is lacking in the ghetto; people can \"network\" to strangers through a series of connections.  So opportunities are widely available -- finding a job by passing one's CV through a series of people, for example.  \"Strong networks protect people, they are like a cocoon ... But they are also a handicap and a weight on each person.  Not only is the individual deprived of resources, but many people don't know a single person outside the neighborhood.\"  Moreover, this strong network characteristic is very effective at enforcing a group morality (along the lines of Durkheim): \"There is a morality and set of norms in the strong network: don't betray, be faithful to one's friends, stay together.\"Lapeyronnie concludes the interview with these words:When a population is placed in a situation of poverty and lives within racial segregation, it returns to very traditional definitions of social roles, notably the roles of family, and on a rigid and often bigoted morality.  This is what permits building the strong network.This is a pretty powerful analysis of the social transformations that are created by segregation, racism, isolation, and poverty -- and it doesn't bode well for social peace in France.  Lapeyronnie is describing the development of an extensive \"counter-society\" that may be more and more important in coming years.  The social networks and social relationships that Lapeyronnie describes are a potent basis for social mobilization and new social movements, and there don't seem to be many pathways towards social progress to which such movements might be directed."}, {"title": "Narrative history", "date": "Monday, November 24, 2008", "text": "People sometimes imagine that history is narrative, full stop. This is not the case; there certainly are important forms of historical writing that do not take the form of narrative. But let's consider some of the logical features of narrative, since there is no disputing that this is one important variety of historical knowledge.What is a narrative? Most generally, it is an account of how and why a situation or event came to be. A narrative is intended to provide an account of how a complex historical event unfolded and why. We want to understand the event in time.  What were the contextual features that were relevant to the outcome -- the settings at one or more points in time that played a role? What were the actions and choices that agents performed, and why did they take these actions rather than other possible choices? What causal processes -- either social or natural -- may have played a role in bringing the world to the outcome of interest? (For example, the Little Ice Age pushed Europe's population into different patterns of cultivation and fishing, with major consequences for subsequent developments; Brian Fagan, The Little Ice Age: How Climate Made History, 1300-1850.)So a narrative seeks to provide hermeneutic understanding of the outcome -- why did actors behave as they did in bringing about the outcome? -- and causal explanation -- what social and natural processes were acting behind the backs of the actors in bringing about the outcome? And different narratives represent different mixes of hermeneutic and causal factors. Bob Woodward's narrative of the Bush administration's decision to go to war against Saddam Hussein is primarily actor-centered and interpretive -- who said what, who influenced the decisions, the reasons and motives that ultimately prevailed with the president and top national security officials (Plan of Attack). Juan Cole's treatment of the same historical moment, on the other hand, gives more emphasis to hidden motives -- what the \"real\" objectives were (see his blog, InformedComment). But both authors aim to clarify the reasoning, motives, and dynamics among decision-makers that led to the outcome.  Narratives about the decision to go to war against Hussein's Iraq have an important feature on common: they single out a fairly brief historical moment and focus on the proximate actions and causes that created the outcome. This is an instance of \"micro-history\" -- an effort to explain and understand an important but bounded event.  Is it possible to construct narratives of more extended historical processes?Certainly it is. Consider histories of World War II, the Holy Roman Empire, or the Qing Dynasty. These are each large complexes including thousands of events and conditions over an extended period of time.  Histories of these topics often take the form of chronologically organized presentations of occurrences and conditions, with a narrative storyline that attempts to hold these events together in a single story. There may also be an effort to break down the history topically or regionally -- \"War in the Pacific; North Africa; Western Europe\" or \"Technology; Intelligence; Supply and Industry; Command; Genocide\". But for the history to take the form of a narrative, there needs to be an organized effort to weave the account into a somewhat coherent story; a series of intertwined events and conditions leading eventually to an outcome.A crucial and unavoidable feature of narrative history is the fact of selectivity. The narrative historian is forced to make choices and selections at every stage: between \"significant\" and \"insignificant\", between \"sideshow\" and \"main event\", and between levels of description. (Is World War II better described at the level of generals and policy-makers or infantrymen and factory workers?)Another crucial feature of the genre of narrative history is the tension between structure and agency. Historians differ about where to set the balance between constraining structures and choosing agents. Partially this is a difference of opinion about the relative weight of various kinds of historical factors; but it is also a disagreement about what is interesting -- choices or background conditions.What are the criteria of success for a historical narrative? To start, there is the issue of the factual claims included in the account. A narrative of Abraham Lincoln's presidency that gets the names of the members of his cabinet wrong will not do well in the New York Times Book Review. Second, there is the overall persuasiveness and foundation in evidence of the interpretations of actions that are offered. Third, the causal claims that the account advances will be tested for their empirical and logical foundations. If the claim is made that some aspect of Andrew Jackson's presidency was influenced by the fragility of current banking institutions, we will want to assess whether this financial feature could be judged to have this result in the circumstances.These are criteria that relate directly to the epistemic status of the many claims that the narrative advances. In addition, it is plausible that we evaluate narratives according to non-evidentiary criteria: the coherence of the story that is told, the degree of fit between \"our\" interest in the historical moment and the content of the narrative, and the degree of \"lean\" comprehensiveness the author provides. Does the author provide enough of the right sorts of details to make the story comprehensible, without overwhelming the reader with a thicket of extraneous facts?Some of these criteria are clearly epistemic, having to do with evidence and credibility. But others are more aesthetic and interest-based, having to do with how well the account fits our expectations and interests. And this fact seems to set a bound on the degree to which one account is objectively superior to another."}, {"title": "G. William Skinner", "date": "Monday, November 17, 2008", "text": "G. William Skinner was one of the most innovative social scientists to have turned his attention to China in the past thirty years. Bill passed away on October 25, 2008, but his influence on how we think about China will survive him for a long, long time. (See this\u00a0list\u00a0of Skinner's publications to get an impression of the depth and scope of his contributions.) Bill was a generous and open scholar, and many scholars working in the field today owe him a permanent debt of gratitude for his advice and support in the past several decades. (See this Chinese\u00a0obituary\u00a0documenting Skinner's significance for Chinese scholars.)Bill was a particularly fertile thinker when it came to using analytical and spatial models to explicate social reality in China (and occasionally Japan or France). (His work on Japanese demographic behavior is a great example; he devised an analytical framework for permitting inferences about family planning choices within Japanese peasant families demonstrating very specific preferences about birth order depending on the age and wealth of the parents. See \"Conjugal Power in Tokugawa Japanese Families\" in\u00a0Sex and Gender Hierarchies, edited by B. D. Miller (Cambridge University Press, 1989).) Skinner was insistent that social data need to be analyzed in spatial terms; he believed that many social patterns will be best understood when they are placed in their geographical context. And the reason for this is straightforward: human social activity itself is structured in space, through transport systems, habitation patterns, the circuits of merchants and necromancers, and the waterways that integrate social and economic systems in pre-modern societies. He also believed that identifying the right level of geographical aggregation is an important and substantive task; for example, he argued against the idea of making economic comparisons across provinces in China, on the basis that provincial boundaries emerged as a result of a series of administrative accidents rather than defining \"natural\" boundaries of human activity.Several ideas that Skinner developed in detail have had particular impact. His analysis of the marketing systems of Sichuan using the conceptual tools of central place theory was very influential when it appeared in three parts in theJournal of Asian Studies\u00a0(1964-65) (part I,\u00a0part II,\u00a0part III). This analysis was illustrative in several key ways. It gave an important empirical instance for the abstract geometry of cental place theory -- the nested hexagons that represent the optimal spatial distribution of towns, villages, and cities. But more important, the analysis creates an important shift of focus from the village to the larger social systems of interchange within which villages are located -- the patterns of social intercourse that are associated with periodic markets, the flow of ideas associated with the circuits of martial arts specialists, and the likelihood of intersections between economic, cultural, and political processes rooted in the geometry of social exchange.SOURCE: Skinner, G. William. 1964-65. Marketing and Social Structure in Rural China.\u00a0Journal of Asian Studies\u00a024 (1-3), pp. 22-23A second highly influential idea also falls within the intellectual precincts of economic geography. Skinner offered an analysis of the economic geography of late imperial China in terms of a set of eight (or nine)\u00a0macroregions: physiographically bounded regions consisting of core and periphery, regarding which the bulk of trade occurs internally rather than externally. Skinner argues in this body of research that it is analytically faulty to treat China as a single national market system in this period of time; rather, economic activity was largely confined within the separate macroregions. He used empirical measures to establish the distinctions between core and periphery, as well as to draw boundaries between adjacent macroregions. As he points out, the economic geography of traditional Chinese economy was largely governed by transport cost, and this meant that China's river systems largely defined the shape and scope of intra- and inter-regional markets. And he demonstrated how human activity was structured by the patterns of social interaction defined by these macroregions -- for example, the transfer of soil fertility from periphery to core through the gathering of fuel wood in the periphery, which then is transferred to core soils after burning.SOURCE: Skinner, G. William. 1977. Regional Urbanization in Nineteenth-Century China. In\u00a0The City in Late Imperial China, edited by G. W. Skinner. Stanford: Stanford University Press, p. 215.Another critical contribution that Skinner provided, through his own contribution to the highly important\u00a0City in Late Imperial China\u00a0volume (link), is the idea of a hierarchy of urban systems. Skinner argued that there was an orderly hierarchy of places, ranging from higher-level cities through lower-level cities, market towns, and villages. He distinguishes between two types of hierarchy: administrative-bureaucratic hierarchy of places and the economic-commercial hierarchy of places. These two systems create different characteristics and functions for the cities that fall within them. This body of formal analytical ideas is borrowed from urban geographers such as Walter Crystaller and Johann Heinrich von Th\u00fcnen. Skinner's genius was to recognize that these analytical approaches provided a lens through which to make sense of Chinese social activity across space and time that other approaches do not. In particular, Bill demonstrated the utility of a spatial and regional approach in contrast to both purely statistical analyses of China's economy and village-level ethnographic studies that ignored the urban and town relationships within which village society was situated.SOURCE: Skinner, G. William, ed. 1977.\u00a0The City in Late Imperial China, Studies in Chinese society. Stanford, Calif.: Stanford University Press, p. 289SOURCE: Skinner, G. William, ed. 1977.\u00a0The City in Late Imperial China, Studies in Chinese society. Stanford, Calif.: Stanford University Press, p. 294A central and crucial aspect of Skinner's thinking is spatial; he was vastly ahead of the GIS revolution in the social sciences, in that he consistently tried to analyze China's social, economic, and cultural data in terms of the spatial patterns that it displayed decades before the corresponding desktop computation capability was available. I visited his research laboratory at UC-Davis sometime early in the 1990s, and was struck by a couple of vignettes. When I arrived he was poring over a Chinese census atlas in eight gradations with a magnifying glass; he was laboriously coding counties by the color representing a range of social estimates. And when he brought me to examine a wall-sized map he had produced mapping sex ratios across part of southeastern China, he was interested in pointing out how the values of sex ratios corresponded to the core-periphery framework mentioned above. I pointed out a small, bounded region in southwest China that appeared to be anomalous, in that it represented an island of normal sex ratios in a sea of high male-female ratios. He instantly replied: that's an ethnic minority population that doesn't discriminate against girls. Culture and space!Another of Skinner's crucial contributions to the China field -- and to historical social science more generally -- was his devotion to the project of creating a public database of historical Chinese social, economic, and cultural data at the county level. This effort contributed to the eventual formation of the China Historical Geographical Information System (CHGIS). What is striking about this work is that it was begun at a period in which the desktop computing tools that would permit easy and flexible use of the data -- in producing historical statistical maps, for example -- did not yet exist.G. William Skinner provided a genuinely unique contribution to our understanding of the social realities of China. His contributions were innovative in the deepest sense possible: he brought an appropriate set of tools to each topic of investigation he addressed, without presuming that existing analytical techniques would do the job.Why does social unrest occur and spread?This is a little bit of a trick question. It really implies three questions: What are the circumstances that make unrest in a population possible or likely? What circumstances need to occur in order to precipitate expressions of unrest in particular places? And what circumstances are conducive to spreading (or damping out) these local expressions?First, how might we define the concept of \"unrest\"? To my ear the concept involves grievance and activism. Grievance involves the situation where individuals and groups feel that they have been badly treated by someone. Activism implies a disposition to act visibly and politically to protest or alleviate this mistreatment. Grievance can exist without activism, and there are instances of activism that stem from emotions other than grievance. But when these emotional and behavioral states come together we can refer to the resulting stew of behavior as \"unrest\".So let's start with the causes of grievance. Power relations create the emotions of grievance: excessive conscription or taxation, insufficient attention to the interests of an ethnic minority, abusive and disrespectful treatment by the police. When individuals and groups believe they are being treated in ways that unfairly harm their interests or reduce their dignity, they are likely to feel aggrieved.Grievance is a propositional emotion; it involves a subject, a harm, and a perpetrator. And this means that grievance is not simply a reaponse to suffering. Take a population that is experiencing dearth in the early stages of famine. Individuals and sub-groups may differ in their experience of grievance; they may hold different social actors responsible for their suffering (landlords, lenders, city people, the military, or the state, for example). And these differences have implications for how and when these groups may be aroused to protest and action.What about \"activism\"? What kind of psycho-political state is this? It is a propensity to make the transition from political emotion to action -- to go from resentment of the state's behavior to the choice of joining a street demonstration; to go from anger about conscription to joining an anti-draft organization; to go from frustration about the landlord's unwillingness to restore the heat to joining with others in a rent strike. \"Activism\" appears to be a complex characteristic of individuals and groups. For one thing, it seems to have a substantial component of culture and tradition baked into it. Cultures seem to differ in their responses to mistreatment; some communities seem to have resources for activist mobilization that others lack. Second, there appears to be a substantial degree of social learning through imitation involved in becoming \"activist.\" So it is likely that there is a degree of positive feedback involved in the spread of activist psychology.So back to the original question: what causes the spread of unrest? There needs to be an issue that creates a grievance in a significant number of people. Something needs to happen to make this issue salient relative to other concerns. There needs to be a critical mass of people who share the grievance and possess the components of the social emotions of activism. And there needs to be a \"spark\" that allows activists to mobilize others.Consider a hypothetical example -- a company with dozens of factories in different parts of the country that is imposing a unilateral change in its contributions to worker retirement accounts. Suppose each factory has several thousand workers; and suppose that there is a range of responses to the retirement changes in the various factories along these lines:Quiescence and grudging acceptanceWidespread grousing but no organized actionWildcat strikes What factors might account for these different responses to essentially the same event?Several possible explanations might be considered:The presence/absence of effective rank-and-file leadersThe presence/absence of effective local managers' countermeasures (persuasion, cooptation, threats)Strong/weak traditions of activism in different locationsAlternative narratives about what the changes mean (\"inevitable in this business climate\", \"better this than a lot of layoffs\", \"higher management is taking this opportunity to stiff us\", ....)High/low impact of the management changes on the interests of workers in each locationStrong/weak channels of communication among workers in different factoriesIt is, of course, a matter for empirical investigation to determine whether some or all of these factors played a causal role. But we can give good theoretical reasons for thinking that these are socially possible mechanisms that may underlie the observed differences in behavior.We might speculate, then, that unrest is most likely to occur and spread when there is an abuse that affects a large number of people; there is a generally shared understanding of the nature of the abuse; there are effective local activists capable of arousing the indignation of the rank-and-file; there are accessible communication vehicles permitting the spreading of messages of dissent; the population has a tradition of activism; and the state's managers are ineffectual in damping down the occurrences of protest. These conditions appear most favorable for the dissemination of unrest."}, {"title": "How do new ideas get used?", "date": "Wednesday, November 12, 2008", "text": "Economic development and growth depend chiefly on innovation -- new products, processes, materials, and modes of organization that can create new opportunities in the marketplace. Business creation and economic growth depend upon innovation.  This means creating new products that consumers want or need, improving the performance or safety of the product, or improving the cost and efficiency of the process of production and distribution.  So a critical element in economic development is the discovery and development of new ideas -- often technical and scientific ideas.  Google, Apple, and Pfizer are examples of industries that created brand new markets for products based on innovations in science and engineering (search technologies, user-friendly computing devices, cholesterol regulating drugs).Universities are places where highly specialized and talented people are in the business of making discoveries and further developing or refining existing ideas.  So we might expect that universities would also be potent sources of economic growth.  New ideas surface in engineering, science, or medical research facilities; they are quickly recognized for their potential applications in the marketplace; and entrepreneurs or existing businesses capitalize on them and move them quickly to the marketplace.  The basis for this expectation is a familiar one within an Adam Smith sort of framework: new ideas are a potential source of new wealth, and rational maximizers will quickly identify these new wealth opportunities and will quickly and efficiently develop them.We might expect that this is the case.  But surprisingly enough, this picture seems not to be born out in experience.  What seems much more true as a description of the process of research and discovery, is that most ideas do not move into the process of commercialization and business development.  In fact, it seems like a fairly believable guess that there exist today in the stock of university research discoveries, the makings of dozens of billion-dollar industries and hundreds or thousands of million-dollar industries -- and that these ideas are likely enough to remain dormant for a very long time.  Most ideas are not fully developed as business ventures, not because they are not viable, but because the activity of recognizing the market potential of an idea and developing it commercially is itself an extended effort that requires imagination and creativity, and this is not usually either the strength or the priority of the working research scientist.So what is the obstacle to the full and efficient development of potentially profitable new innovations?  Part of the problem is the separation that exists between the research community and the business community.  The person who understands the new technology or scientific innovation does not usually understand the commercial potential of the idea, and usually does not have much of a practical idea of what is involved in commercializing an innovation.  The research scientist in a university is largely motivated by the rewards of academic progress: publication, the gaining of grants to support future research, and the rewards of prestige that go with academic success.  The gap between the technical characteristics of the innovation and the steps that would need to be taken in order to transform this innovation into a business venture is also a very wide one.  A research scientist may have developed a technique for coating metals that permits the metal to preserve an electrical charge.  But it is not self-evident how this innovation might be developed into new products or processes that have the potential for creating substantial new markets or profits.  The researcher who conducts the basic research leading to the innovation usually has little knowledge or interest in the applications that might be possible. And the challenge of bridging the gap between the innovation and some of its potential commercial applications may demand an equally creative and time-consuming period of intellectual and practical work as did the original discovery -- and this is likely to be a form of effort that is foreign to the research scientist.It might be thought that innovation-oriented investors are among the important mechanisms that help to identify potentially valuable ideas and innovations and move them to successful businesses.  \"Angel\" investors and venture capital firms are certainly filling part of the role of \"innovation spotters\" in the modern economy.  But even this mechanism seems incomplete, in the sense that potentially valuable engineering and scientific research activity generally remains invisible to the investor community until an entrepreneurial researcher brings it forward along with a business plan.  So there is a wide information gap between the researcher, the investor, and the business entrepreneur.These observations suggest two things.  First, our economy could be strengthened if we had a substantially more efficient system of identifying innovations as they occur in laboratories throughout the country, and moving these innovations into productive applications.  And second, the story seems to suggest that there is a niche available in our economy that would provide profitable opportunities for businesses that are specifically designed to seek out these innovations and innovators and facilitate the transition from idea to product.Thomas Hughes' detailed history of electric power is a very important illustration of several aspects of this complex story (Networks of Power: Electrification in Western Society, 1880-1930).  Hughes demonstrates how long the chain of development is between basic science and useable technology; he also highlights the many contingencies that occur along the way, as electric power generation technology is developed into a mass industry using alternating current.  One of the most frequently discussed examples of technology innovation and business development is the story of how the innovations in computer interfaces (the mouse, WYSIWYG editing, Windows-style interface) that were created by Xerox PARC found their way into the multi-billion dollar industry of personal computing.  Douglas Smith and Robert Alexander emphasize the business mistakes that many people attribute to Xerox in this story in Fumbling the Future: How Xerox Invented, Then Ignored, the First Personal Computer, while Michael Hiltzik's Dealers of Lightning: Xerox PARC and the Dawn of the Computer Age provides a more favorable version of the story."}, {"title": "Causing public opinion", "date": "Friday, November 7, 2008", "text": "It is interesting to consider what sorts of things cause shifts in public opinion about specific issues. This week's national election is one important example. But what about more focused issues -- for example, the many ballot initiatives that were considered in many states?  To what extent can we discover whether there is a measurable effect on public opinion by the organized efforts of advocacy groups through advertising and other strategies for reaching the minds of voters?In these cases we might imagine that voters have a prior set of attitudes towards the issue -- perhaps including a large number of \"don't know/don't care\" people. Then a set of advocates form to lobby the public pro and con. They mount campaigns to influence voters' opinions towards the option they prefer. And on the day of the election voters will indicate their approval -- often in ratios quite different from those that were measured in pre-campaign surveys. So something happened to change the composition of public opinion on the issue. The question here is whether it is possible to estimate the effects of various possible influencers.This seems like potentially a very simple area of causal reasoning about social processes. The outcome variable is fairly observable through polling and the final election, and the interventions are also usually observable as well, both in timing and magnitude. So the world may present us with a series of interventions and outcomes that support fairly strong causal conclusions -- for example, \"each time ad campaign X hits the airwaves in a given market, there is an observed uptick in support for the proposition.\" It is unlikely that the correlation occurred as a result of random variations in both terms; we have a theory of how advertising influences voters; and we conclude that \"ad campaign X was a causal factor in shaping voter opinion in this time period.\" (It is even possible that X played a role in both segments of opinion, resulting in an up-tick in both yes and no responses. Then we might also judge that X was effective at polarizing voters -- not the effect the strategist would have aimed at.)This is an example of singular causal reasoning, in that it has to do with one population, one issue, and a specific series of interventions. What would be needed in order to arrive at a conclusion with generic scope -- for example, \"advertising along the lines of X is generally effective in increasing support for its issue\"?  The most straightforward argument to the generic conclusion would be a study of an extended set of cases with a variety of strategies in play. If we discover something like this -- \"In 80% of cases where X is included in the mix it is observed to have a positive effect on opinion\" -- then we would have inductive reason for accepting the generic causal claim as well. This is basic experimental reasoning.Take a hypothetical issue -- a referendum on a proposal for changing the system the state uses for assessing business taxes. Suppose that a polling firm has done weekly polling on the question and has recorded \"yes/no/no opinion\" since October 2007. Suppose that two organizations emerged in December to advocate for and against the proposal; that each raised about $5 million; and that each included an advertising campaign in its strategy. Suppose further that the \"no\" campaign also included a well-organized effort at the parish level to persuade church members to vote against the measure on religious grounds and the \"yes\" campaign included a grassroots effort to get university students and staff to be supportive of the measure on pro-science and pro-economy grounds. And suppose each organization mounted a \"new media\" campaign using email lists and web comminication to make its case.  Finally, suppose we have good timeline data about the occurrence and volume of media spots throughout the period of June through November.This scenario involves three types of causes, a timeline representing the application of the interventions, and a timeline representing the effects. From this body of data can we arrive at estimates of the relative efficacy of the three treatments? And does this set if conclusions provide credible guidance for other campaigns over other issues in other places?There is also the question of the efficacy of the implementation of the strategies. Take the ad campaigns. Whether a specific campaign succeeds in changing viewers' opinions depends on the content, message, and production quality. Does the message resonate with a target segment of voters? Does the production design stimulate emotions that will lead to the desired vote? So evaluating efficacy needs to be done across instances of media as well as across varieties of media. (This is the function of focus groups and snap polls -- to evaluate the effects of specific messages and production choices on real voters.)(Here is a link to some information about the process leading up to a positive vote on the Michigan Stem Cell initiative this month.  A good general introduction to the social psychological theories about the formation of attitudes and opinions is Stuart Oskamp and P. Wesley Schultz, Attitudes and Opinions.)"}, {"title": "Are there \"social kinds\"?", "date": "Sunday, November 2, 2008", "text": "Philosophers of science sometimes define the idea of a natural kind as \"a group of things that share a fundamental set of causal properties.\"  Examples might be \"gold,\" \"metal,\" and \"protein molecule.\" And some philosophers assume that scientific realism means being realist about natural kinds.  Do the typical concepts used in the social sciences succeed in identifying a social analog to natural kinds, which might be referred to as \"social kinds\"?   And if not, is it possible to be realist about the social world but anti-realist with respect to \"social kinds\"?First, what is involved in being \u201crealist\u201d in connection with the historical and human sciences?  It is to assert several independent things: first, that there is the possibility of (fallibly) objective knowledge of social facts; second, that there are \u201csocial facts\u201d to be known \u2013 that is, there are some mind- or interpretation-independent things that happen and can be the subject of knowledge; and third (questionably), that there are categories of higher-level social entities that \u201creally\u201d exist in the way that some philosophers say that natural kinds exist.  It is entirely defensible to be a scientific realist in the social sciences, and I want to support the first two ideas but to argue against the third.Concepts are of course essential to social knowledge.  The heart of social inquiry has to do with coming up with concepts that allow us to better understand social reality: for example, racism, patterns of behavior, free market, class consciousness, ethnic identities.  Theory formation in the social sciences largely consists of the task of constructing concepts and categories that capture groups of social phenomena for the purpose of analysis.  But even the most successful social concepts do not identify groups of phenomena that could be called a \"social kind.\"  High-level social concepts that serve to pick out groups of social phenomena\u2014states, riots, property systems\u2014generally do not refer to causally homogeneous bodies of social phenomena; instead, each of these is composed of individual social formations with their own history and circumstances.  There is no uniform causal constitution that underlies all states or riots.  The philosophical notions of \u201cfamily resemblance\u201d and \u201ccluster concepts\u201d serve better to characterize these high-level social concepts than does \u201cnatural kind\u201d. Examples of what might have been thought to be social kinds might include concepts such as these: proletariat, underclass resentment, revolutionary situation, racism; liberal representative states; fascism; feudalism; bureaucratic state.  But I hold that these are not kinds in the strong sense that philosophers of the natural sciences have in mind.  Rather, they are plastic, variable, opportunistic, individually specific instantiations across a variety of human contexts.  We need to be able to identify some topics of interest, so we need language and concepts; but we must avoid reifying the concepts and thinking they refer to some underlying discoverable essence.  (Think of how Chuck Tilly conceptualizes riot, rebellion, and resistance in terms of \u201ccontentious politics.\u201d  Rightly, he avoids the idea that there is one common thing going on in these instances across time, history, and place; his goal is to identify a medium-sized body of causal mechanisms that bundle together in various contexts to give rise to one signature of contention or another.)The discovery of causal processes is essential to social explanation -- not the discovery of high-level uniform categories of social events or structures.  We explain social outcomes best when we can uncover the causal mechanisms that gave rise to them.  However, most social ensembles are the result of multiple causal mechanisms, and their natures are not common, simple, or invariant.  \u201cStates\u201d embody mechanisms of social control.  But as Tolstoy said about unhappy families, every state manages its contention in somewhat different ways.  So we can\u2019t and shouldn\u2019t expect common causal properties across the class of \u201cstates\u201d.  And this is directly relevant to the central point here: the \"state\" is not a social kind, and there is no simple theory that encapsulates its causal properties.This approach has specific implications for the conduct of the social sciences.  For example, political science and the study of different types of states: we can identify common mechanisms, sub-institutions, building blocks, etc., that recur in different political systems.  And we can offer causal explanations of specific states in particular historical circumstances -- for example, the Brazilian state in the 1990s.  But we cannot produce strong generalizations about \u201cstates\u201d or even particular kinds of states -- for example, \u201cdeveloping states\u201d.  Or at least, the generalizations we find are weak and exception-laden.  Rather, we must build up our explanations from the component mechanisms and institutions found in the particular cases. So here is a moderate form of scientific realism that is well suited to the nature of the social world: be realist about social mechanisms but not about social kinds.  Be realist and empiricist in epistemology: we can arrive at rationally justified beliefs about social mechanisms.  And be a skeptic or nominalist about social kinds.  There are no macro or molar-level social kinds.Quite a few of the posts in the blog are grounded in a theory of social ontology that I refer to as methodological localism.  This theory of social entities affirms that there are large social structures and facts that influence social outcomes.  But it insists that these structures are only possible insofar as they are embodied in the actions and states of socially constructed individuals.  The \u201cmolecule\u201d of all social life is the socially constructed and socially situated individual, who lives, acts, and develops within a set of local social relationships, institutions, norms, and rules.With methodological individualism, this position embraces the point that individuals are the bearers of social structures and causes.  There is no such thing as an autonomous social force; rather, all social properties and effects are conveyed through the individuals who constitute a population at a time.  Against individualism, however, methodological localism affirms the \u201csocial-ness\u201d of social actors.  Methodological localism denies the possibility or desirability of characterizing the individual extra-socially.  Instead, the individual is understood as a socially constituted actor, affected by large current social facts such as value systems, social structures, extended social networks, and the like.  In other words, ML denies the possibility of reductionism from the level of the social to the level of a population of non-social individuals.  Rather, the individual is formed by locally embodied social facts, and the social facts are in turn constituted by the current characteristics of the persons who make them up.This account begins with the socially constituted person. Human beings are subjective, intentional, and relational agents. They interact with other persons in ways that involve competition and cooperation. They form relationships, enmities, alliances, and networks; they compose institutions and organizations. They create material embodiments that reflect and affect human intentionality. They acquire beliefs, norms, practices, and worldviews, and they socialize their children, their friends, and others with whom they interact. Some of the products of human social interaction are short-lived and local (indigenous fishing practices); others are long-duration but local (oral traditions, stories, and jokes); and yet others are built up into social organizations of great geographical scope and extended duration (states, trade routes, knowledge systems). But always we have individual agents interacting with other agents, making use of resources (material and social), and pursuing their goals, desires, and impulses.Social action takes place within spaces that are themselves socially structured by the actions and purposes of others\u2014by property, by prejudice, by law and custom, and by systems of knowledge. So our account needs to identify the local social environments through which action is structured and projected: the inter-personal networks, the systems of rules, the social institutions. The social thus has to do with the behaviorally, cognitively, and materially embodied reality of social institutions.An institution, we might say, is an embodied set of rules, incentives, and opportunities that have the potential of influencing agents\u2019 choices and behavior.   An institution is a complex of socially embodied powers, limitations, and opportunities within which individuals pursue their lives and goals. A property system, a legal system, and a professional baseball league all represent examples of institutions.   Institutions have effects that are in varying degrees independent from the individual or \u201clarger\u201d than the individual. Each of these social entities is embodied in the social states of a number of actors\u2014their beliefs, intentions, reasoning, dispositions, and histories. Actors perform their actions within the context of social frameworks represented as rules, institutions, and organizations, and their actions and dispositions embody the causal effectiveness of those frameworks. And institutions influence individuals by offering incentives and constraints on their actions, by framing the knowledge and information on the basis of which they choose, and by conveying sets of normative commitments (ethical, religious, interpersonal) that influence individual action.It is important to emphasize that ML affirms the existence of social constructs beyond the purview of the individual actor or group.  Political institutions exist\u2014and they are embodied in the actions and states of officials, citizens, criminals, and opportunistic others.  These institutions have real effects on individual behavior and on social processes and outcomes\u2014but always mediated through the structured circumstances of agency of the myriad participants in these institutions and the affected society.  This perspective emphasizes the contingency of social processes, the mutability of social structures over space and time, and the variability of human social systems (norms, urban arrangements, social practices, and so on).It is interesting to consider how the timing of a routine social event can have a major effect on outcomes.  Malcolm Gladwell observes that the most talented Canadian hockey players in the NHL are disproportionately likely to have birthdays in the months of January or February in his recent book, Outliers: The Story of Success.  Observers of the current US presidential election may speculate that, if the financial crisis of September had occurred in May, the outcome of the election might have been different.   The generation of Americans born around 1915 are much like those born around 1945 -- except for the searing experience their generation had of the great depression.The lesson to be drawn here might seem to be the obvious and trivial one -- context matters in human affairs.  Because youth hockey leagues define the age of a player based on his age on December 31, the January children have a major advantage in size and physical development over the November children.  And this advantage creates a small headstart that amplifies over time.  The fact that the financial crisis of 2008 created a major disadvantage for the McCain ticket less than 60 days ahead of the election made it very difficult for the candidate to recover in the polls.  The cohort experience of poverty and insecurity made the 1920 generation much more risk averse than the 1950 generation.  So context and the timing of contextual events matters.But perhaps the importance of the calendar goes deeper than this.  In an earlier posting I discussed Victor Lieberman's discovery of an unexpected synchronicity of political change at the far ends of Eurasia, over the course of a millenium.  We tried to understand this pattern in terms of hypothetical social mechanisms that might have produced these parallels.  But what is striking about the example is not simply the fact that there must have been underlying causal mechanisms; it is that the result is a weakly synchronized system of events -- that is, a system of events with a regular temporal association -- that might never have been noticed.What this suggests to me is that the social sciences can profitably give more attention to the temporal features of social phenomena -- the simultaneous experiences a group of people would have had in virtue of being part of the same age cohort, the temporal parallels that might exist between the rise of a mass ideology and the sales of particular books, the accidents of simultaneity that have major repercussions decades later.  Causal analysis implicitly imposes a temporal structure on events (causes precede effects).  But often the research goal is to strip away the particular timing and temporal context, and to treat causal structures purely abstractly.  And this means deliberately taking causal pairs out of their particular temporal contexts and comparing them with temporally disconnected alternative examples.Andrew Abbott takes up some aspects of these issues in \"Conceptions of Time and Events in Social Science Methods\" in Time Matters: On Theory and Method.  And William Sewell's critique of some forms of causal reasoning in comparative historical sociology in \"Three Temporalities\" in Logics of History: Social Theory and Social Transformation is highly relevant as well."}, {"title": "Unequal polities", "date": "Friday, October 31, 2008", "text": "Most nations are at least nominally based on the idea of the legal equality of all citizens. This commitment provides a salient pathway through which even the most disadvantaged groups can pursue their goal of achieving greater equality for themselves and their communities, consistent with the defining values of the nation.  Some countries, however, have embodied legal differences among groups of their citizens based on the religion or ethnicity of the person. And in these circumstances, pariah groups have no pathway -- legal or moral -- through which to attempt to create a non-violent pathway towards greater social justice for themselves.Malaysia is a striking example of the latter circumstance. Its constitution and legal system give fundamental privileges to members of the Malay majority, referred to as \"Bumiputra\" privilege, and accord more limited rights and opportunities to non-Malay groups (Indian, Chinese, Christian, other).  It is a polity based on differential rights for different ethnic and religious groups.  Many of the most desirable opportunities in Malaysian society -- in employment, government office, contracting, and education -- are reserved or prioritized for Malays, defined as a racial group.  It is hard to see how such a political system, defined on the premise of significant legal and economic inequality across different groups, could be justified to members of the subordinate groups.  And, in fact, large street demonstrations in 2007 by the Indian community marked an exceptional indication of the discontent these policies create, and the lack of legitimacy these policies create in the whole population.The question here is a fairly specific one: how can a polity founded on these sorts of invidious and permanent distinctions among groups of its citizens remain stable? Is it possible to generate any variety of \"political legitimacy\" across the whole population that contributes to political stability in these circumstances of extreme constitutional inequality among ethnic groups?  How can the government maintain its power and ability to govern?In the case of Malaysia the answer to the question about governing seems to be a combination of institution-rigging, force, and intimidation of the large ethnic populations. The constitution sets the stage with its stipulation of Bumiputra privilege. And electoral and parliamentary rules pretty much guarantee a permanent and large Malay majority in the parliament for parties such as the UMNO. So the political rules entrench the political hegemony of the Malay majority. This means that minority ethnic groups and parties have no hope of gaining progress towards legal equality of rights of citizenship through the legal process.And this is where force and intimidation come in. It would seem that the strategy of mass demonstration and protest would be a natural recourse for large ethnic groups in Malaysia. But the state has made it clear that it will quickly suppress demonstrations with force -- in fact, the 2007 demonstrations were striking by their rarity in Malaysian public life.But there is a deeper and more sinister kind of force in the air as well. This is the threat of largescale \"race riots\" directed against Malaysia's Indian and Chinese communities. The riots of 1969 were vicious and destructive, and they are remembered. The threat of pogrom and ethnic cleansing by Malays against Indian and Chinese Malaysians is not far from the surface and it is taken seriously.  Rhetoric by UNMO politicians in speeches before parliament reinforce this sense of threat.The theoretical questions at issue here can be posed from two angles -- the state and the group.  From the state's point of view, the question is whether it is possible to navigate the fundamental conflict of interest that is created between Malays and the rest of Malaysian society through some combination of minor accommodation and the threat of repression.  Can a consensus politics, backed by the perennial threat of force, emerge from this kind of fundamental inequality across groups?  From the point of view of the large Indian or Chinese Malaysian populations, the question is whether there are tactics of collective action and popular mobilization that might allow them to pursue their demands of social and political equality effectively.  Can they turn the tables on the Malay government?  Can they gradually create the conditions in which the Malaysian state is compelled to accept the fundamental premises of a just civil society -- equality of all citizens and free rights of political participation for all?Here is a link to an independent Malaysian news source that many Malaysians have confidence in."}, {"title": "Is there such a thing as human nature?", "date": "Thursday, October 30, 2008", "text": "People often make claims about \"human nature.\"  For example -- \"It is a part of human nature to be egoistic.\"  \"Human beings are naturally acquisitive.\"  \"Cooperation is a natural human instinct.\"  \"Human nature defines the way we learn language.\"  \"Violence is natural.\"  What would human nature look like?  To start with a preliminary definition, we might say that human nature is a relatively fixed set of characteristics of psychology, motivation, and cognition that are not the product of learning.  Or, at a slightly greater remove from behavior, we might include innate capacities that can be triggered by appropriate experiences, but may also remain latent if those experiences are not encountered.  (This is roughly the way that Noam Chomsky thinks about language competence in Aspects of the Theory of Syntax.)  When people have identified some psychological characteristics as being part of human nature, they usually have had one of three things in mind.  First, thinkers have sometimes held that there are \"innate ideas\" -- beliefs and concepts that are hard-wired and are not learned through experience.  For example, Kant holds that the ideas of space, time, and causality are a necessary part of any intelligent being's mental equipment.  Second, thinkers have sometimes postulated that there are certain visceral emotions that come with the normal human equipment -- for example, fear of loud noises, love of infants, or empathy.  And third, people sometimes assert that there are some fundamental dispositions to behavior that are a part of \"human nature\" -- for example, being self-interested, being amenable to the appeal of fairness, being monogomous or its opposites.The logical contrary to the idea that there is a human nature, is the idea that human beings are simply general-purpose \"learning machines,\" equipped with a pretty impressive inference engine and neurophysiological computer; so all our beliefs, emotions, and dispositions to behavior are learned through experience.  (Even on this approach there is something \"fixed\" in the human apparatus -- the set of computational processes through which learning occurs.  But everything else is variable and dependent upon the environment in which learning takes place.)This is the \"tabula rasa\" theory -- the idea that the mind is a blank slate upon which experience inscribes specific knowledge and dispositions to behavior.  On this approach, the mind consists of an extended inductive logic engine (permitting the acquisition of beliefs about the world); a \"culture-acquisition device\" (permitting the absorption of linguistic and normative practices from the surrounding community); and a \"scenarios and actions\" guidebook assembly kit (permitting the construction of a growing list of commands along the lines of \"when such-and-so happens, do thus-and-so\").   Altogether this being has the ability to gather empirical and causal beliefs, gain language and values, and acquire a set of guidelines about how to behave.  And, according to the tabula rasa theory, the content of each of these attainments is governed only by the feedback of experience.  Supply a different environment, and you get different knowledge, values, and behavior.It is evident that much of an adult's mental makeup is the result of his/her history and the enveloping culture within which the individual has developed.  Learning is a fundamental aspect of human life, and it occurs at virtually every level; modes of reasoning, self-control, willingness to cooperate with others, and definition of the appropriate distance of separation between two people in a conversation are all human performances that are culturally and individually variable.  They are the outcome of social learning.  Further, human culture fundamentally influences human behavior -- and culture is only transmitted through lived experience.The question of human nature is whether there are any dispositions or behavioral outcomes that are largely independent from these learning and developmental processes.  Are there any social behaviors, emotions, or impulses that are an innate part of the human mental system?  The sociobiologists have offered one line of analysis on this question.  They note that the human mental system -- cognition, emotions, and the control of behavior -- is embodied in an organ that is itself subject to natural selection and evolution, the central nervous system.  So it seems logical to expect that this system will have acquired some socially specific characteristics through the evolution of hominids and modern human beings.  Edward O. Wilson took a controversial stab at the question in On Human Nature.  And Richard Dawkins tried to get a handle on the evolutionary biology of cooperation in The Selfish Gene.  Each book has proven controversial over the decades since publication -- largely on grounds of the complaint that they are somewhat reductionist in their disregard of the causal importance of culture in the behaviors they describe.  (See, for example, Marshall Sahlins, The Use and Abuse of Biology: An Anthropological Critique of Sociobiology.)  But surely the foundation of the approach is a valid one: the human brain has been shaped through natural selection; skill in social relationships is relevant to reproductive success; so it is logical to expect that there has been specialized brain development around the challenges of social interaction.  Allan Gibbard's Wise Choices, Apt Feelings: A Theory of Normative Judgment explores these ideas in some detail and in a way that is exempt from the accusation of reductionism.The strongest case for mental features that might be part of human nature concerns what might be referred to as the social emotions and the foundations of social cognition.  The social emotions might include a disposition towards reciprocity, an innate responsiveness towards infants, and a deep grounding of empathy for the suffering of other human beings.  It is not difficult to put together an analysis that would show that these psychological traits might have differential reproductive advantage for the individuals who carry these traits.  And the foundations of social cognition also seem to qualify as candidates for features of human nature as well: the ability to recognize and remember faces, the ability to \"read\" emotions and mental states in the speech and behavior of others, and the ability to quickly apprehend a social setting, for example.  Here too there seem to be the makings of a selection-based explanation of the proliferation of these traits through a population; these cognitive abilities surely confer some reproductive benefits on the individuals who possess them.  Another example of a mental trait that might be an enduring component of human nature is the ability to plan future actions, considering alternatives and choosing a series of actions that brings about the future outcome that the individual has selected.  The cognitive abilities that underlie planning would appear to confer substantial evolutionary advantage.What seems not to be justified is any form of simplistic \"social Darwinism\", leading to the assumptions of narrow self-interest as a component of permanent human nature.  Here the error is an over-quick inference from the proposition that \"evolution favors organisms that out-reproduce their fellows at a given time\" to the conclusion that \"organisms that maximize local self-interest will out-reproduce their fellows.\"  This inference is unjustified, since we can readily describe models of populations in which reciprocity and altruism out-reproduce egoism and narrow self-interest."}, {"title": "Polling and social knowledge", "date": "Wednesday, October 29, 2008", "text": "Here's a pretty interesting graphic from Pollster.com:As you can see, the graph summarizes a large number of individual polls measuring support for the two major party candidates from January 1 to October 26.  The site indicates that it includes all publicly available polls during the time period.  Each poll result is represented with two markers -- blue for Obama and red for McCain.  The red and blue trend lines are \"trend estimates\" based on local regressions for the values of the corresponding measurements for a relatively short interval of time (the site doesn't explicitly say what the time interval is).  So, for example, the trend estimate for August 1 appears to be approximately 47%:42% for the two candidates.  As the site explains, 47% is not the average of poll results for Obama on August 1; instead, it is a regression result based on the trend of all of Obama's polling results for the previous several days.There are a couple of things to observe about this graph and the underlying methodology.  First, it's a version of the \"wisdom of the crowd\" idea, in that it arrives at an estimate based on a large number of less-reliable individual observations (the dozen or so polling results for the previous several days).  Each of the individual poll results has an estimate-of-error which may be in the range of 3-5 percentage points; the hope is that the aggregate result has a higher degree of precision (a narrower error bar).Second, the methodology attempts to incorporate an estimate of the direction and rate of movement of public opinion, by incorporating trend information based on the prior several days' polling results.Third, it is evident that there is likely to be a range of degrees of credibility assigned to the various component polls; but the methodology doesn't assign greater weight to \"more credible\" polls.  Ordinary readers might be inclined to assign greater weight to a Gallup poll or a CBS poll than a Research2000 or a DailyKos poll; but the methodology treats all results equally.  Likewise, the critical reader might assign more credibility to a live phone-based poll than an internet-based or automated phone poll; but this version of the graph includes all polls.  (On the website it is possible to filter out internet-generated or automated phone polling results; this doesn't seem to change the shape of the results noticeably.)There is also a fundamental question of validity and reliability that the critical reader needs to ask: how valid and reliable are these estimates for a particular point in time?  That is, how likely is it that the trend estimate of support for either candidate on a particular day is within a small range of error of the actual value?  I assume there is some statistical method for estimating probable error for this methodology, though it doesn't appear to be explained on the website.  But fundamentally, the question is whether we have a rational basis for drawing any of the inferences that the graph suggests -- for example, that Obama's lead over McCain is narrowing in the final 14 days of the race.Finally, there is the narrative that we can extract from the graph, and it tells an interesting story.  From January through March candidate Obama has a lead over candidate McCain; but of course both candidates are deeply engaged in their own primary campaigns.  At the beginning of April the candidates are roughly tied at 45%.  From April through September Obama rises slowly and maintains support at about 48%, while McCain falls in support until he reaches a low point of 43% in the beginning of August.  Then the conventions take place in August and early September -- and McCain's numbers bump up to the point where Obama and McCain cross in the first week of September.  McCain takes a brief lead in the trend estimates.  His ticket seems to derive more benefit from his \"convention bump\" than Obama does.  But in the early part of September the national financial crisis leaps to center stage and the two candidates fare very differently.  Obama's support rises steeply and McCain's support falls at about the same rate, opening up a 7 percentage point gap in the trend estimates by the middle of October.  From the middle of October the race begins to tighten; McCain's support picks up and Obama's begins to dip slightly at the end of October.  But the election looms -- the trend estimates tell a story that's hard to read in any way but \"too late, too little\" for the McCain campaign.And, of course, it will be fascinating to see where things stand a week from today.Here is the explanation that the website offers of its methodology:[quoting from Pollster.com:]\"Where do the numbers come from?When you hold the mouse pointer over a state, you see a display of the latest \"trend estimate\" numbers from our charts of all available public polls for that race. The numbers for each candidate correspond to the most recent trend estimate -- that is the end point of the trend line that we draw for each candidate. If you click the state on the map, you will be taken to the page on Pollster.com that displays the chart and table of polls results for that race.In most cases, the numbers are not an \"average\" but rather regression based trendlines. The specific methodology depends on the number of polls available.If we have at least 8 public polls, we fit a trend line to the dots represented by each poll using a \"Loess\" iterative locally weighted least squares regression.If we have between 4 and 7 polls, we fit a linear regression trend line (a straight line) to best fit the points.If we have 3 polls or fewer, we calculate a simple average of the available surveys.How do regression trend lines differ from simple averages?Charles Franklin, who created the statistical routines that plot our trend lines, provided the following explanation last year:Our trend estimate is just that, an estimate of the trends and where the race stands as of the latest data available. It is NOT a simple average of recent polling but a \"local regression\" estimate of support as of the most recent poll. So if you are trying to [calculate] our trend estimates from just averaging the recent polls, you won't succeed.Here is a way to think about this: suppose the last 5 polls in a race are 25, 27, 29, 31 and 33. Which is a better estimate of where the race stands today? 29 (the mean) or 33 (the local trend)? Since support has risen by 2 points in each successive poll, our estimator will say the trend is currently 33%, not the 29% the polls averaged over the past 2 or 3 weeks during which the last 5 polls were taken. Of course real data are more noisy than my example, so we have to fit the trend in a more complicated way than the example, but the logic is the same. Our trend estimates are local regression predictions, not simple averaging. If the data have been flat for a while, the trend and the mean will be quite close to each other. But if the polls are moving consistently either up or down, the trend estimate will be a better estimate of opinion as of today while the simple average will be an estimate of where the race was some 3 polls ago (for a 5 poll average-- longer ago as more polls are included in the average.) And that's why we estimate the trends the way we do.\""}, {"title": "Causal mechanisms", "date": "Tuesday, October 28, 2008", "text": "The central tenet of causal realism is a thesis about causal mechanisms or causal powers. We can only assert that there is a causal relationship between X and Y if we can offer a credible hypothesis of the sort of underlying mechanism that might connect X to the occurrence of Y.  The sociologist Mats Ekstr\u00f6m puts the view this way: \u201cthe essence of causal analysis is ... the elucidation of the processes that generate the objects, events, and actions we seek to explain\u201d (Ekstrom 1992, p. 115).  Authors who have urged the centrality of causal mechanisms for both explanatory and purposes include Nancy Cartwright (Nature's Capacities and Their Measurements), Jon Elster (Explaining Social Behavior: More Nuts and Bolts for the Social Sciences), Rom Harr\u00e9 (Causal Powers), and Wesley Salmon (Scientific Explanation and the Causal Structure of the World).  (Hedstrom and Swedberg's collection, Social Mechanisms: An Analytical Approach to Social Theory, is a useful source.  An important advocate for a realist interpretation of science is Roy Bhaskar's A Realist Theory of Science.)Nancy Cartwright is one of the most original voices within contemporary philosophy of science. Cartwright places real causal mechanisms at the center of her account of scientific knowledge. As she and John Dupr\u00e9 put the point, \u201cthings and events have causal capacities: in virtue of the properties they possess, they have the power to bring about other events or states\u201d (Dupr\u00e9 and Cartwright 1988). Cartwright argues, for the natural sciences, that the concept of a real causal connection among a set of events is more fundamental than the concept of a law of nature. And most fundamentally, she argues that identifying causal relations requires substantive theories of the causal powers (capacities, in her language) that govern the entities in question. Causal relations cannot be directly inferred from facts about association among variables. As she puts the point, \u201cNo reduction of generic causation to regularities is possible\u201d (Nature's Capacities and Their Measurements, p. 90). The importance of this idea for sociological research is profound; it confirms the notion shared by many researchers that attribution of social causation depends inherently on the formulation of good, middle-level theories about the real causal properties of various social forces and entities.What is a causal mechanism?  Consider this formulation: a causal mechanism is a sequence of events, conditions, and processes leading from the explanans to the explanandum (Varieties Of Social Explanation, p. 15).  A causal relation exists between X and Y if and only if there is a set of causal mechanisms that connect X to Y. This is an ontological premise, asserting that causal mechanisms are real and are the legitimate object of scientific investigation.Aage S\u00f8rensen summarizes a causal realist position for sociology in these words: \u201cSociological ideas are best reintroduced into quantitative sociological research by focusing on specifying the mechanisms by which change is brought about in social processes\u201d (S\u00f8rensen 1998, p. 264).  He argues that sociology requires better integration of theory and evidence.  Central to an adequate explanatory theory, however, is the specification of the mechanism that is hypothesized to underlie a given set of observations.  \u201cDeveloping theoretical ideas about social processes is to specify some concept of what brings about a certain outcome\u2014a change in political regimes, a new job, an increase in corporate performance, \u2026  The development of the conceptualization of change amounts to proposing a mechanism for a social process\u201d (239-240).  S\u00f8rensen makes the critical point that one cannot select a statistical model for analysis of a set of data without first asking the question, what in the nature of the mechanisms we wish to postulate to link the influences of some variables with others?   Rather, it is necessary to have a hypothesis of the mechanisms that link the variables before we can arrive at a justified estimate of the relative importance of the causal variables in bringing about the outcome.The general nature of the mechanisms that underlie sociological causation has been very much the subject of debate.  Two broad approaches may be identified: agent-based models and social influence models.  The former follow the strategy of aggregating the results of individual-level choices into macro-level outcomes; the latter attempt to identify the factors that work behind the backs of agents to influence their choices. (S\u00f8rensen refers to these as \u201cpull\u201d and \u201cpush\u201d models; S\u00f8rensen, 1998.)  Thomas Schelling\u2019s apt title Micromotives and Macrobehavior captures the logic of the former approach, and his work profoundly illustrates the sometimes highly unpredictable results of the interactions of locally rational behavior.  Jon Elster has also shed light on the ways in which the tools of rational choice theory support the construction of largescale sociological explanations (The Cement of Society: A Survey of Social Order).   The second approach (the \u201cpush\u201d approach) attempts to identify socially salient influences such as race, gender, educational status, and to provide detailed accounts of how these factors influence or constrain individual trajectories\u2014thereby affecting sociological outcomes.Emphasis on causal mechanisms for adequate social explanation has several salutary effects on sociological method. It takes us away from uncritical reliance on uncritical statistical models. But it also may take us away from excessive emphasis on large-scale classification of events into revolutions, democracies, or religions, and toward more specific analysis of the processes and features that serve to discriminate among instances of large social categories. Charles Tilly emphasizes this point in his arguments for causal narratives in comparative sociology (Tilly 1995). He writes, \u201cI am arguing that regularities in political life are very broad, indeed transhistorical, but do not operate in the form of recurrent structures and processes at a large scale. They consist of recurrent causes which in different circumstances and sequences compound into highly variable but nonetheless explicable effects\u201d (Tilly 1995, p. 1601).CitationsDupr\u00e9, John, and Nancy Cartwright. 1988.

The power that a person or group possesses can only be defined in relation to the domain of persons over whom this power can be wielded and the set of social resources that constitute the levers of this power. Power must be characterized in terms of domain and mechanisms. The question here is whether there are other social concepts that have a similar conceptual geography. If so, this may give us a better basis for explaining the concept of power.Consider these possible sibling concepts: status, affluence, charisma, eloquence, funny ... Each of these is what we might call an \"influence\" concept.  It stipulates a capacity to bring about a particular kind of effect in other persons. It follows that these concepts are inherently relational; we cannot define \"charisma\" or \"eloquence\" without explicitly or implicitly specifying the group of people who respond to these qualities.  Second, conveying influence requires a mechanism of influence; and in fact each of these examples depends upon some set of qualities or assets through which the individual with the property is able to exert this influence (admiration, laughter, persuasion, willingness to follow, willingness to obey).Further, each of these characteristics is social in one way or another. \"Status\" depends on an audience that is prepared to \"read\" a person with certain attributes as possessing a certain status, and it depends on the individual being socially situated on such a way as to acquire those tags (the Mercedes, the $600 haircut, ...). \"Affluence\" depends on having resources adequate to support consumption noticeably superior to that of most other people in this social setting -- in fact, it is doubly social, in that it depends upon comparison with other consumers and on the affluent person's having access to socially defined resources, which implies a particular situation within a particular set of social relations (corporation, pirate gang, government bureau).Power differs from these other influence terms in several ways. Most crucially, power is less dependent on the social psychology of others and more dependent upon material resources. Status and eloquence are pretty much in the eye of the beholder, whereas the power of a criminal boss depends largely on his ability to marshall force. Affluence is similar in this respect, while \"funny\" is more similar to status.So an important distinguishing feature within this conceptual space of \"social influence\" concepts is whether the attributes needed to wield influence are personal psychological traits or external, socially defined assets. David Letterman is funny because he has a set of capabilities -- quick verbal wit, droll timing, sarcastic imagination, extreme facial motility -- that we are culturally prepared to find amusing. These traits are not inherently funny -- presenting the same skit to a group of Navajo ranchers might elicit only puzzled looks. But in our comedy culture, the person who has Letterman's qualities but at a less adept level will not succeed in being funny. Al Capone was powerful because he had violent men available to do his bidding. This wasn't a feature primarily of his psychological characteristics but rather his particular social location and the material resources of violence he could call upon.We might consider how charisma fits in this analysis, especially since this concept has almost as common appeal in political analysis as power. We might say that a charismatic person is one who has the ability to influence other people to want to act in the ways he/she asks of them. This influence is often described as sub-rational and sub-conscious: followers act out the exhortations of their charismatic leader out of emotional allegiance rather than rational judgment. So the capacities required of the charismatic leader are features of personality and performance -- the charismatic person needs the qualities that permit him/her to inspire followers. In this way charisma is similar to being funny. But these capabilities also give the leader the ability to influence followers beyond their rational will -- which makes charisma more similar to power.So we might summarize this analysis in application to the concept of power along these lines:X has power =df  {X has access to social resources Ri that permits him/her to compel the behavior of persons Pj}X is funny =df {X has skills and personality traits Ci such that X's performance typically elicits laughter from persons Pj}X has charisma =df {X has skills and personality traits Ci such that X's performance typically elicits admiration and loyalty from persons Pj}"}, {"title": "Labor mobilization", "date": "Saturday, October 25, 2008", "text": "Workers are a group who ought to be readily prone to mobilization. They are brought together into proximity with each other in large numbers in factories, rail stations, ports, and other workplaces. The circumstances of production usually give them causes around which to gather -- health and safety issues in the workplace, bullying or disrespectful treatment by supervisors, petty or demeaning work rules. And the business incentives created for owners and managers assure an environment in which workers are likely to have economic grievances, ranging from low pay to withheld wages to pension fund corruption and default. So the conditions for mobilization of workers in protest and advocacy seem propitious almost everywhere. And yet passive acceptance seems about as common as spontaneous or organized protest and resistance. So what other factors come into play? What explains historical patterns of worker passivity and protest? And going a bit further, what factors influence the form that protest takes when it occurs?Marx's answers to these questions are well known. The development of industrial capitalism brought about the objective conditions for a militant working class identity. Capitalism increasingly erased differences among artisans and other producers. It conducted a process of commodification of labor that increasingly place all producers in the condition of wage labor. And the imperatives of profits pushed the industrial system towards worse working conditions, lower wages, and a degraded social position. The emergence of a unified class identity and a readiness for protest was inevitable.  \"Workers of the world, unite.  You have nothing to lose but your chains.\"Marx's story here isn't a fantasy. There are real institutional processes embedded in this story that correspond pretty well to the historical experience of labor and capital in many countries and times. But neither is it an iron law of social development. Each country's experience of development is somewhat different -- sometimes in major ways. And crucially, the result Marx expected -- a steadily rising tide of radical worker mobilization -- has certainly not occurred. So, once again, what are the more specific and local factors that influence the occurrence and form of worker mobilization?One of Charles Tilly's central ideas about the occurrence of protest is its historical character.  Protest movements have histories that form their present.  Tilly emphasizes the central role that traditions and repertoires of protest play in virtually every instance. Protest is not simply the automatic response to exploitation and bad conditions. Rather, protest is an act of collective agency. And this means that outrage and protest must be conceptualized and placed into a practical context. So traditions of protest and grievance play a key role in determining the occurrence and form of mobilization. Parades, strikes, boycotts, road blockages, and petitions all represent forms of the \"art of resistance\" that have developed differently in different traditions of popular politics.  (See The Contentious French for more on this.)E. P. Thompson's focus on the particulars of the group identity that has formed represents another crucial factor that helps explain differences across historical settings. Classes make themselves -- and they make themselves in different ways. William Sewell's treatment of the guild consciousness of nineteenth century workers in Marseilles illustrates the point (Work and Revolution in France: The Language of Labor from the Old Regime to 1848).  Historians and sociologists can observe these processes of identity in formation through a variety of ways -- both historically and in the present.  And these differences in consciousness formation have consequences for mobilization and action.  For example, C. K. Lee argues that China's workers today, in both \"rustbelt\" and \"sunbelt\" settings, have absorbed a set of attitudes towards the moral importance of their legal protections within existing Chinese law, that profoundly influences the form that protests take Against the Law: Labor Protests in China's Rustbelt and Sunbelt.Resource mobilization theory highlights another crucial factor that helps explain differences in mobilization across similar material settings. For a group to successfully constitute itself as an effective collectivity, it needs to have access to a range of resources. Communication requires resources; organization requires fulltime activists; propaganda requires access to printing assets; and so forth.  So we can get a better picture of the status of labor mobilization in a particular setting, by examining the resources and opportunities for collective action that exist for potential activists.Organization is a factor that also makes a large difference in the occurrence and form of mobilization. The presence of the IWW plays a key role in Howard Kimeldorf's account of Philadelphia dock workers (Battling for American Labor: Wobblies, Craft Workers, and the Making of the Union Movement). The CCP is key in Lucien Bianco's trarment of peasant mobilization in China (Peasants Without the Party: Grass-Root Movements in Twentieth-Century China). Organizations permit a movement to acquire the coordination of effort required by successful mobilization. And it permits \"escalation\" -- extension of mobilization to a broader territory or a broader set of alliances.It is also important to recognize the role that agency and strategic interaction play in the unfolding of mobilization. Struggle involved multiple parties responding to each other's actions. And the outcome may be entirely unforeseen; state actions can both ameliorate the causes of worker grievance (through more vigilant regulation, for example) and deepen worker grievance (through a legal system that systematically disregards worker claims) -- and may even do so at the same time.A final factor that needs mention is the state. Actions and policies by the state can have a large effect on mobilization at several levels. Through regulation it can reduce grievances -- pension fund abuse, health and safety issues, intimidation in the workplace. And by providing a substantial social security system -- unemployment benefits, access to healthcare, decent treatment of the elderly -- it can blunt some of the aggressively harmful tendencies of the unbridled private system that would otherwise lead to explosive protest. Finally, the state can use its coercive and legal power to channel protest in one direction rather than another.So where does this take us with respect to the original question -- what explains patterns of worker mobilization? We've noticed some general circumstances that are conducive to worker activism and mobilization. But this account also highlights a wide suite of independent factors that influence mobilization, both up and down. This treatment reinforces the view that social change is highly contingent. And it shows the irreplaceable role to be played by good, specific works of historical sociology. No comprehensive theory suffices for any particular case. Instead, we need to discover the particular ways in which general processes and more contingent factors come together to forge a particular historical juncture. (An influential recent book that tries to work out where workers' movements might be going in the twenty-first century is Beverly Silver's Forces of Labor: Workers' Movements and Globalization Since 1870.)"}, {"title": "What do polls tell us?", "date": "Friday, October 24, 2008", "text": "We're all interested in the opinions of vast numbers of strangers -- potential voters, investors, consumers, college students, or home owners. Our interest is often a practical one -- we would like to know how the election is likely to go, whether the stock market will rebound, whether an influenza season will develop into a pandemic, or whether the shops in our cities and malls will have higher or lower demand in the holiday season. And so we turn to polls and surveys of attitudes and preferences -- consumer confidence surveys, voter preference polls, surveys of public health behaviors, surveys of investor confidence. And tools such as pollster.com aggregate and disaggregate the data to allow us to make more refined judgments about what the public's mood really is.  But how valid is the knowledge that is provided by surveys and polls?  To what extent do they accurately reflect an underlying social reality of public opinion?  And to what extent does this knowledge provide a basis for projecting future collective behavior (including voting)?There are several important factors to consider.First is the heterogeneity of social characteristics across a population at virtually every level of scale -- including especially attitudes and beliefs. No matter what slice of the social demographic we select -- selecting for specific age, race, religion, and income, for example -- there will be a range of opinions across the resulting group. Groups don't suddenly become homogeneous when we find the right way of partitioning the population.Second is an analogous point about plasticity over time. The attitudes and preferences of individuals and groups change over time -- often rapidly. In polling I suppose this is referred to as \"voter volatility\" -- the susceptibility of a group to changing its preferences in response to changing information and other stimulation.  And the fact appears to be that opinions and beliefs change rapidly during periods of decision-making.  So knowing that 65% of Hispanic voters preferred X over Y on October 10 doesn't imply much about the preferences of this group two weeks later. This is precisely what the campaigns are trying to accomplish -- a new message or commercial that shifts preferences for an extended group.Third are questions having to do with the honesty of the responses that a survey or poll elicits. Do subjects honestly record their answers; do they conceal responses they may be ashamed of (the Bradley effect); do they exaggerate their income or personal happiness or expected grade in a course? There are survey techniques intended to address these possibilities (obscuring the point of a question, coming back to a question in a different way); but the possibility of untruthful responses raises an important problem for us when we try to assess the realism of a poll or survey.Fourth are the standard technical issues having to do with sampling and population estimation: how large a set of observations are required to arrive at an estimate of a population value with 95% confidence? And what measures need to be taken to assure a random sample and avoid sample bias? For example, if polling is done based solely on landline phone numbers, does this introduce either an age bias or an income bias if it is true that affluent young people are more likely to have only cell phones?So, then, what is the status of opinion surveys and polls as a source of knowledge about social reality? Do public opinion surveys tell us something about objective underlying facts about a population? What does a finding like \"65% of Iowans favor subsidies for corn ethanol\" based on a telephone poll of 1000 citizens tell us about the opinions of the full population of the state of Iowa?Points made above lead to several important cautions.  First, the reality of public opinion and preference itself is fluid and heterogeneous. The properties we're trying to measure vary substantially across any subgroup we might define -- pro/con assessments about a candidate's judgment, for example. So the measurement of a particular question is simply an average value for the group as a whole, with the possibility of a substantial variance within the group. And second, the opinions themselves may change rapidly over time at the individual level -- with the result that an observation today may be very different from a measurement next week. Third, it is a credible hypothesis that demographic factors such as race, income, or gender may affect attitudes and opinions; so there is a basis for thinking that data disaggregated by these variables may demonstrate more uniformity and consistency. Finally, the usual cautions about sample size and sample bias are always relevant; a poorly designed study tells us almost nothing about the underlying reality.But what about the acid test: to what extent can a series of polls and surveys performed over many subgroups over an extended period of time, help to forecast the collective behavior of the group as a whole?  Can we use this kind of information to arrive at credible estimates of an election in two weeks, or the likely demand for automobiles in 2009, or the willingness of a whole population to accept public health guidelines in a time of pandemic flu?"}, {"title": "Mapping social data", "date": "Thursday, October 23, 2008", "text": "Fig. 1.

The comparisons of patterns are very revealing.  Figure 4 is the most familiar to us -- it shows the geographical distribution of the mortgage crisis across the country.

For example, the \"rust belt\" of Michigan, Ohio, and Indiana shows a pretty dense set of high mortgage delinquency counties.

Mississippi and Louisiana jump off the map on the poverty and inequality maps, and on the bank card default map as well.

In some sense we have first-hand knowledge of all this -- we are the ones who experience the situation of going through a difficult job interview, of feeling angry at an aggressive driver, of trying to decide what to do in a moment of important choice, of remembering an incident that occurred months or years earlier.  We're not in the position that Thomas Nagel assumed when he tried to reason about what it feels like to be a bat (\"What is it Like to Be a Bat?\" in Ned Block, ed. Readings in Philosophy of Psychology v.1). And yet we have a surprisingly thin set of theories of what is involved in this active experiencing of the world as a thinking, acting person -- and some of our theories are obviously wrong. So why is it so hard to formulate a clear, simple philosophy of the mind -- an overarching sketch of how various mental states and processes relate to each other within the functioning person?One sign of the confusion this subject engenders is the great variety of terms we use to capture what we're talking about: the mind, the agent, the self, the person, the subject, the knower, the actor, the ego, the conscious being, the soul. Each of these terms might be said to refer to the same thing -- the experiencing, wanting, acting human individual. And yet each highlights a different aspect of the topic: the act of perception, the gathering of knowledge, the experience of wants and desires, the fact of subjectivity, the problematic unity of the self, the process of decision making and action, the causality of the emotions, the situation of awareness.  And, sure enough, there is a separate strand of philosophical thinking about each of these perspectives.So here is my question: is it possible to sketch a basic theory of the conscious human being that allows us to assign a place to each of the mental activities and processes that we think are taking place; and can the various parts of psychology and neuroscience give us greater understanding of how this system works and greater confidence in the theories we advance?  Can we arrive at a schematic but phenomenologically and behaviorally adequate sketch of how these bits of mental activity and process fit together?  The diagrams above are pulled from the web with the search term \"models of mind.\"  They illustrate some very different ways of representing these different aspects or features of the person's mental experience, and they are, in some sense, the sorts of theories I'm looking for in this posting.  But none is close to being satisfactory.  So the question is, can we arrive at a sketch that can be defended on the basis of the evidence of logic, phenomenology, and behavior?I think this was a large part of William James's goal in writing The Principles of Psychology.  James wanted to explore the complexities of human mental life as presented through introspection; and he wanted to do this in a scientific fashion.  (See a very good article from SEP on James here.)   James describes his scientific goals in these terms in the first few sentences of the work:Psychology is the Science of Mental Life, both of its phenomena and their conditions.  The phenomena are such things as we call feelings, desires, cognitions, reasonings, decisions, and the like; and, superficially considered, their variety and complexity is such as to leave a chaotic impression of the observer.Scientific psychology left this program behind almost a century ago, although parts of the effort are reflected in current cognitive psychology and social psychology.  But it isn't sufficient to simply legislate the problem away; it is impossible to deny that memories, impulses, intuitions, aversions, feelings, desires, emotions, daydreams, and calculations all play roles in human mental life and action.   So we need to have at least a sketchy idea of how we think the mental world we experience is organized and how this soup of mental life is related to action and behavior.The effort to find concepts and frameworks in terms of which to analyze human mental life has been a continuing part of philosophy, in the fields of the philosophy of mind, the philosophy of psychology, and cognitive philosophy.  One place to start on this large field is the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy, with articles on folk psychology, mental representation, the computational theory of mind, memory, and Merleau-Ponty.  Philosophers have continued to take seriously the questions of consciousness, subjectivity, representation, and thinking.But another place where one can turn in attempting to get a handle on the nature and organization of mental experience is literature.  Great novels often capture a lot of the complexity of ordinary human mental experience in their narrations of individuals as they navigate life: Stavrogin in Dostoevsky's The Possessed, Julien Sorel in Red and Black, Rufus Scott in Baldwin's Another Country.   These are \"interior\" novels -- novels where the author is making a sustained effort to get inside the head of the character, giving the reader a view of the nature of the subjective experience and thoughts that the character undergoes.  And it seems to me that the intellectual work that the author is doing is very similar to the work of a philosopher in grappling with the nature of consciousness: he/she is attempting to arrive at a language that allows for description of these fleeting interior moments, and a framework of observation about how they may fit together -- how passion or jealousy affects action, how calculation interferes with love, how the experience of discrimination colors one's relationships.  These theories aren't necessarily true -- in fact, one of the things we can do as critical readers is to see how well the novelist's framework of mental life holds together from the points of view of consistency and phenomenology -- but they represent significant intellectual efforts at understanding mental life nonetheless.I think the subject is important for understanding the social world, because the subjective, active human individual is the \"molecule\" of social life.  The ways in which individuals reason, act, form beliefs, create affinities, and emote are deeply important to social processes.  And we won't understand many features of social life unless we can make some degree of progress on the problem of formulating an abstract model of the human person."}, {"title": "Greenblatt in the world", "date": "Sunday, October 19, 2008", "text": "I recently read Stephen Greenblatt's brilliant biographical book on Shakespeare, Will in the World: How Shakespeare Became Shakespeare, and I was once again struck by what a large contribution Greenblatt might make to the social sciences. His innovations in literary theory are well known, particularly in his pioneering work on forging \"the new historicism\" (for example, Renaissance Self-Fashioning: From More to Shakespeare).  (Here is a link to a nice website on the new historicism.)  Greenblatt's interpretive imagination, his ability to think clearly and innovatively about identities and meanings, and his remarkable ability to link a series of observations into a startling inference and insight -- these abilities would be most beneficial to the problems associated with \"understanding society.\"  We need some new ways of framing the tasks of understanding social and historical reality -- and Greenblatt's incisive mind provides many new perspectives on these sorts of issues.And, in fact, the idea isn't as far-fetched as it might seem. Greenblatt's contribution to Sherry Ortner's The Fate of \"Culture\": Geertz and Beyond shows his ability to turn ethnographic, as does his book on the writings of the colonial navigators who brought Europe to the new world (Marvelous Possessions: The Wonder of the New World). In each case he demonstrates how fertile the connections are between literary, ethnographic, and historical interpretation.  He is particularly profound when it comes to thinking about social identities -- they ways they are formed and expressed, and the ways they vary across time and place.But let's focus here on what makes Will in the World such an interesting book. Greenblatt does a simply stunning job of constructing an interpretation of Shakespeare's mentality and his creative mind, linking the grainy historical context in which Shakespeare was writing to the brilliance and startling novelties expressed in his plays.  Greenblatt is pursuing a bold ambition here because there is so remarkably little evidence about Shakespeare's life that would serve as the basis for a traditional biography. Moreover, Greenblatt's goal is somewhat different from that of the traditional biographer. He is interested in getting a better understanding of the author's mental and experiential world, based on his personal chronology, many very specific details about England's history during this half century, and a profound knowledge of Shakespeare's writings.Greenblatt freely admits that much of his interpretation exceeds the historical facts.  There are few documents that would directly establish Shakespeare's feelings about his marriage or his family; the situation of the persecution of England's Catholics; or his attitudes towards Marlowe, Greene, and the other brilliant bohemian playwrights of the London scene.  And yet he makes a case for his interpretation that is deeply compelling and evidence-based -- though the evidence is largely internal to Shakespeare's body of writing.  (Even the lack of diaries or personal notes is taken as a kind of evidence -- evidence of the very great danger that the persecutions by the Crown created for anyone suspected of involvement in Catholic conspiracies.  Greenblatt writes vividly of the rows of heads on spikes that would have greeted him as he entered London for the first time -- often the heads of Catholic conspirators.)Another kind of evidence in Greenblatt's case is the collation of knowledge of historical conditions in the mid-sixteenth century in England that we do know quite a bit about -- the availability (or non-availability) of books, the character and content of schooling, the history of the expulsion of the English Jews -- with the series of developmental experiences that Shakespeare certainly went through.  Even if we know next to nothing about Shakespeare's youth, the fact that he is likely to have attended the Stratford grammar school under the tutelage of a Simon Hunt, tells Greenblatt quite a bit about the kinds of drama and history to which he would have been exposed.The Crown's fierce oppression of the Catholics in the early to mid-sixteenth century is a particularly important element of Greenblatt's interpretation of Shakespeare's mentality.  Greenblatt hypothesizes that this period of terror touched Shakespeare and his family fairly closely.  The smashing of Catholic images in churches, the dismissal of the local priests, and the occasional hunt for persistent Catholic practices in private homes all touched Stratford directly.  And John Shakespeare himself had evidently signed a Catholic \"spiritual testament\", discovered in the eighteenth century hidden away between the rafters and ceiling of the Stratford home.  In this setting, Greenblatt considers a scenario for the missing year of Shakespeare's life at the age of 16: he considers that the young man may have served as a private teacher in the household of John Cottam, a prominent secret Catholic in Lancashire.  And there he would have had vivid exposure to the drama surrounding the illicit activist Jesuit priest, Edmund Campion.  (Campion was apprehended, tortured, and executed in 1581.)  Greenblatt finds many traces of this personal history of covert Catholicism in Shakespeare's plots, language, and life.  What I find most thought-provoking in Greenblatt's work here, is his ability to bring history, literature, and life story together into one extended interpretation.  The book sheds light on ordinary life in sixteenth-century England -- rural and town.  In this respect it serves as vivid social history.  And it sheds light on the literature as well -- the many ways in which themes and turns of language can be related to Shakespeare's own itinerary, as well as the astonishing ability the writer had to transform the ordinary into something transcendent."}, {"title": "Marx's historical thinking", "date": "Tuesday, October 14, 2008", "text": "Marx's theories are deeply historical, in that he wants to explain the dynamics of change of large historical formations such as capitalism or feudalism, and he insists on putting social events into historical context. And, of course, Marx is most celebrated for developing a general approach to historical explanation, the theory of historical materialism. But how does Marx do when he treats concrete historical events? How is Marx as an historian?There are surprisingly few extended examples of detailed historical analysis in Marx's writings.  There is Marx's account of \"primitive accumulation\" in English agrarian history in the 17th and 18th centuries in Capital.  There are occasional references to the Roman Empire and classical slavery throughout his work. And there are his important writings about the French urban uprisings during 1848 and its aftermath (The Eighteenth Brumaire and The Civil War in France).  These essays include quite a bit of historical detail -- personalities, events, parties, speeches. But they are closer to political journalism than to careful historical analysis.  They are based primarily upon Marx's personal contemporary observations -- not on the usual historian's studies in archives and secondary sources. They come closer to personal recollections and observations than to a typical historical research product.If there is a unifying theme of interpretation in these articles, it is the idea that the parties and factions pursue programs that are based on class interests. The party of order defends property and privilege, and the party of progress expresses and defends the interests of the underclasses -- urban workers and artisans. Theorists such as Nicos Poulantzas have used these texts as a basis for propounding theories of political consciousness and action and the \"relative autonomy\" of politics. The essays illustrate Marxist theories of politics.  But considered solely from the point of view of historiography and historical knowledge, the articles aren't particularly distinguished.Let's make an unfair but informative contrast: a comparison between Marx's writings and those of some of the great twentieth-century historians whom his ideas inspired. I'm thinking of scholars like Albert Soboul, Eric Hobsbawm, E. P. Thompson, Maurice Dobb, or Gene Genovese. Each of these scholars borrowed deeply from Marx's social theories -- class, power, consciousness, resistance, economic structure, property systems, labor. But each of these historians does something else as well: he digs deeply into the gnarly, special, and resistant reality of historical events and groups -- peasant movements, churches and manifestoes, parties and conspiracies, slave quarters. These historians try to discover the particular and peculiar graininess of history; they allow theory to rest lightly on their narratives.So what does Marx have to teach us about the craft of historical writing and reasoning? I'm inclined to say that Marx uses history but doesn't really write history. His writings are historically oriented, but they are almost never works of primary historical discovery and explanation.  Marx is a theorist of historical processes; but he is not really a working historian, and his writings don't really offer much by way of innovative historical reasoning. It remained for Marxist historians of the twentieth century to bring together Marx's theoretical insights with rigorous methods of historical research and discovery."}, {"title": "What holds a country together?", "date": "Monday, October 13, 2008", "text": "When you consider the enormous differences that exist across regions and traditions in the United States, it raises an interesting question: what factors serve to knit this population together into a single polity? We don't share a single set of cultural values, a single religion, or a single political tradition. So what helps this population of some 300 million achieve some degree of civic or national identity?One possible answer is a skeptical one: there is no such common strand of civic identity in the United States. Instead, we are a nation of overlapping identities and traditions, with the remarkable good fortune that these differences have only rarely developed into serious inter-group conflict. On this approach, the general history of harmony among groups and regions is only a happy accident.Another possible approach goes a bit further than this one, in noticing that in fact there is quite a bit of social dis-harmony in the history of the United States. Racism and the violent oppression of African-Americans and Latinos during various periods, the hostile reception offered to internal migrants during the Great Depression, the violence and hostility offered to gay and lesbian Americans at various junctures, and the harsh words Sarah Palin directs against Easterners all point in that direction. We might say that it is the generally effective reach of the state rather than a shared civic or national identity that usually maintains a large degree of inter-group peace in the United States.There is also, of course, the identity that derives from patriotism and the flag. This is a political psychology of nationalism, and it doesn't have much to do with reflective values. It is a constructed identity, aimed at making an identity group out of a mixed population. And if this is the best we can do, then the performances of patriotic songs and speeches are obvious mechanisms through which leaders attempt to instill the appropriate emotions. And the act of dissent may seem deeply disruptive, if this is all that holds us together.It may be that there are other mechanisms of political identity formation that work in the direction of forging a national identity. Film and television are candidates here, and large events of shared history may play a role too.  I particularly admire Lincoln's phrase, \"the mystic chords of memory.\"  But shared memories don't always create a shared identity -- for example, we can validly ask whether the remembered experience of the Vietnam War contributes more to identity or division.But here is another and more positive possibility. We might hope that the United States has painfully and haltingly created a shared civic culture that stands above the more visceral strands of religious, ethnic, or nationalistic identity. It is a moral value system that stands deliberately above more specific value commitments that derive from our particular philosophies or traditions.  This culture is the value system of liberal democracy. It valorizes the idea of the equal worth of all persons; the moral importance of mutual respect; the idea that everyone has the same rights to freedom of action and legal protection; the recognition that disagreements about values and policies are normal parts of a democracy; and the conviction that this system of equal citizenship and dignity is a morally worthwhile achievement in American history and politics.This approach says that we do have the makings of a civic identity. But how does this approach avoid amounting to an amalgam of bromides from high school civics courses or the political theories of Locke and Rousseau?It avoids this unhappy fate by being so hard. This political identity of equality, respect, and liberty has to be constructed rather than assumed. This requires the best efforts of leaders and citizens.  And it runs into conflict with some very powerful currents in American culture -- xenophobia, racism, mistrust, and the politics of division, for example. Some of our national leaders have been articulate in nurturing these values -- Johnson amd Clinton, for example.  Others have chosen a language of division -- Richard Nixon comes to mind (\"the silent majority\") along with Spiro Agnew and his \"nattering nabobs of negativism\".  Unity around the values of justice, equality, and democracy is more difficult to achieve than division across group identities and interests. But it is a much more admirable basis for a human polity, and a better guide for a pluralistic America."}, {"title": "Policy, treatment, and mechanism", "date": "Saturday, October 11, 2008", "text": "Policies are selected in order to bring about some desired social outcome or to prevent an undesired one. Medical treatments are applied in order to cure a disease or to ameliorate its effects. In each case an intervention is performed in the belief that this intervention will causally interact with a larger system in such a way as to bring about the desired state. On the basis of a body of beliefs and theories, we judge that T in circumstances C will bring about O with some degree of likelihood. If we did not have such a belief, then there would be no rational basis for choosing to apply the treatment. \"Try something, try anything\" isn't exactly a rational basis for policy choice.In other words, policies and treatments depend on the availability of bodies of knowledge about the causal structure of the domain we're interested in -- what sorts of factors cause or inhibit what sorts of outcomes. This means we need to have some knowledge of the mechanisms that are at work in this domain. And it also means that we need to have some degree of ability to predict some future states -- \"If you give the patient an aspirin her fever will come down\" or \"If we inject $700 billion into the financial system the stock market will recover.\"Predictions of this sort could be grounded in two different sorts of reasoning. They might be purely inductive: \"Clinical studies demonstrate that administration of an aspirin has a 90% probability of reducing fever.\" Or they could be based on hypotheses about the mechanisms that are operative: \"Fever is caused by C; aspirin reduces C in the bloodstream; therefore we should expect that aspirin reduces fever by reducing C.\" And ideally we would hope that both forms of reasoning are available -- causal expectations are born out by clinical evidence.Implicitly this story assumes that the relevant causal systems are pretty simple -- that there are only a few causal pathways and that it is possible to isolate them through experimental studies.  We can then insert our proposed interventions into the causal diagram and have reasonable confidence that we can anticipate their effects. The logic of clinical trials as a way of establishing efficacy depends on this assumption of causal simplicity and isolation.But what if the domain we're concerned with isn't like that? Suppose instead that there are many causal factors and a high degree of causal interdependence among the factors. And suppose that we have only limited knowledge of the strength and form of these interdependencies. Is it possible to make rationally justified interventions within such a system? This description comes pretty close to what are referred to as complex systems. And the most basic finding in the study of complex systems is the extreme difficulty of anticipating future system states. Small interventions or variations in boundary conditions produce massive variations in later system states. But this is bad news for policy makers who are hoping to \"steer\" a complex system towards a more desirable state. There are good analytical reasons for thinking that they will not be able to anticipate the nature or magnitude or even direction of the effects of the intervention.The study of complex systems is a collection of areas of research in mathematics, economics, and biology that attempt to arrive at better ways of modeling and projecting the behavior of systems with these complex causal interdependencies. This is an exciting field of research at places like the Santa Fe Institute and the University of Michigan. One important tool that had been extensively developed is the theory of agent-based modeling -- essentially, the effort to derive system properties as the aggregate result of the activities of independent agents at the micro-level. And a fairly durable result has emerged: run a model of a complex system a thousand times and you will get a wide distribution of outcomes. This means that we need to think of complex systems as being highly contingent and path-dependent in their behavior.  The effect of an intervention may be a wide distribution of future states.So far the argument is located at a pretty high level of abstraction. Simple causal systems admit of intelligent policy intervention, whereas complex, chaotic systems may not. But the important question is more concrete: which kind of system are we facing when we consider social policy or disease? Are social systems and diseases examples of complex systems? Can social systems be sufficiently disaggregated into fairly durable subsystems that admit of discrete causal analysis and intelligent intervention? What about diseases such as solid tumors? Can we have confidence in interventions such as chemotherapy? And, in both realms, can the findings of complexity theory be helpful by providing mathematical means for working out the system effects of various possible  interventions?"}, {"title": "What to do?", "date": "Tuesday, October 7, 2008", "text": "Decision makers at every level are perplexed by the turbulence created by the current financial crisis. Everyone is acting under great uncertainty -- business owners, state governors, the Department of the Treasury, the presidential candidates, and university officials. And yet today's actions may have enormous effects on the business, the non-profit organization, the family, or the state tomorrow.  Liquidity drought, variations in cash flow, the availability of credit for major capital projects, the possibility of bankruptcy of major and essential business partners such as contractors, the possibility of further major job losses in various regions, abrupt decline in demand for houses and cars, and a plummeting stock market make for an environment of choice in which every action can have seriously bad consequences.I'm thinking here particularly of decision makers who are responsible for large, complex organizations -- organizations that deliver services or products, that depend on staff and facilities to fulfill their mission, that need to make medium-term plans about investments of resources for future use, and that depend on assumptions about revenues in the future to satisfy the cash-flow needs of the enterprise to stay financially viable.  What is noteworthy about this situation of choice is that it necessarily involves plans and projections about the future.  And it involves the temporally extended coordination of activities of people and expenditures of resources over a prolonged period of time.  This means that it isn't possible to achieve success through a purely opportunistic and moment-by-moment response to events.  You can't fly a complex organization by the seat of your pants.So how do we plan for the best outcomes in the current circumstances of turbulence and uncertainty?  The normal assumption of continuity -- assume that most circumstances won't change much between today and tomorrow -- is distinctly inappropriate. Today's economic and financial environment has many moving parts -- and they interact in surprising ways. And unfortunately, it appears that there is no reliable science to guide us here. Experts disagree about the mechanisms and the potential remedies of the current crisis. Navigating this environment is akin to trying to catch a pingpong ball in a crowded wind tunnel.So what is to be done? I mean to pose this question in the most pragmatic way possible. Given deep uncertainty about the changes that may occur tomorrow, and given a fairly deep ignorance of the fundamental mechanisms that are affecting this storm, how can prudent stewards of institutions and businesses do the best job possible to preserve the fundamental interests of their stakeholders and carry out the missions of their organizations?There are a couple of rational-choice answers to this question, falling generally under the topic of \"decision making under risk and uncertainty.\" One prescription is the expected utility rule: identify the possible actions and their various outcomes; assign a probability and utility to each outcome; and choose the action with the greatest expected utility (sum of the products of probability and utility for the outcomes). Or we might consider the more risk-averse rule, the minimax principle: choose that action with the least bad worst possible outcome.Unfortunately, neither of these decision procedures is of much help in current circumstances. We don't know what the range of possible outcomes is for a given action or policy (because we don't understand the mechanisms); we can't assign likelihoods to outcomes; and it's not feasible to measure the utility of a given outcome, all things considered.  So expected utility decision-making doesn't seem very helpful in current circumstances.Another approach depends on what we might call \"locally rational decision-making\" or heuristic decision-making. We don't know what the consequences of an extended liquidity crisis are, but we may reason that more reserves are always useful; so we may choose to curtail spending today to increase reserves. Or we may observe that an additional debt burden for the business is likely to be a handicap in the future, so we may postpone important capital projects.  Or we may defer hiring additional staff in order to preserve more budget flexibility in the future.  But notice that there are rules of thumb that point in the opposite direction: \"A business should take bold moves in times of crisis, to leave it in a stronger position when recovery begins.\" This advice would encourage investment rather than curtailing it. So the problem with rules of thumb is that they often come into conflict with each other -- leaving the decision maker in a quandary.In fact, if the range of uncertainty is great enough, it is impossible to be prudent. Prudence involves taking steps today that are most likely to leave you in a satisfactory position tomorrow. But if we are uncertain about even the most basic truisms -- if we are in a position where the most basic assumptions of continuity are defeated -- then we can't begin to weigh possible outcomes or design prudent strategies.  It's hard to see how a pilot could fly \"prudently\" in the dark and without instruments.It would seem that today's financial crisis doesn't create quite this degree of radical uncertainty, however. It is a fair bet that the world economy and financial system will survive and will recover within a few years. It is likely enough that cash reserves will be very useful for organizations and businesses in the next few years.  It is likely that risky decisions have a greater potential for enterprise ruin than in normal times -- \"high risk, high reward\" is probably a bad rule to follow in current circumstances. And these assumptions add up to a counsel of conservation of resources, flexibility of activities, cost discipline, and preservation of accessible reserves."}, {"title": "Strange parallels", "date": "Sunday, October 5, 2008", "text": "Victor Lieberman uses the phrase, \"strange parallels,\" as the title for his two-volume study of Southeast Asian history (Strange Parallels: Volume 1, Integration on the Mainland: Southeast Asia in Global Context, c. 800-1830). Besides offering a highly expert history of Burma and its many kingdoms between 800 and 1830, Lieberman poses a fascinating and novel question: how can we explain the substantial historical parallels that existed between Burma and various parts of Europe, including especially France and Russia?  He writes:In fact, in mainland Southeast Asia as well as in France, the late 18th and early 19th centuries ended the third and inaugurated the last of four roughly synchronized cycles of political consolidation that together spanned the better part of a millenium. (2)fig. 1.2. Territorial consolidation (p. 4)The figure illustrates the kind of synchrony that Lieberman is highlighting -- over a sweep of some thousand years, there is a rough-and-ready correspondence in the patterns of territorial consolidation that existed in Burma and France.Lieberman poses the crucial historical question in these terms: \"Why should distant regions, with no obvious religious or material links, have experienced more or less coordinated cycles? If we discount coincidence, what hitherto invisible ties could have spanned the continents?\" (2)Apriori there appear to be only a small number of logically distinct possibilities that could explain the fact that patterns of variation are synchronized between A and B. (1) It may be that there is a causal linkage from A to B such that A's variations stimulate subsequent variations in B.  (2) It may be that there is a common cause C whose variation simultaneously causes variation in both A and B. Global climate variation might be such an example. (3) It may be that both A and B are running through their variations according to the same internal clock, with the result that their variations are synchronized without causal interaction -- like two clocks ringing out the hours in tandem or two adolescent children going through roughly the same developmental stages at roughly the same time. (4) It may be that the observed synchrony is simple coincidence, with no causal explanation whatsoever.So far as I can see, this exhausts the logical possibilities; there is no fifth possibility.To further complicate the picture, Lieberman points out that there were other regions of the world where these patterns of consolidation did not occur, or did so on a very different timeline. So we can exclude the idea that there was some common global cause leading to simultaneous pulses of consolidation; rather, Southeast Asia and Western Europe were synchronized, but India was not.Lieberman's explanation of this observed historical synchrony goes along these lines.  He believes that both internalist and externalist approaches have a role to play.  The internal historical dynamics of the state systems in Burma and Western Europe were governed by particular local factors.  But they each created a tendency towards consolidation of land and power.  And external factors provided periodic \"pulses\" that served to synchronize these internal patterns of development.  So the effects of an external factor -- maritime trade -- pushed both Western Europe and Burma into extended periods of state formation and consolidation. This story combines (3) and (2) above: local processes that are developing according to their own imperatives, and occasional system-wide pulses that bring these local processes into synchrony.  And the explanation allows Lieberman to place the intellectual frameworks of both Tilly and Wallerstein into the story.Lieberman's approach is important for the philosophy of history because it leads us to ask different questions about historical causation and historical time. And it provides important new thinking about how to approach the nexus between regional history and global history."}, {"title": "System tendencies?", "date": "Thursday, October 2, 2008", "text": "A central theme of many of the posts here is the contingency, heterogeneity, and path dependency of social processes.  I used the metaphor of a \"constrained random walk\" in an earlier posting to characterize many social processes.  This figure is intended to stand in contrast to the idea of an inevitable development towards an optimum or equilibrium point, on the one hand, or the idea of an inevitable system failure, on the other.The idea here is this: from starting point A, there are numerous possible states of affairs Oi that might be reached over an extended period of time. There is no sense in which the course from A to the actual historical outcome Om is inevitable or unique.  (From the starting point of Europe in 1910, including the social, political, and economic realities of the nations of Europe, multiple outcomes were accessible by the time of 1920: exhausting war, emergence of new and effective international organizations that sustained the peace, inspired just-in-time diplomacy bringing hostilities to an early termination, ...).  Each of the pathways leading from A to Oi might be individually explicable, in terms of the situations of structure and agency that were present during the period of development.  Virtually every point in the \"space\" of outcomes would be accessible, although some outcomes might be substantially less likely than others.  Along the way there are likely to be cul-de-sacs; but in the aggregate, the space of possible outcomes from many historical starting points covers the full sphere of possibilities.  Putting the point crudely, you can get anywhere from anywhere.This conception emphasizes deep contingency in social change.  But what about the symmetrical facts of \"constraint\" and \"imperative\" -- the limitations imposed by existing institutions and organizations at any specific stage and the positive impulses to change that are often embodied in the incentive structures of existing institutions?  Is the contingency of social events to some extent reduced by the relative durability of existing core social institutions?  Is there such a thing as a \"logic of institutions\" that is embodied in a particular configuration of core social institutions, with the result that societies embodying these institutions will be most likely to develop in one way rather than another?This description lies at the heart of Marx's analysis of social systems as modes of production.  Marx believed that the core institutions that defined the property system, the system of labor control, and the distribution of wealth have deep effects on individual agency, leading and constraining agents to behave in ways that lead in the aggregate to certain kinds of social outcomes.  Modes of production have system tendencies that can be inferred from their basic institutional features.  A particularly clear example is his analysis of the \"law\" of the falling rate of profit within capitalism: firms are required to maximize profits; they have the opportunity of introducing capital-intensive technologies that lower costs, thereby increasing profits in the short run; competition with other profit-maximizing firms pushes prices down to the new cost of production; the rising capital-labor ratio in industry creates a falling rate of profit.  So capitalism embodies a system tendency towards a falling rate of profit over time.  Similar reasoning underlies Marx's prediction of financial crises within capitalism.  (See an earlier posting on Marx's conception of capitalism.)And in fact, if we could make two assumptions, then Marx's reasoning about the tendencies of capitalism would be very compelling: the assumption that the core economic institutions are fixed and unchanging, and the assumption that there are no other social-political-economic institutions in play that might serve as resources for policies and actions that would offset the predicted tendencies of capitalism.  However, neither of these assumptions is correct.  The institutions of any major social order -- feudalism, the Chinese agrarian economy, capitalism, state socialism -- are always the composite of a vast number of lower-level institutions; and these lower-level institutions are usually in a state of flux.  So the core institutions are not fixed and unchanging.  The traditional Chinese agrarian economy was remarkably resilient in face of a range of deep challenges over centuries; adjustment of basic social institutions permitted Chinese society to cope better with environmental and international circumstances than a modeled Chinese economy would have predicted.Second, even more fundamentally, a society is not simply a \"mode of production,\" constituted by an economic structure.  Rather, there are a range of other, equally fundamental institutions and practices -- cultural, political, legal, community-based and national -- through which resourceful agents attempt to solve personal or social problems at various points in time.  So the \"logic\" of the economic institutions is only one part of the overall social trajectory; instead, we have the strategic interaction and aggregation of political, cultural, social, demographic, and legal institutions that complement and offset the workings of the economic structure.  And further, we can correctly say that each of these aspects of social organization has its own \"system tendencies.\"  Elected legislatures have a logic that derives from the calculations of political self-interest of the legislators, community-based organizations have their own logic, various demographic regimes have their own tendencies (for example, the favoring of boy children produces skewed sex ratios that have negative political effects), and so forth.So the tentative conclusion that I draw from these various considerations is, once again, to give the nod to contingency while recognizing the partial imperatives created by the various sets of core institutions that are embodied in a society at a given time.  Structures do of course constrain agents.  But structures interact with each other, leading to surprising results.  And structures change in response to a variety of causes, including the strategic efforts of agents to modify them.  So the upshot is, once again, that we should expect a high degree of contingency in outcomes over extended periods of historical time.  Historical experience may well support the discovery that \"capitalism creates a tendency towards X\" or \"fascist politics create a tendency towards Y\".  To that extent, there are \"system tendencies\".  But it is rare for one particular sub-system (property relations, electoral system, demographic regime) to dominate the overall historical trajectory.  And so the system tendencies of one partial set of core institutions rarely become the system tendencies of the overall social whole."}, {"title": "Continuity", "date": "Tuesday, September 30, 2008", "text": "Throughout much of our social experience we expect continuity: tomorrow will be pretty similar to today, and when changes occur they will be small and gradual. We expect our basic institutions -- economic, social, and political -- to maintain their core characteristics over long periods of time. We expect social attitudes and values to change only slowly, through gradual evolution rather than abrupt transformation. And we expect the same of a range of social conditions -- for example, highway safety, crime rates, teen pregnancy rates, and similar social features.It is evident that this expectation of gradual, continuous change is not always a valid guide to events. Abrupt, unexpected events occur -- revolutions, mass cultural changes like the 1960s, sweeping political and legislative changes along the lines of the Reagan revolution.  And of course we have the current example of abrupt declines in financial markets -- see the graph of the Dow Jones Industrial Average for the week of September 23-30, 2008 below.  So the expectation of continuity sometimes leads us astray.   But continuity is probably among our most basic heuristic assumptions about the future when it comes to our expectations about the social world and our plans for the future.The deeper question is an ontological one: what features of social causation and processes would either support or undermine the expectation of continuity?  We can say quite a bit about the features of continuity and discontinuity in physical systems; famously, \"non-linearities\" occur in some physical systems that lead to singularities and discontinuities, but many physical systems are safely linear and continuous all the way down.  And these mathematical features follow from the fundamental physical mechanisms that underlie physical systems.  But what about the social world?Take first the stability of large social and political institutions. Is there a reason to expect that major social and political institutions will retain their core features in face of disturbing influences? Consider for example the SEC as a financial regulatory institution; the European Union as a multinational legislative body; or a large health maintenance organization.  Here institutional sociologists have provided a number of important insights.  First, institutions often change through the accumulation of a myriad of small adaptations in different locations within the institution.  This is a process that is likely to give rise to slow, continuous, gradual change for the institution as a whole; and this is continuous behavior.  Second, though, institutional sociologists have identified important internal forces that work actively to preserve the workings of the institution: the stakeholders who benefit from the current arrangements.  Stakeholders are given incentives to actively reinforce and preserve the current institutional arrangements -- the status quo.  Both of these factors suggest that institutional change will often be slow, gradual, and continuous.Consider next the ways in which attitudes and values change in a population.  Here it is plausible to observe that individuals change their attitudes and values slowly, through exposure to other individuals and behaviors.  And the attitudes and values of a new generation are usually transmitted through processes that are highly decentralized -- again suggesting a slow and gradual process of change.  So this suggests that changes in attitudes and values might behave analogously to the spread of a pathogen through a population -- with a slow and continuous spread of \"contagion\" resulting in a gradual change in population attitudes.Consider last the example of social measures such as crime rates or teen pregnancy rates.  If we take it as a premise that crime and teen pregnancy are influenced by social factors that in turn influence the behavior of individuals, and if we take it that these background social factors change slowly and continuously -- then it is credible to reason that the aggregate measures of the associated behaviors will change slowly and continuously as well.  The reasoning here is probabilistic: when large numbers of people with a specified set of background social psychologies are exposed to common environmental circumstances, then it is plausible to predict that the average rate of teen pregnancy will remain fairly steady if the background circumstances remain steady.These are all reasons for expecting a degree of stability and continuity in social arrangements and social behavior.  But before we conclude that the social world is a continuous place, consider this: We also have some pretty clear models of how social phenomena might occur in a dis-continuous fashion.  Critical mass phenomena, tipping points, and catastrophic failures are examples of groups of social phenomena where we should expect discontinuities.  The behavior of a disease in a population may change dramatically once a certain percentage of the population is infected (critical mass); a new slang expression (\"yada yada yada\") may abruptly change its frequency of useage once a certain number of celebrities have adopted it (tipping point); a civic organization may be stretched to the breaking point by the addition of new unruly members and may suddenly collapse or mutate. (The hypothesis of punctuated equilibrium brings this sort of discontinuity into Darwinian theory of evolution.)So there are some good foundational reasons for expecting a degree of continuity in the social environment; but there are also convincing models of social behavior that lead to important instances of discontinuous outcomes.  This all seems to lead to the slightly worrisome piece of advice: don't bet on the future when the stakes are high.  Stock markets collapse; unexpected wars occur; and previously harmonious social groups fall into fratricidal violence.  And there is no fool-proof way of determining whether a singularity is just around the corner."}, {"title": "Equilibrium reasoning", "date": "Monday, September 29, 2008", "text": "A system is in equilibrium with respect to a given characteristic when there is a system of forces in play that push the system back to the equilibrium state when it is subjected to small disturbances or changes. This is referred to as a homeostatic system.The temperature in a goldfish bowl is in equilibrium if the bowl is provided with a thermostatically controlled heater and cooler; when the external temperature falls and the water temperature begins to fall as well, the thermostat registers the change of temperature and turns on the heater, and when the external temperature rises, the thermostat turns on the cooler.  A population of squirrels in a bounded forest may reach an equilibrium size that is balanced by excess reproductive capacity (pushing the population upwards when it falls below the feeding capacity of the environment) and by excess mortality from poor nutrition (pushing the population downwards when it rises above the feeding capacity of the environment).These examples embody very different causal mechanisms; but each represents a case in which the variable in question (temperature or population size) oscillates around the equilibrium value determined by the features of the environment and the features of the adjustment mechanisms.There are other physical systems where the concept of equilibrium has no role.  The trajectory of a fly ball is not an equilibrium outcome, but rather the direct causal consequence of the collision between bat and ball. And if the course of the baseball is disturbed -- by impact with a passing bird or an updraft of wind -- then the terminus of the ball's flight will be different.   The number of telephone calls between Phoenix and Albany is not an equilibrium outcome, even if it is fairly stable over time, but simply the aggregate consequence of the contingent telephone behavior of large numbers of people in the two cities.  So systems that reach and maintain equilibrium are somewhat special.It is also interesting to observe that there are other circumstances that produce a stable steady state in a system besides equilibrium processes.  We may observe that elevators in a busy office building most frequently have 10 passengers.  And the explanation for this may go along these lines:  10 is the maximum number of adults who can be squeezed into the elevator car; there are always many people waiting for an elevator; so virtually every car is at full capacity of 10 persons.  This is an example of a pattern that derives from a population of events that demands full utilization, and a limit condition in the location where activity takes place.  In this example, 10 passengers is not an equilibrium outcome but rather a forced outcome deriving from excess demand and a logistical constraint on the volume of activity.  A large city may show a population history that indicates a trend of population increase from 4 million to 6 million to 10 million -- and then it stops growing.  And the explanation of the eventual stable population size of 10 million may depend on the fact that the water supplies available to the city cannot support a population significantly larger than 10 million.To what extent are social ensembles and processes involved in equilibrium conditions?  The paradigm example of equilibrium reasoning in the social sciences arises in microeconomic theory.  Supply and demand curves are postulated as being fixed, and the price of a good is the equilibrium position where the quantity produced at this price is equal to the quantity consumed at this price.  If the price rises, demand for the good falls and the price falls; if the price falls below the equilibrium position, producers manufacture less of the good and consumers demand more of it, which induces a price rise.Another important example of equilibrium analysis in social behavior is the application of central place theory to economic geography.  The theory is that places (cities, towns, villages) will be positioned across the countryside in a way that embodies a set of urban hierarchies and a set of commercial pathways.  The topology of the system and the size of the nodes are postulated to be controlled by social variables such as transport cost and demand density.  And individuals' habitation decisions are influenced in a way that reinforces the topology and size hierarchy of the central place system.However, even in these simple examples there are circumstances that can make the equilibrium condition difficult to attain. If the supply and demand curves shift periodically, then the equilibrium price itself moves around. If the price and production response characteristics are too large in their effects, then the system may keep bouncing around the equilibrium price, from \"too high\" to \"too low\" without the capacity of finetuning production and consumption. The resulting behavior would look like a graph of the stock market rather than a stable, regular system returning to its \"equilibrium\" value.  And, in the case of habitation patterns, some places may gain a reputation for fun that offsets their disadvantages from the point of view of transport and demand density -- thereby disrupting the expected equilibrium outcomes.So if the conditions defining the terms of an equilibrium change too quickly, or if the feedback mechanisms that work to adjust the system value to current equilibrium conditions are too coarse, then we should not expect the system to arrive at an equilibrium state.  (The marble rolling on a rotating dinner plate will continue to roll across all parts of the plate rather than arriving at the lowest point on the plate and staying there.)I'm inclined to think that equilibria are relatively rare in the social world.  The reasons for this are several: it is uncommon to be able to discover homeostatic mechanisms that adjust social variables; when quasi-homeostatic mechanisms exist, they are often too coarse to lead to equilibrium; and, most fundamentally, the constraints that constitute the boundary conditions for idealized equilibria among social variables are often themselves changing too rapidly to permit an equilibrium to emerge.  Instead, social outcomes more often look like constrained random walks, in which social actions occur in a fairly uncoordinated way at the individual level and aggregate to singular social outcomes that are highly path-dependent and contingent. Social outcomes are more often stochastic than being guided by homeostatic mechanisms."}, {"title": "Turning points", "date": "Sunday, September 28, 2008", "text": "Are there turning points in history? How would we know if we're in the midst of one?  Does the current financial crisis represent a turning point in the development of the US economy?  Did the election of Ronald Reagan represent a turning point in American politics and government?Often what is announced as a turning point eventually seems like a change without a difference --  an example of rearranging the deck chairs on the Titanic, of changing drivers but not direction. Nguyen van Thieu takes office in Vietnam in 1967 and a new era is announced; but then the same old policies persist and Vietnam slides ever further towards Communist victory.A turning point might be defined as an event, action, or choice, that profoundly alters the direction of a whole series of subsequent events. The New Deal is perhaps a candidate in the development of the political-social culture of the United States -- a new set of policies, laws, and strategies that set the United States on a new direction and that substantially constrained later choices by government. The notion of a turning point conveys the situation of contingency -- up until T things might have continued within the existing pattern P, but after T things shifted to P'. And it conveys the idea of path dependency as well -- now that the turning point has occurred and P' is embodied, it is much more difficult to return to P. So a turning point results from some contingent event that occurs within a system at a particular time and substantially inflects the future dynamics of development of the system. The idea turns on the background assumption that there are mechanisms or forces that sustain the development of the system, and that contingent events can \"push\" the system onto a different course for a while.What sorts of things can have turning points? Can an individual have one? What about a family or a marriage?  How about a business or a university? And how about a nation or a civilization? We might say that anything that has a recognizable and somewhat stable pattern of development can display a turning point. So each of these orders of human affairs can do so. An individual may be influenced by a traumatic event or a charismatic person and may change his ways; from that point forward he may behave differently -- more honestly, more cautiously, more compassionately. The event was a turning point on his development. A \"velvet revolution\" may be on a course that gives great importance to non-violent tactics. Then something happens -- a violent repression by the state, the emergence of a new clique of leaders more open to violence. The velvet revolution undergoes a turning point and becomes more violent in its strategies.Schematically, the idea of a turning point involves an ontology something like this: system properties in a state of persistence > singular event > new system properties in a state of persistence.So how could we know that we're at a turning point? The answer seems to be: we can't. Only the larger course of history can indicate whether contemporary changes will be large and persistent, or cosmetic and evanescent.The idea of a \"turning point\" is perhaps one of the analytical categories that we use to characterize and analyze the sweep of history.  It is a narrative device that highlights persistence, contingency, and direction.  And, it would appear, we've got to wait until the Owl of Minerva spreads its wings before we can say with confidence when they occur."}, {"title": "What social science can do", "date": "Monday, September 22, 2008", "text": "Quite a few postings here emphasize the limits of social science knowledge. Prediction of the behavior of large social wholes is difficult to impossible. There are few strong regularities among social phenomena. Social entities and processes are heterogeneous, plastic, and path-dependent. So the question arises: what can the social sciences do that takes them beyond the realm of description and reportage of the blooming, buzzing confusion of social comings and goings, to something that is more explanatory and generalizable?I think there is an answer to this, and it has to do with identifying mid-level mechanisms and processes that recur in roughly similar ways in a range of different social settings. The social sciences can identify a fairly large number of these sorts of recurring mechanisms.  For example --public goods problems political entrepreneurship principal-agent problems features of ethnic or religious group mobilization market mechanisms and failures rent-seeking behavior the social psychology associated with small groups the moral emotions of family and kinshipthe dynamics of a transport network the communications characteristics of medium-size social networks the psychology and circumstances of solidarity Further, the social sciences can attempt to discover the circumstances at the level of individual agents that make these mechanisms robust across social settings. They can model the dynamics and features of aggregation that they possess. And they can attempt to discover the workings of such mechanisms in particular social and historical settings, and work towards explanations of particular features of these events based on their theories of the properties of the mechanisms. Finally, they can attempt to find rigorous ways of attempting to model the effects of aggregating multiple mechanisms in a particular setting.What this comes down to is the view that the main theoretical and generalizing contribution that the social sciences can make is the discovery and analysis of a wise range of recurring social mechanisms grounded in features of human agency and common institutional and material settings.  They can help to constitute a rich tool box for social explanation. And, in a weak and fallible way, they can lay the basis for some limited social generalizations -- for example, \"In circumstances where a group of independent individuals make private decisions about their actions, the public goods shared by the group will be under-provided.\"This approach affords a degree of explanatory capacity and generalization to the social sciences. What it does not underwrite is the ability to offer general, comprehensive theories about any complex kind of phenomenon -- cities, schools, revolutions. And it does not provide a foundation for confidence about large predictions about the future behavior of complex social wholes."}, {"title": "Social surprises", "date": "Sunday, September 21, 2008", "text": "The near meltdown of the US financial system this week came as a surprise to most of us -- experts, legislators, and citizens alike. That isn't to say that the components of the disaster were unknown -- the subprime crisis, the earlier financial undoings of Fannie Mae and Bear Stearns this summer, and the sudden collapse of Lehman Brothers last week. But what has come as a surprise is the severity of the warnings by the Federal Reserve and Treasury that the entire financial system is only a few steps from seizure and collapse. This is a catastrophic system failure -- and no one would have anticipated its possibility six months ago.Think of a few other surprises in the past thirty years -- the collapse of the Soviet Union, the Iranian Revolution, or the emergence of China as a roaring engine of market-based growth. In each case the event was a discontinuous break from the trajectory of the past, and it surprised experts and citizens alike.  (The photo above depicts the surprising Yeltsin standing on a tank in 1991.)So what is a surprise?  It is an event that shouldn't have happened, given our best understanding of how things work.  It is an event that deviates widely from our most informed expectations, given our best beliefs about the causal environment in which it takes place.  A surprise is a deviation between our expectations about the world's behavior, and the events that actually take place.  Many of our expectations are based on the idea of continuity: tomorrow will be pretty similar to today; a delta change in the background will create at most an epsilon change in the outcome.  A surprise is a circumstance that appears to represent a discontinuity in a historical series.It would be a major surprise if the sun suddenly stopped shining, because we understand the physics of fusion that sustains the sun's energy production.  It would be a major surprise to discover a population of animals in which acquired traits are passed across generations, given our understanding of the mechanisms of evolution.  And it would be a major surprise if a presidential election were decided by a unanimous vote for one candidate, given our understanding of how the voting process works.  The natural world doesn't present us with a large number of surprises; but history and social life are full of them.The occurrence of major surprises in history and social life is an important reminder that our understanding of the complex processes that are underway in the social world is radically incomplete and inexact. We cannot fully anticipate the behavior of the subsystems that we study -- financial systems, political regimes, ensembles of collective behavior -- and we especially cannot fully anticipate the interactions that arise when processes and systems intersect. Often we cannot even offer reliable approximations of what the effects are likely to be of a given intervention.  This has a major implication: we need to be very modest in the predictions we make about the social world, and we need to be cautious about the efforts at social engineering that we engage in. The likelihood of unforeseen and uncalculated consequences is great.And in fact commentators are now raising exactly these concerns about the 700 billion dollar rescue plan currently being designed by the Bush administration to save the financial system. \"Will it work?\" is the headline; \"What unforeseen consequences will it produce?\" is the subtext; and \"Who will benefit?\" is the natural followup question.It is difficult to reconcile this caution about the limits of our rational expectations about the future based on social science knowledge, with the need for action and policy change in times of crisis.  If we cannot rely on our expectations about what effects an intervention is likely to have, then we can't have confidence in the actions and policies that we choose.  And yet we must act; if war is looming, if famine is breaking out, if the banking system is teetering, a government needs to adopt policies that are well designed to minimize the bad consequences.  It is necessary to make decisions about action that are based on incomplete information and insufficient theory.  So it is a major challenge for the theory of public policy, to attempt to incorporate the limits of knowledge about consequences into the design of a policy process.  One approach that might be taken is the model of designing for \"soft landings\" -- designing strategies that are likely to do the least harm if they function differently than expected.  Another is to emulate a strategy that safety engineers employ when designing complex, dangerous systems: to attempt to de-link the subsystems to the extent possible, in order to minimize the likelihood of unforeseeable interactions.  (Nancy Leveson describes some of these strategies in Safeware: System Safety and Computers.) And there are probably other heuristics that could be imagined as well."}, {"title": "Power as influence", "date": "Wednesday, September 17, 2008", "text": "We've looked at power as the socially embodied ability of some people to compel the behavior of other people.  But this isn't the whole of what we would want to include within the scope of the uses of power.  Other important aspects of power are more impersonal, having to do with influencing outcomes rather than controlling behavior.  Powerful agents have the ability to set the agenda; to influence the rules of the game (whatever game one is involved in, including the state); to influence the flow of resources; and to make decisions that will have important consequences for other people.Consider a few examples.A large employer is concerned about rising health care costs. The compensation team lays out several choices: eliminate higher-cost insurance plans; eliminate subsidy for dependents; or shift more costs to employees through a higher premium copay formula. The CEO has the ability to choose one option over others; he/she exercises this authority in favor of option 3.  This is an exercise of power. The vice president of the United States wants to see a reduction in the rate of the capital gains tax. He quietly lobbies with legislators to incorporate this provision into upcoming tax legislation. He prevails. This too is an exercise of power -- an ability to bend outcomes to the VP's will. And it proceeds through the ability to influence other decision-makers. The mayor of a small city is in a position to influence which development projects will be permitted. He/she exercises this power to give the nod to A and to deny B. A receives a substantial business benefit and B is left out. A faculty reappointment committee considers the case of Assistant Professor X. It considers his/her dossier of research and teaching in relation to the standards. The case is not clear-cut. The committee has the power to end X's career at the university. It chooses not to support reappointment. It thereby exercises its power with respect to X's continuing employment. It emerges that one member had an animus against X and spoke persuasively against X. This member used a private form of power and influence against X and in furtherance of his own wishes. These examples illustrate much of what C. Wright Mills hoped to capture in his theory of the \"power elite\" -- a relatively compact group of people who are in a position to shape social outcomes to their liking by influencing the agenda, the rules, or the decisions (The Power Elite).And it goes with this social empowerment of small groups, that the possibilities of self-serving and self-interest arise. When individuals are in a position to determine the way social outcomes will occur, we have to consider the likelihood that they will have favored outcomes that serve their own interests best. So power in this circumstance has a lot to do with distributive outcomes -- who wins and who loses. And it had a lot to do with setting the rules of the game in ways that favor some people and disfavor others.These aspects of power are tremendously important in a complex society. People in positions to influence important decisions -- private, corporate, or governmental -- have a greatly amplified ability to shape outcomes to their own will. And this in turn permits elites to shape the social environment in ways that best serve their private interests.  (Stephen Lukes's book, Power: A Radical View, is particularly useful.)And this in turn makes the strongest possible case for democratic transparency. We want the decisions that affect us to be made fairly, with full consideration of the impact they have on everyone affected by them.  The decisions that influence everyone's well-being need to be made within a culture of openness and transparency. But all too often, this expectation is frustrated."}, {"title": "Non-coercive power?", "date": "Monday, September 15, 2008", "text": "The most visible exercise of power involves the direct use of force or the threat of violence. Demonstrators are cleared from the streets by police with truncheons and water cannons. Storekeepers are compelled to pay protection money by the example of a few mysterious fires.  But are there also instruments and tactics of power that do not ultimately depend on force?Recall a familiar definition of power. A wields power over B if A can bring it about that B behaves in such-and-so a way against B's will, desire, or choice. There are several mechanisms we might consider that involve the imposition of another's will without recourse to the threat of violence.Consider beach-front property owners who prefer that the public should not stroll on their bits of beach. If the property owners have the political clout needed to install \"residents-only\" gates on all the points of access, then they have succeeded in controlling the behavior of the strolling public -- without having to hire a private security company to threaten the public with violence if they trespass. They have used power and influence to block certain kinds of behavior. But of course the enforcement of law brings with it the threat of force -- so the private power identified here is actually effective only because it can leverage the coercive power of the state.So here's another strategy the private group might consider: deception. They might suborn the publishers of the local maps, disguising the points of access to the beach. Public picnic-seekers set off for an afternoon at the beach, only to fall into confusion because of the misleading maps. The private property owners have used their power to alter behavior -- without the trouble of threat of force. (And it is in fact difficult to find some if the exclusive resort communities that have cropped up in the American west!)And how about this: a well-financed program of disinformation designed to bring the public to believe that the beaches are unsafe, unhealthy, or uncool. The public loses its taste for beaches -- and the property owners once again get their way. No random strollers on the beach.  They've exercised power non-violently, by shifting the beliefs and wants of the public. Here the media can be an instrument of power.And we might imagine, finally, that the property owners exercise their will by \"log-rolling\" with the community groups who are interested in gaining access to the beachfront -- \"our support for your issues X, Y, Z is contingent upon your dropping this issue. You may prevail on this issue, but then you'll lose on X, Y, and Z.\"  The tradeoff is severe, and the property holders prevail.We might refer to these strategies of power generically as \"manipulating institutional outcomes,\" \"manipulating knowledge and belief,\" and \"manipulating preferences and desires.\"Where does Marx's quip that \"religion is the opiate of the people\" come into this analysis? It's relevant in several ways. First, it has to do with preferences. If a religious system leads a group to favor its spiritual redemption over its material improvement, its behavior will change. But it is also relevant to something not yet mentioned: the strength of motivation an individual or groups have to bring about the changes they favor. Strategies that blunt the effective motivation of a group to carry out its purposes are themselves an important avenue of power. And this is suggested by the \"opiate\" part of the statement, suggesting as it does the image of torpor. So when religion functions as an opiate, it serves to reduce the motivation for action by the group; it is demobilizing.These examples suggest that elites can effect their will through a variety of means that do not depend upon threat of violence, but that nonetheless work effectively to constrain the actions of other groups."}, {"title": "Innovation in social research", "date": "Saturday, September 13, 2008", "text": "The social sciences are charged to arrive at a good empirical understanding of the social world around us. They are charged to provide hypotheses and theories on the basis of which to explain the outcomes and patterns they discover. And they are charged to help design policies and interventions that will contribute to durable solutions to important social problems.This is a big agenda, and it will only be achieved, I believe, if the next several decades witness a substantial burst of creative new thinking in all the social sciences. The disciplines, the inter-disciplines, and the social science institutions need to stimulate a lot of innovative thinking, if we are to arrive at a better understanding of the social world and a better ability to solve social problems.Why should we think this is true? What makes us think that the current theories and research methodologies are not sufficient? And what kinds of innovation should we be aiming at?The need for innovation results from several points. First is the tendency of the social science disciplines to give excessive primacy to a few methodologies and theories as the preferred wisdom. Quantitative methods, survey methodology, rational choice theory, and formal modeling techniques have defined \"cutting-edge\" social science research for several decades in several disciplines. When we take full measure of their specific limitations, these are perfectly useful components of social science research. But we should never imagine that they suffice for every research problem. The problems confronting the social sciences need a broader palette, a larger tool box.Second, social phenomena almost always involve a mix of processes and behaviors that fall within the boundaries of distinct disciplines. This means that the hypotheses and theories of a single discipline will not capture the dynamics of the given body of phenomena. This in turn means that it is essential for social scientists to approach research problems with an interdisciplinary spirit; they need to welcome a somewhat eclectic mix of approaches.Third, there is a need for some new thinking about causal processes and the reasoning we use to investigate causation in the social realm. The turn to causal mechanisms is an important step in this direction, but more new thinking is needed as well.Fourth, it is important to find better ways of incorporating the study of agency and concrete individual behavior into social science theories. The cultural turn and the willingness to attempt to make use of some of the tools of ethnography and social psychology within structural and quantitative approaches is a good start, and we need to go further.Fifth, we need some new ideas about how separate social processes aggregate and interact. The basic idea of a social agglomeration as a composition of lesser processes seems very compelling; so a better set of tools for modeling and analyzing these compositional processes is needed.Much of this has to do with a particular kind of innovation: finding ways of borrowing across disciplines to permit the construction of analyses that are more sufficient. But there is also a need for a more fundamental form of innovation as well, at the level of the concepts and theories we use to characterize the social world. Could we arrive at a new concept of social identity that captures more of the fluidity and variability of the ways social identities actually work in a complex social world? Could our concept of social class be replaced by a different construct that was more friendly to the many strands that are involved in the phenomena of social class? Could we arrive at a better conceptual scheme for analyzing the institutions of government power and the exercise of state power?Here is a short list of innovative social theorists whom I would recognize in the past several decades: Albert Hirschman, Ben Anderson, James Scott, Charles Sabel, Seyla Ben-Habib, Martha Nussbaum, Thomas Schelling, Edward Said, Charles Tilly, Pierre Bourdieu, G. William Skinner, Elizabeth Perry, Robert Bates, Stephen Greenblatt, Robert Brenner, Mark Elvin. Each brought forward some genuinely novel ideas that shed new light on some aspect of the social world. And in many instances those ideas have demonstrated their staying-power. And, with almost no exceptions, none of these thinkers is narrowly defined by a single discipline."}, {"title": "What is social scientific knowledge?", "date": "Wednesday, September 10, 2008", "text": "The social and behavioral sciences endeavor to describe, explain, and interpret the range of the social and behavioral facts that surround us.  To refer to this body of findings as \u201cscience\u201d is to claim a set of epistemic values about the nature of the methods of inquiry and evaluation that are used to arrive at and assess the conclusions offered about this domain.  The label \u201cscience\u201d brings with it a set of presuppositions about rigor, evidence, generalizability, logical analysis, objectivity, cumulativeness, and the likelihood that the assertions that are made are true.Consider a few assumptions that are often made about scientific knowledge\u2014some valid and some not.  Science is based on a set of rationally justified methods of inquiry and testing.  Scientific knowledge progresses, in scope, in detail of understanding, and in reliability.  Science is performed by specialists, working within equally exacting communities of peers and competitors and subject to a demanding set of standards of evaluation\u2014peer-reviewed journals, university review processes, national laboratories, and international associations and conferences.  The result of these processes of testing and evaluation, we expect, is an expanding body of hypotheses, experimental findings, observations, theories, and explanations that have substantial credibility\u2014and substantially higher credibility than the writings of casual observers of a given range of phenomena.  We come to know the nature of the world better through the institutions and methods of science.In addition to these reasonably valid assumptions about scientific knowledge, there is another group of more questionable ideas that derive from assumptions drawn from the natural sciences.  Science permits generalizations; it permits us to systematize otherwise apparently separate domains of phenomena (planetary motion, the tides; rational choice theory, behavior of the family) and to demonstrate that apparently heterogeneous sets of phenomena are in fact governed by the same general laws.  Science permits predictions; if the fundamentals are thus-and-so, then the compounds will behave thusly.  Science aims at unification: the discovery of unitary systems of forces and entities whose aggregate properties represent the whole of nature.Notice that these latter expectations are derived from the successes and specific characteristics of certain of the natural sciences.  And this marks the first of many opportunities for error in the philosophy of social science.  There is no reason to expect that the social domain possesses the underlying nature and orderliness that would make it possible to achieve some of these characteristics (in particular, uniformity, generalizability, unification, simplicity). Consider some other areas of possible empirical research\u2014for example, animal behavior.  We should not expect there to be comprehensive theories of animal behavior.  Instead, we should expect many threads of research, corresponding to many dimensions of animal behavior: cognition, memory, instinct, social behaviors, migratory behavior.  And these many strands of research would reach out to different kinds of causal backgrounds: evolutionary biology, neurophysiology, intra-group learning.  Likewise with the domain of social behavior.  There is no single unified \u201ctheory of human motivation\u201d\u2014whether rational choice theory, social psychology, or any other unified theory.  And this is so, because there is no unified reality of motivation and action; rather, there is a heterogeneous range of motives, errors, impulses, commitments, and habits that together constitute \u201cdispositions to behave.\u201dWhat underwrites the claim of truthfulness for scientific knowledge?  What gives us a rational basis for believing that the results of the socially constructed activities of science lead to true hypotheses about the nature and workings of the phenomena that scientific inquiry considers?  There is, first, the basic argument of empiricism: we can observe some features of the world and establish certain statements as being probable.  And we can use a collection of tools of inference to establish credibility of other non-observational statements (deductive and inductive logic, statistics, the experimental method, causal modeling).This simple empiricist epistemology underwrites the strongest claims for veridicality and justification for the social sciences.  The discovery of empirical facts about the social world is possible but challenging; this is what much of social science methodology attempts to under-gird.  And hypotheses about the causal relationships that exist among social entities and processes can be tested using a variety of methods of inference that themselves possess strong epistemic justification.  We have learned from the writings of philosophers of science since the 1960s to emphasize corrigibility and anti-foundationalism in our interpretation of scientific knowledge; but a coherentist epistemology and a perspective of causal realism provides a philosophically powerful grounding for social science knowledge.  (See articles in the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy on coherence epistemology and scientific realism by Kvanvig and Boyd).In addition, in some areas of the natural sciences, there is the fact that cumulative scientific research leads to the invention of technologies that work as they were designed to do: new materials are invented in the electronics industry, new designs are created for large structures (buildings, aircraft, electron microscopes), and these materials and artifacts perform as expected on the basis of the underlying theories.  So scientific theories of materials, structures, and natural systems are supported by the effectiveness of the technologies that they give rise to.  If the theories and hypotheses were fundamentally untrue about the parts of the natural world that they describe, then we would expect the technologies to fail; the technologies do not fail; so we have some additional reason to believe the scientific theories that underlay these technologies.  (This is a version of Richard Boyd\u2019s argument of methodological realism.)Is there anything analogous to the relationship between the natural sciences and technology, for the social and behavioral sciences?  On the whole, there is not.  Social predictions are notoriously unreliable; public policies based on social-science theory commonly give rise to unanticipated consequences; and the twists and turns of deliberate social processes (war, alliance, efforts to address global warming) continue to surprise us.  This unpredictability in the social world derives from the nature of social action.  Human behavior and social processes are plainly subject to an open-ended range of causes, motives, and influences. The construction of various areas of science with the goal of understanding and explaining this multiplicity is therefore a profoundly challenging task.Here, then, is a very elliptical description of a plausible interpretation of social science epistemology: There are empirical foundations for knowledge in the form of social observation (empiricism); there are social causes that influence social behavior, processes, and outcomes (causal realism); there is no a priori reason to expect strong generalizations across social phenomena, \u201cregulating\u201d the social world; and there is no reason to expect unified master theories of social phenomena, suggesting instead a preference for theories of the middle range."}, {"title": "Change?", "date": "Tuesday, September 2, 2008", "text": "The word of the day is \"change\" -- the political conventions are blaring it out, and apparently the voting public is ready for it.It's worth thinking about what \"change\" amounts to. Things change in many ways -- by accident, by the inevitable workings of natural processes, or as a result of the actions of people and groups.  The eruption of Mt. Krakatoa in 1883 changed many things in the world, for better or worse.  But this isn't what \"change\" means in this context.When people talk about \"change\" in a political or social context, they are referring to outcomes that can be influenced by human agency and choice.  We want to change the pace of global warming -- that is, we want to take deliberate steps that will result in a slowing of the buildup of greenhouse gases globally.  We want to change the \"pay to play\" mentality that many city governments have permitted to develop between contractors and politicians -- that is, we want to create a new set of regulations and laws that do a better job of controlling corrupt practices in city government.  We want to change the level of threat of terrorist attack that the United States faces -- that is, we want our leaders to design a set of strategies for diplomatic, military, and intelligence agency actions that will reduce the motivation of potential attackers or interfere with the execution of their plans.  We want to change the degree of disparities of income and quality of life that is found among Americans in this century -- that is, we want a set of government and economic policies that have the effect of increasing income and quality of life for the least-well-off.So the relevant meaning of \"change\" has to do with actions, goals, and strategies.  Calls for change in this sense generally mean one of three things: we need to change direction -- the things we're aiming at aren't quite the right mix.  We need to change strategies -- our plans for intervening in the world on the basis of which we are pursuing our goals aren't working well enough.  Or we need to change the way we operate -- to embody greater transparency, greater allegiance to human rights, greater honesty.  Change is about agency in the world -- the things we aim at, the means we use, and the principles we adopt.Government -- its policies, its strategies, its priorities -- is at the center of what people are concerned about when they call for change.  This is true primarily because governments have the greatest ability to influence the outcomes that we care about the most; but it is also true because governments have badly disappointed us at various junctures in our history, by pursuing the wrong goals or bungling their efforts to achieve the right goals.  So it's not a bit surprising that a debate about the need for change would crop up around the moment of this critical election in the United States.People are calling for change today because they are dissatisfied with the outcomes, trends, strategies, and manner that current public actors are achieving. They see outcomes that are the result of deliberate policies -- but that are highly undesirable.  They see policies that are intelligently related to the achievement of certain goals -- but the goals are the wrong ones.  They see policies and initiatives that are ill-conceived and bungled. And, often enough, they see public actions that are morally defective in a variety of ways -- dishonest, devious, illegal, anti-democratic, self-interested, or hateful.So when people call for change, it would appear that they're asking for one of several possible kinds of change: a change of goals, a change of strategies, a change in the manner in which a government or corporation behaves, and perhaps a change in the personnel carrying out these actions.  They want to see public action to be aimed at goals that the majority in society can support when honestly conveyed.  They want to see policies and strategies that are well suited to achieving these goals, and supported by facts and analysis.  They want to see coordinated efforts by their governments that will lead to better outcomes and will put the trends onto a more acceptable course.  And they want to see a manner of action that respects the law and the requirements of a civil democracy.Let's hope that the next several months of political debate can really focus on these core questions: what problems do we most urgently need to solve in the next ten years in this society and this world?  What strategies and initiatives do the candidates propose to address these problems?  What evidence can we marshall to assess the likelihood that they will follow through with their stated intentions?  These are exactly the right debates; and once we think clearly about the goals and priorities we have as a nation, perhaps the choice we make among candidates will be less about personality and more about confidence in the program and the team that will implement it."}, {"title": "Cooperatives within markets", "date": "Friday, August 29, 2008", "text": "In a recent post on ChangingSociety I considered the question whether households in a rural community might be able to achieve energy self-sufficiency based on the cultivation of crops such as cattails and community production of ethanol. One question raised there is whether it is possible to estimate the land and labor that would be required for household self-sufficiency, and the other is whether we might describe an economically feasible distillery cooperative system that would permit a hundred families to distill their product.  Based on assumptions that are drawn from a number of sources out of a very complicated domain of knowledge about the economics of ethanol, I put together several scenarios to see what the lifestyle consequences would be for \"fuel farmers\".  A scenario based on moderate assumptions yielded these results: in order to produce a household stock of fuel of 2,400 gallons of ethanol, a household would need to cultivate 10 acres of cattails and would need to expend 4 hours per day year round on cultivation, harvesting, and distillery coop duties.What I'd like to focus on in this posting is the feasibility and characteristics of cooperatives as a way for small- and medium-sized communities to handle some of the key material activities they need to accomplish.  In a modern society we are so accustomed to market mechanisms and individual decision-making that it is somewhat difficult to imagine how coops might work in modern circumstances.  So, for the example under consideration here, the market scenario is straightforward: farmers grow cattails to serve as a raw material for a privately owned distillery; the price of the cattails is eventually determined as a function of the quantity and value of the final products of distillation (ethanol and feed); and cattail farming is simply another crop within the private farmer's portfolio.  And if the business case for a privately developed distillery is favorable -- that is, the raw materials will be available in sufficient quantity and low price and the value of the product will be sufficient to provide a profit -- then entrepreneurs will emerge to fill this economic niche.  Everyone's interests are satisfied: farmers earn more income, private owners earn a profit, and society is presented with a growing volume of renewable fuels.But consider the downside of this market-based story from the fuel farmers' point of view.  They have no control over the price that their cattail crop will bring; they are subject to the vagaries of commodity prices and the semi-monopoly position held by the local distillery; and they are likely to believe that the \"middle man\" is taking too much of their crop and labor in the form of profits.  And, after all, the farmers' interest is in achieving a sustainable energy supply -- not simply a level of income consistent with the budget necessities of everyday life.  They're growing the cattails because they are a source of energy that can be produced and consumed separately from the market.   So passing through the market twice -- selling the raw materials and purchasing ethanol -- seems like an unnecessary and risky detour; why not simply turn the crop into ethanol directly without passing through the marketplace?So the fuel farmer has an interest in directly capturing the energy content of the crop, not simply growing another kind of cash crop.  This could be done by establishing a farm still and processing the crop directly; but there are significant economies of scale in distillation, so this is not an ideal solution.  An inefficient distillation process simply means that the farmer must farm a larger area and expend more labor in order to arrive at the net quantity of fuel required.  A better solution would result from sharing the distillation process among an extended group of households and maintaining a small to medium-sized distillery for the use of the community. So we might imagine leaders coming forward who propose the establishment of a cooperative distillery.  Coop members would share costs, labor time, and ethanol based on the volume of feedstock that they provide to the process.  If all households were farming roughly the same amount of land at the same level of intensity, then all households would contribute cash and labor equally and would \"earn\" the same quantity of ethanol from the process.So now let's do a little bit of scenario building.  Suppose there is a turnkey distillery operation that can be purchased for $2 million, with a well-documented set of technical efficiency characteristics.  (That way prospective coop members know what they're getting into.)  The distillery processes 60,000 pounds of biomass a day and produces about 2,000 gallons of ethanol.  The distillation process requires 30 hours of labor per day.  And this scale of production is about right for the needs of a cooperative involving 100 households.   Members are required to accept joint financial responsibility for debt and operations of the coop, and they are required to provide their full share of coop labor at the distillery based on a schedule of work times. And, given the technical characteristics of farming and distilling, they can be confident that their fuel farming labor will result in a quantity of biomass that will entitle them to 2,400 gallons of ethanol annually.  On a plausible set of assumptions, this means that each household will have coop dues of $2,200 and a monthly labor obligation of 6 hours.So far, so good; this sounds like a good deal for each of the households.  Each household satisfies its annual energy needs with an investment of $2,200 in cash and about 1,000 hours of labor expended on cultivation, harvesting, transporting, and distilling; whereas the cost of purchasing this volume of ethanol would be about $10,000. So what obstacles might arise in implementing this cooperative solution to the problem of energy self-sufficiency?There are several predictable challenges that this scenario is likely to raise, including especially in the areas of governance, technical management, work management, accounting, trust, taxation, and sustainability over time.Governance.  The cooperative needs to make decisions about management, maintenance, and improvement of the facility.  How should this be done?  Are all decisions to be taken on the basis of a vote by the membership?  Should there be an executive committee with some powers of decision-making?  Is there an executive manager?  How will conflicts among coop members be managed and resolved?Technical management. The distillery is technically complex.  Maintenance requires skilled technicians or millwrights.  Can the coop count on these kinds of expertise among its membership?  Will it need to hire outside experts and engineers to maintain the facility?  Who will take responsibility for maintaining safety processes and standards within the facility?Work management.  Who will supervise the work of coop members while they are performing their tasks during coop labor?  Is there a likelihood of \"easy riding\" -- coop members who bring their blackberries to work and keep checking their email rather than cleaning the boiler?  What kinds of discipline processes are feasible within a coop -- for example, fines imposed on \"no-show\" workers?  Will the coop need to reward internal experts with a somewhat larger share of the product? Accounting. There is a very substantial amount of accounting of inputs and outputs that needs to be accomplished.  As coop members pull up with a load of biofuel the quantity and quality needs to be measured and recorded.  Clear formulas governing the pay-out of ethanol need to be codified.  There is a time lag between depositing the feedstock and withdrawing the ethanol; rules need to be established that govern the household's entitlement to a given quantity of ethanol on a regular basis (weekly, monthly, quarterly?).Trust.  Members need to have a substantial level of trust in each other and in the non-professional managers of the process.  Theft of assets is always a possibility by managers.  Fraud on the part of coop members is also possible -- for example, mixing non-feedstock materials into a load of feedstock and taking credit for 6,000 pounds rather than 5,500 pounds of stock.  More careful inspection procedures have a cost -- more labor time from the membership.  Members need to be confident that other members will continue to pay their dues -- otherwise the debt obligations of the coop fall on a smaller and smaller circle of dues-payers. Taxation. The cooperative is likely to face expanding demand for improvements of the facility, the technology, or the use of labor.  This means raising the obligations imposed on coop members, in the form of coop dues, a percentage of their ethanol share, or an increase in labor time required by coop members.  How will these increases in assessment be decided?Sustainability over time.   The economics of the cooperative distillery depend on a certain size of membership -- say 100 households.  Like any human organization, there will be exits from the cooperative -- retirements, relocation, discouragement.  Will the cooperative be able to continually recruit new members in sufficient numbers to keep the process in the black?  Is there the risk of the \"dying seminar\" that Thomas Schelling writes about -- decline leading to rising costs for the remaining members, leading to further decline in membership (Micromotives and Macrobehavior)?So -- there are significant challenges of governance, management, and trust that stand in the way of a successful cooperative.  This doesn't mean that cooperatives are impossible to create or sustain, or that they don't have significant economic advantages for their members.  But perhaps it does explain why this is not a common solution so far in modern social settings as a way of securing coordination and shared economic benefits among a mid-sized group of persons or households.  At the same time, it seems very worthwhile to expend effort on trying to resolve these issues in ways that make cooperative arrangements more feasible and sustainable than they currently are in modern society."}, {"title": "The difference ontology makes", "date": "Wednesday, August 27, 2008", "text": "Quite a few posts here over the past few months have been on the subject of social ontology: what can we say about the nature of the social world? I've focused on characteristics like heterogeneity, plasticity, and contingency, and have also given thought to some of the processes through which social phenomena are \"composed\" of lower-level processes and mechanisms. (The topics of methodological individualism, localism, and holism fall in this category.) Why are these questions important to the philosophy of social science? And how could they possibly contribute to better research and theory in the social sciences?One answer is that it isn't really possible to investigate any domain without having some idea of what sorts of things the domain consists of. So attempting to arrive at perspicuous models of what the social world is made up of is a necessary step on the way to more specific forms of empirical and causal research.A second answer derives from recognition of the harm that has been done to the cause of knowledge by misconceived ontologies in the history of science. This has been especially true in areas of knowledge adjoining human life and activity -- radical behaviorism in psychology, naturalism and positivism in sociology, and what Andrew Abbott calls the \"variables paradigm\" in quantitative social science.  Better science will result from more propititious ontology, because we won't be in the situation of trying to force the social world onto the wrong sorts of boxes.Third, there are good reasons for thinking that reasoning about social ontology is possible. If ontological thinking were purely apriori, then we might be reasonably skeptical about our capacity to move from philosophy to the world. But we have a form of access to social reality that we lack for the realities of nature and mathematics: we are participants in social reality and our thoughts and actions are constitutive of that reality. So theorizing about social reality of ontology isn't wholly apriori; rather, it is more akin to a form of intelligent observation of real social processes around us. Ontological thinking is really a form of empirically informed theorizing, at a fairly abstract level.Let's turn now to the question of how concretely better social ontological thinking can help create better social research.Researchers will be encouraged to explore multiple methodologies and theories when a more satisfactory social ontology guides them. Pluralism finds strong support in the ontology explored here, given the emphasis offered to social heterogeneity and contingency.Some specific research strategies and questions are likely to arise as a result of more adequate social ontologies. Questions about causal mechanisms and processes of composition will receive special attention.Fields of research like comparative historical sociology and case study methods will receive theoretical support and encouragement, since these approaches are particularly well suited to the ontological ideas revolving around heterogeneity, plasticity, and composition.So, to return to the original question: it is in fact very appropriate and potentially helpful for philosophy of social science to give more attention to social ontology than it has traditionally done. The social world of the twenty-first century is chaotic and rapidly changing, and we need better mental frameworks within which to attempt to make sense of this complexity and change."}, {"title": "Power and social class", "date": "Sunday, August 24, 2008", "text": "What does social class have to do with power?  The two concepts represent theories about how a modern society works, and there are some fundamental relationships between them.  But at bottom they are separate social factors that allow for independent forms of social causation.  The first is fundamentally concerned with the economic structure of a society, the systems through which wealth is created and distributed, and the second is concerned with the expressions of politics within a society.Both class and power can be placed into the dichotomies of structure and agency.  The class system sets some of the parameters of \"structure\" within which individuals act, but it also creates some of the motivations and features of consciousness that constitute the agency of class actors.  The forms of power present in a given society define some of the features of agency on the basis of which individuals and groups pursue their goals; but it is also fair to say that the institutions and social relations that define social power are also a part of the structured environment of action that is present in the social world.  So both power and class are simultaneously features of structure and agency within a complex society; and the configurations created by class and power are causally inter-related without being isomorphic.A class system can be defined as a system for producing social wealth in which productive resources and the results of production are unevenly divided across different groups. The producing class is \"exploited\" by the ascendant class: wealth is transferred from producers to owners.  Serfs and lords, slaves and masters, workers and owners represent the primary classes of feudalism, ancient slavery, and nineteenth century capitalism.  Within any society there are groups that fall outside the primary classes -- small traders, artisans, small farmers, intellectuals.  But it is central to Marx's theory of class, that there is a primary cleavage between owners of the means of production and the direct producers, and that this cleavage embodies a fundamental conflict of interest between the two groups.\"Power\" is a compound social characteristic in virtue of which an individual or group is able to compel the actions or inactions of other individuals or groups against their will or contrary to their interests, needs, and desires.  Power derives from the ability to impose coercion -- truncheons, prisons, and punishment; and it derives from the ability of some agents within society to set the agenda for future action.  Power is needed to get 1.5 million people to leave their homes in Beijing to make way for Olympics developments.  Power is needed to prevent striking miners from shutting down La Paz.   Power is needed to protect the glittering shop windows of Johannesburg from disaffected young people.  Power is exercised by states -- through military and police, through agencies and bureaucracies, through legislation; it is exercised by corporations and other large private organizations; and it is exercised by social movements and other groups within society.The two social factors are intertwined in at least three ways.First, a class system constitutes a set of social inequalities within which there are deep conflicts of interest. So a class system sets the stage for the exercise of power; various groups have an interest in wielding power over others within a class system. Ascendant groups have an interest in sustaining the productive economic activities of subordinates whom they exploit, and they have an interest in squelching acts of resistance. But likewise, subordinate groups have an interest in using instruments of power to reduce or overturn the exploitative social relations within which they function.Second, a class system assigns resources and positions to different groups and individuals that greatly influence the nature and weight of the instruments and tactics of power available to them. Owners have economic assets, alliances, and the state in their column. Producers have their numbers and their key locations in the economic process. A strike of rail workers is a substantial exercise of power, given the centrality of transport in a complex economy.  So the particulars of a class system provide key determinants of the distribution of power within society.Third, a class system also creates a subjectivity of power, powerlessness, and resistance that may iterate into new forms of the exercise of power. It may be an effective instrument of social control to cultivate a subjectivity of powerlessness in subordinate groups. And likewise, it may be materially empowering to subordinate groups to cultivate a culture of resistance -- by making collective action and solidarity more attainable, for example.These are several ways in which facts about class and power intertwine.  But power is wielded for non-economic purposes as well -- effecting the will of the state, achieving ethnic domination, and influencing culture, for example.   So it would be incorrect to imagine that power is simply the cutting edge of class conflict."}, {"title": "Trust", "date": "Thursday, August 21, 2008", "text": "What is the role of trust in ordinary social workings? I would say that a fairly high level of trust is simply mandatory in any social group, from a family to a workplace to a full society. Lacking trust, each agent is forced into a kind of Hobbesian calculation about the behavior of those around him or her, watching for covert strategies in which the other is trying to take advantage of oneself. The cost of self-protection is impossibly high in a zero-trust society. Gated communities don't help. We would need to have gated and solitary lives. Even our brothers and sisters, spouses, and offspring would have to be watched suspiciously. We would live like Howard Hughes at the end of his life.To begin, what is trust? It is a condition of reliance on the statements, assurances, and basic good behavior of others. The status of commitments over time is essential to trust.  We need to consider whether we can trust a neighbor who has promised to return a lawn mower -- will he keep his promise? Can we trust the car park attendant not to take the iPod from the glove compartment? Can we trust the phone company to not add hidden fees to our bill in a corporate decision that they won't be noticed by most consumers?It is sort of a commonplace in moral philosophy that you can't trust a pure egoist or an act utilitarian. The reason is simple: trust means reliance on the correct behavior of other agents even when there is an opportunity for gain in incorrect behavior and the probability of detection and sanctions is low. The egoist will reason on the basis of the advantage he/she anticipates and will discount the low likelihood of sanction. But likewise, the act utilitarian will add up all the utilities created by \"correct action\" and \"incorrect action\", and will be bound to choose the action with the greater utility. The fact of an existing promise or other obligation will not change the calculation. So the act utilitarian cannot be trusted to honor his promises and obligations, no matter what.Standards of \"correct behavior\" are difficult to articulate precisely, but here's a start: telling the truth, keeping promises and assurances when they come into play, acting according to generally shared rules of professional and social ethics, and respecting the rights of others. We sometimes describe people and organizations whose behavior conforms to these sorts of characteristics as possessing \"integrity\".In general, agents whose behavior is governed solely by calculation of consequences cannot be trusted, since occasions requiring trust are precisely those in which we need to rely on others to do the right thing in spite of consequences that would favor doing the wrong thing. (For example, taking the iPod in circumstances where there are dozens of attendants and the theft cannot be attributed to one person; keeping the lawnmower if the owner is in a state of rapid-onset dementia; adding the phony charges in a business environment where it can be predicted with confidence that only 5% of customers will notice and the penalties are trivial.)So there are two basic models of action that people can choose: consequentialist and \"constrained by obligations\" (deontological). The first approach is opportunistic and myopic; the other reflects integrity and the validity of long-term obligations.But here we have a problem.  The most ordinary social transactions become almost impossible in a no-trust environment. If I can't trust my bank to hold my savings honestly, or my employer to keep its commitments about my retirement accounts, or the passenger on the seat next to me on a long airplane flight to not go through my briefcase if I drift off to sleep -- then I am forced into a condition of exhausting, sleepless vigilance. And, of course, we do generally trust in these circumstances.But it is an interesting problem for research to consider whether different societies and groups elicit and sustain different levels of trust in ordinary life, and what the institutional factors are that affect this outcome. Is there a higher level of trust in Bloomington, Illinois than Chicago or Houston? Is trust a feature of the learning environment through which people gain their social psychologies? Are there institutional features that encourage or discourage dispositions towards trust? And what are the compensating mechanisms through which social interactions proceed in a low-trust environment? Is that where \"trust but verify\" comes in?"}, {"title": "Composition of the social", "date": "Friday, August 15, 2008", "text": "Our social ontology needs to reflect the insight that complex social happenings are almost invariably composed of multiple causal processes rather than existing as unitary systems.  The phenomena of a great social whole -- a city over a fifty-year span, a period of sustained social upheaval or revolution (Iran in the 1970s-1980s), an international trading system -- should be conceptualized as the sum of a large number of separate processes with intertwining linkages and often highly dissimilar tempos. We can provide analysis and theory for some of the component processes, and we can attempt to model the results of aggregating these processes. And we can attempt to explain the patterns and exceptions that arise as the consequence of one or more of these processes. Some of the subordinate processes will be significantly amenable to theorizing and projection, and some will not. And the totality of behavior will be more than the \"sum\" of the relatively limited number of processes that are amenable to theoretical analysis. This means that the behavior of the whole will demonstrate contingency and unpredictability modulo the conditions and predictable workings of the known processes.Consider the example of the development of a large city over time.  The sorts of subordinate processes that I'm thinking of here might include -- The habitation dynamics created by the nodes of a transportation system The dynamics of electoral competition governing the offices of mayor and city council The politics of land use policy and zoning permits The dynamics and outcomes of public education on the talent level of the population Economic development policies and tax incentives emanating from state government Dynamics of real estate system with respect to race Employment and poverty characteristics of surrounding regionEach of these processes can be investigated by specialists -- public policy experts, sociologists of race and segregation, urban politics experts.  Each contributes to features of the evolving urban environment. And it is credible that there are consistent patterns of behavior and development within these various types of processes.  This justifies a specialist's approach to specific types of causes of urban change, and rigorous social science can result.But it must also be recognized that, there are system interdependencies among these groups of factors.  More in-migration of extremely poor families may put more stress on the public schools. Enhancement of quality or accessibility of public schools may increase in-migration (the Kalamazoo promise, for example). Political incentives within the city council system may favor land-use policies that encourage the creation of racial or ethnic enclaves. So it isn't enough to understand the separate processes individually; we need to make an effort to discover these endogenous relations among them.But over and above this complication of the causal interdependency of recognized factors, there is another and more pervasive complication as well.  For any given complex social whole, it is almost always the case that there are likely to be additional causal processes that have not been separately analyzed or theorized. Some may be highly contingent and singular -- for example, the many effects that September 11 had on NYC. Others may be systemic and important, but novel and previously untheorized -- for example, the global information networks that Saskia Sassen emphasizes for the twenty-first century global city.The upshot is that a complex social whole exceeds the particular theories we have created for this kind of phenomenon at any given point in time. The social whole is composed of lower-level processes; but it isn't exhausted by any specific list of underlying processes.  Therefore we shouldn't imagine that the ideal result of investigation of urban phenomena is a comprehensive theory of the city -- the goal is chimerical. Social science is always \"incomplete\", in the sense that there are always social processes relevant to social outcomes that have not been theorized.Is there any type of social phenomenon that is substantially more homogeneous than this description would suggest -- with the result that we might be able to arrive a neat, comprehensive theories of this kind of social entity?  Consider these potential candidates: inner city elementary schools, labor unions, wars of national liberation, civil service bureaus, or multi-national corporations.  One might make the case that these terms capture a group of phenomena that are fairly homogeneous and would support simple, unified theories.  But I think that this would be mistaken.  Rather, much the same kind of causal complexity that is presented by the city of Chicago or London is also presented by elementary schools and labor unions.  There are multiple social, cultural, economic, interpersonal, and historical factors that converge on a particular school in a particular place, or a particular union involving specific individuals and issues; and the characteristics of the school or the union are influenced by this complex convergence of factors.  (On the union example, consider Howard Kimeldorf's fascinating study, Battling for American Labor: Wobblies, Craft Workers, and the Making of the Union Movement.  Kimeldorf demonstrates the historical contingency and the plurality of social and business factors that led to the significant differences among dock workers' unions in the United States.)What analytical frameworks available for capturing this understanding of the compositional nature of society? I have liked the framework of causal mechanisms, suggesting as it does the idea of there being separable causal processes underlying particular social facts that are diverse and amenable to investigation. The ontology of \"assemblages\" captures the idea as well, in its ontology of separable sub-processes. (Nick Srnicek provides an excellent introduction to assemblage theory in his master's thesis.)  And the language of microfoundations, methodological localism, and the agent-structure nexus convey much the same idea as well. In each case, we have the idea that the social entity is composed of underlying processes that take us back in the direction of agents acting within the context of social and environmental constraints. And we have a premise of causal openness: the behavior of the whole is not fully determined by a particular set of subordinate mechanisms or assemblages."}, {"title": "What is a peasant?", "date": "Thursday, August 14, 2008", "text": "Quite a bit of China's history has been framed in terms of the role of the \"peasant\" in Chinese society.  Historians consider the features of the peasant economy; they examine the occurrence and dynamics of peasant rebellions and peasant mobilization; they ask about peasant culture and consciousness.  What is a peasant?  Is it a sociologically useful concept?To start, we might consider a simple definition.  A peasant is a smallholding farmer, producing crops for family consumption and for market exchange, using family labor throughout the farming cycle.  Peasants live in villages; they engage in face-to-face relations with neighboring farmers; they possess a diverse range of cultural and religious beliefs and practices; they fall within a diverse range of social networks and local organizations (kinship organizations, temples, labor-sharing networks). (Robert Netting's Smallholders, Householders: Farm Families and the Ecology of Intensive, Sustainable Agriculture provides a particularly astute analysis of peasant life.)So peasants are farmers.  But even within a society that is largely rural with a high percentage of smallholding farmers, there is still substantial social diversity within local society.  Small traders, necromancers, martial arts instructors, bandits, minor officials, priests, moneylenders, elites, scholars, and large land owners all play roles within a peasant society -- but they are not peasants.  Their incomes derive ultimately from the farm economy, but their lifestyles, standards of living, values, and social status are all distinct from those of peasant farmers.  So there is occupational diversity within rural society in almost every part of China, and a \"peasant society\" consists of many people who are not themselves \"peasants\".The definition of the peasant just offered focuses on the occupational or material situation of the individual.  It is not surprising, then, that materialist social theory has given particular emphasis to the category of \"peasant society\" as a potentially explanatory social category.  Marxist analysis gives substantial importance to the situation of peasants and workers, and other non-Marxist materialist thinkers have done so as well.But we can reasonably ask whether this set of \"existential\" facts have very much to do with a person's mentality and political behavior.  Recall the very great range of social environments in which farming takes place in China -- from the rice paddies and deltas of the lower Yangzi, to the wheat farms of Hebei and Shandong in the north, to the mountainous plots of Yunnan in the southwest.  Recall as well the cultural diversity that occurs across this range -- different ethnic groups, different local traditions, different religious and lineage practices.  So it is worth asking the question, to what extent do members of village society share a peasant consciousness, simply in virtue of their social position as farmers? Is there any reason to believe that the material factors that define one's status as \"peasant\" are more fundamental to consciousness than the cultural or ethnic factors having to do with one's immediate social milieu? Does the peasantry constitute a distinct social group?There are some shared features of peasant experience that would provide a partial answer to this question.  First is the common experience of insecurity.  Farmers are more vulnerable than most economic groups to the vagaries of weather, water, and soil.  Second is the fact of surplus extraction.  Because they are the most numerous group in most traditional societies, the state and other powerful agents in society have an interest in extracting part of the peasant's surplus from him/her.  This occurs through rent, interest, and taxation.  And it is a commonplace that the peasant's life is often held hostage to predatory surplus extraction. Peasants are close to be bottom of the ladder when it comes to power, status, and influence -- so they are vulnerable to exploitation.These considerations suggest that there is in fact an important basis of group mobilization that is associated with one's status as \"peasant\".  Farmers share an interest in famine relief, drought assistance, and collective action against predatory taxation or rent increases; so their status as peasants may contribute to deliberate efforts aimed at the development of class consciousness and group identity formation.  Peasant organizations may emerge that deliberately cultivate political action and consciousness around peasant issues.  And this in turn suggests a more complicated answer to the primary question here: one's status as a peasant may not determine one's outlook on the social world or one's mentality; but the struggles associated with making a life within the context of rents, taxation, drought, and famine may lead to the forging of a peasant consciousness that does in fact influence political behavior and solidarity."}, {"title": "History, memory, and narrative", "date": "Tuesday, August 12, 2008", "text": "Photo: LI Zhensheng, Top Party officials are denounced during an afternoon-long rally in Red Guard Square: Wang Yilun (left) is accused of being a \u201cblack gang element.\u201d Harbin, 29 August 1966What is the relation between \"history\", \"memory\", and \"narrative\"?  We might put these concepts into a crude map by saying that \"history\" is an organized and evidence-based presentation of of the processes and events that have occurred for a people over an extended period of time; \"memory\" is the personal recollections and representations of individuals who lived through a series of events and processes; and \"narratives\" are the stories that historians and ordinary people weave together to make sense of the events and happenings through which a people and a person have lived.  We use narratives to connect the dots of things that have happened; to identify causes and meanings within this series of events; and to select the \"important\" events and processes out from the ordinary and inconsequential.If we think that \"history\" should be informed by the ways in which historical events were experienced by individuals, then we must also address the question of how to use the evidence of memory as a prism for attributing subjective, lived experience to the people who lived this history.  If we are interested in the Great Leap Forward famine years, for example, we need to know more than the timeline of harvest failure or the map of grain distress across China; we need to know how various groups experienced this time of hardship.  And for this we need to have access to documents and interviews reporting the experience of individuals in their own words; we need to have access to memory.A particularly valuable body of work on China's recent history is currently underway, in the form of careful use of oral histories, memoirs, and other expressions of personal memories of some of China's most dramatic chapters of national history.  C. K. Lee and Guobin Yang have presented some excellent examples of this work in Re-envisioning the Chinese Revolution: The Politics and Poetics of Collective Memory in Reform China.   The book contains chapters that draw out important new insights into the Cultural  Revolution, the Great Leap Forward, the changing conditions of women, cinema, the experience of ethnic minorities, and the occurrence of violence and disorder in the past sixty years in China's history.  Every chapter sheds new light on something of interest; the book is an absorbing read.  Especially interesting are chapters by Paul Pickowicz and Guobin Yang.In \"Rural Protest Letters: Local Perspectives on the State's War on Tillers\" Paul Pickowicz describes an extensive collection of interviews and private writings of a single Hebei peasant leader, Geng Xiufeng, written between  the 1950s and the 1990s. Geng's writings often take the form of protest letters, addressed to leaders extending from local party officials to Chairman Mao himself.  Geng also maintained a journal in which he recorded his observations of the effects of various state-directed reforms of agriculture -- and the inimical effects these reforms had on peasant standard of living.   Geng was a peasant activist and leader in the 1940s in support of rural cooperatives, as a practical mechanism for improving agriculture and improving local peasants' standard of living.  And he turns out to be an astute and honest observer of the twists and turns of policy disaster (rapid collectivization of agriculture), corruption, and disregard of peasants' welfare by the CCP.  (This latter is the meaning of Pickowicz's phrase, \"the state's war on tillers.\") Pickowicz had conducted a number of interviews with Geng in the 1970s and 1980s, and was greatly surprised to learn that Geng had written dozens of protest letters and had accumulated a multi-volume memoir that chronicled many of these social observations about change in North China.  The content of these writings is fascinating; but even more important is the evidence they offer of the astute abilities possessed by ordinary Chinese people in observing and criticizing the processes of change that enmeshed them.  These manuscripts offer Pickowicz -- and us -- a window into the consciousness of some ordinary rural people as China's history enveloped them; and they make evident the fact that Chinese peasants were not mere passive instruments, but rather practical, observant, and sometimes wise thinkers about revolution and reform.Guobin Yang's article, \"'A Portrait of Martyr Jiang Qing': The Chinese Cultural Revolution on the Internet\" touches the other end of the information spectrum -- not handwritten letters and reflections penned in the 1950s, but over 100 contemporary websites devoted to archiving and chronicling the Cultural Revolution.  There are widely divergent stories that can be told in defining the Cultural Revolution as an episode of history: an excess of leftism, a deliberate use of power by China's leaders against each other and against society, a period of social hysteria, or even \"still a good idea.\"  (The latter is the theme taken by the website incorporated into Yang's title -- \"A Portrait of Martyr Jiang Qing.\"  This is one of the few publicly available websites that Yang unearthed that continues to glorify Madame Mao and her fellow radicals.)  Yang demonstrates that we can learn a lot about how the current generation views the Cultural Revolution -- and the strands of disagreement that continue to divide opinion about its causes and meanings -- by examining in detail the editorial judgments and online commentaries that accompany these online \"exhibition halls\".The use of photography and cinema to represent memory -- both individual and collective -- is an important theme in the volume.  The photograph above, representing a \"struggle\" session against \"class enemies,\" captures a particular moment in time -- two particular men, exposed to a particular crowd.  It also emblemizes scenes that were common throughout China during the Cultural Revolution.  And, presumably, it triggers very specific personal memories for individual Chinese people who lived through the Cultural Revolution, whether as victims, Red Guards, or bystanders. As David Davies notes in \"Visible Zhiqing: The Visual Culture of Nostalgia among China's Zhiqing Generation\", no photograph stands wholly by itself.  But some photos have the directness and honesty needed to stand for a whole dimension of historical experience -- in this case, the violence and humiliation perpetrated against teachers, scholars, and officials by zealous mobs of Red Guards and their followers.  In this way the photo can faithfully capture one important strand of the history of this period.One thing I particularly appreciate in the volume is the innovative thinking it provides about the nexus of experience, identity, and history.   The editors and contributors are very sensitive to the fact that there is no single \"Hebei experience\" or \"Chinese women's experience\"; instead, the oral history materials permit the contributors to discern both variation and some degree of thematicization of memory and identity.Another important contribution of the volume is the emphasis it offers to the idea of the agency involved in memory.  Memories must be created; agents must find frameworks within which to understand their moments of historical experience.  \"As people grope for moral and cognitive frameworks to understand, assess, and sometimes resist these momentous changes in their lives, memories of the revolution thrive\" (1).A third and equally important thrust of the volume is the persuasive idea that memories become part of the political mobilization possibilities that exist for a group.  Groups find their collective identities through shared understandings of the past; and these shared understandings provide a basis for future collective action.  So memory, identity, and mobilization hang together."}, {"title": "Leaders within complex organizations", "date": "Thursday, August 7, 2008", "text": "Complex organizations depend on an extended group of leaders who have the responsibility of articulating and carrying out the missions of the organization. Leadership groups within complex organizations should be expected to be a factor that influences the performance of the organization, for better or worse.  Here I am thinking of medium-sized organizations -- 500-2500 employees -- with some degree of functional specialization -- for example, a manufacturing company with divisions of manufacturing, marketing and sales, product design, finance and accounting, human resources, and government relations or a university with divisions of academic affairs, student recruitment, business and finance, student affairs, and external relations.The complexity of an organization stems from the fact that a number of different kinds of activities are being carried out simultaneously by different groups of people, and there is no authoritative single \"master bureaucrat\" who sets tasks and oversees results for all agents of the organization.  Inevitably there is some degree of decentralization of activity, with decision-makers at a variety of levels who are empowered to set the agendas of their units in such a way as to best achieve the overall goals of the organization.  And higher-level leaders have a responsibility for attempting to achieve a suitable degree of collaboration and communication among lower-level leaders to make it likely that the activities of the units will contribute to a coherent and effective effort to achieve the organization's goals.  And complex organizations that fail to achieve a sufficient degree of coordination of effort internally wind up being pretty unsuccessful; their product is often one that reflects the specific needs of each of the units, but fails to satisfy the overall goals of the organization. (This is the point of the joke that a camel is a horse designed by committee.)Here are some of the central tasks of an organization's leaders.  Leaders help set the strategic direction for the organization; they implement actions and processes at unit-levels within the organization; they collaborate with each other in efforts to achieve higher effectiveness within and across units; they seek out opportunities for new activities or initiatives that will further one or more priorities for the organization.  And, as anyone knows who has worked within a variety of organizations -- both organizations and leadership groups function at a very wide range of effectiveness, from the dysfunctional to the superb.Why are leaders important to the effectiveness of the organization?  Because they serve to articulate the goals of the organization and the sub-units; they work with others to articulate strategies and activities for achieving these goals; they motivate staff within their units to carry out strategies; and they have the organizational resources needed to arrive at collaborative efforts across units.  Persons who are good at these various activities will make the organization more effective; and persons who are less good at them will pull the organization down.  The leader who tends to demoralize his/her staff is unlikely to be able to stimulate high-quality work within the unit; persons who defend their turf rather than looking for opportunities for cross-unit collaboration will interfere with the organization's ability to achieve coherence of effort and synergies of collaboration.So what are some of the features of good leadership skills and a good leadership team?  Here is the list I would offer as an observer of several organizations.  Good leaders are cognitively and emotionally ready for collaboration; they are ready to see the gains that can come from honest and sustained efforts at solving problems that cut across the scope of several units.  Second, good leaders are attuned to the shared mission and values that the organization has adopted.  They don't excessively favor the particular interests of their unit over the larger priorities of the organization; instead, they attempt to align the activities of the unit with the priorities of the organization.  Third, good leaders are committed to effective management of their own areas. They attempt to bring best practices into all the activities for which they are responsible.  Fourth, they have the ability to motivate the members of their teams, building trust among team members and a degree of unity about the goals to which the unit is oriented. Fifth, they possess a willingness to innovate.  They are problem-solvers who are actively seeking out new solutions to the problems their units face and the problems faced by the organization more generally.  Finally, they have a fundamental willingness to think broadly about the organization's needs and priorities beyond their own specific areas of responsibility.The defects that a leader or team can demonstrate are also fairly obvious.  Lack of communication is a common fault within organizations, leading to circumstances in which other leaders and team members are in the dark about current plans and strategies.  When Larry Bird stole the inbounds pass from Isiah Thomas in Game Six of the NBA Eastern finals in 1987, it was crucial that Dennis Johnson was already streaking to the basket.  Second, bad leaders engage in gamesmanship and bureaucratic rivalries, aiming to achieve their ends in opposition to their peers.  This obviously undermines trust, and it makes collaboration all but impossible.  Third, bad leaders are largely driven by narrow unit-based interests, or even their own personal interests, rather than the organizations priorities and goals.  And finally, bad leaders may display poor skills in motivating and managing the staff of the unit.These are a few speculative hypotheses about what makes one leadership group more effective than another.  But the hard question is this: what empirical methods exist for evaluating these hypotheses about effective leadership and management?  Are there credible methods of investigation that would permit organizational researchers to evaluate the causal importance of some of these features of leadership?  Or is \"leadership\" just one of those topics that has to be left to the \"management theory\" books that one finds in airport bookshops?This topic is relevant for understanding society, because much of the action in contemporary society is carried out by the complex organizations described here.  So having a better idea of how priorities and goals are linked up with concrete activities within an organization is a very important part of understanding the large social processes that jointly determine social change in the twenty-first century: economic development, social movements, educational progress, health care systems, and the like."}, {"title": "Rawls's schematic sociology", "date": "Wednesday, August 6, 2008", "text": "John Rawls offers an interesting thought along the way in his development of the theory of justice, on the question of the stability of a well-ordered society. \u00a0Basically, the idea is that a set of principles of justice need to satisfy a condition of publicity and social stability: the principles need to be such that, when everyone knows that these are the principles that regulate their social interactions and know that all others have the same knowledge, the society remains stable.Rawls puts the point this way:Now a well-ordered society is also regulated by its public conception of justice. \u00a0This fact implies that its members have a strong and normally effective desire to act as the principles of justice require. \u00a0Since a well-ordered society endures over time, its conception of justice is presumably stable: that is, when institutions are just (as defined by this conception), those taking part in these arrangements acquire the corresponding sense of justice and desire to do their part in maintaining them. \u00a0One conception of justice is more stable than another if the sense of justice that it tends to generate is stronger and more likely to override disruptive inclinations and if the institutions it allows foster weaker impulses and temptations to act unjustly. \u00a0The stability of a conception depends upon a balance of motives: the sense of justice that it cultivates and the aims that it encourages must normally win out against propensities toward injustice. \u00a0(A Theory of Justice, pp. 454-455)What is interesting here is that Rawls is engaging in a bit of sociological theorizing in this passage -- not simply apriori moral philosophy. \u00a0He is offering an analysis of the social psychology and motivations of people living within various frameworks of justice -- the principles governing the basic institutions and laws of a society -- and he hypothesizes that the social psychology of citizens is influenced by the features of justice that are embodied in their society. \u00a0The resulting social psychology in turn produces behavior that is more or less compatible with the continued stability of the institutions and laws. \u00a0A given set of institutions, generated by a certain theory of justice, gives rise to motivations on the part of citizens in ordinary life; and these motivations can be either stabilizing or destabilizing to the postulated institutions and framework of justice. \u00a0There is a feedback loop from institutions to social psychology to behavior to basic institutions.This raises an interesting question: how much of a role does a shared sense of justice play in sustaining a peaceful and stable society?One piece of the answer is straightforward: injustice is a common cause of societal conflict and violence.  Basic social relations that are perceived to involve unfair exploitation of one group by another are an obvious source of motivation towards resistance and group violence. Contrastively, institutions that are publicly recognized to treat all citizens fairly may promote a social psychology and a set of behaviors that are affirming of the institutions -- leading to harmonious social life and stable institutions.So Rawls's argument here does suggest an interesting conjunction of sociological reality and normative reasoning about justice. \u00a0Rawls returns to this topic in\u00a0Political Liberalism, where he questions the strong assumptions associated with the idea of a well-ordered society.  He offers instead the somewhat less demanding idea of an \"overlapping consensus\" as sufficient for a stable democracy.But a sense of being treated unfairly is only one out of numerous causes of social conflict.  Conflict can arise over numerous other types of issues as well: ethnic or religious identities, racism, neighborhood boundaries, and state policy, to name several. \u00a0And these areas of potential conflict are not addressed by Rawls's sketch of the sociology of a just society."}, {"title": "Components of one's \"social identity\"", "date": "Monday, August 4, 2008", "text": "A social identity is a complex thing.  It involves the ways in which one characterizes oneself, the affinities one has with other people, the ways one has learned to behave in stereotyped social settings, the things one values in oneself and in the world, and the norms that one recognizes or accepts governing everyday behavior.  And it profoundly affects the ways we behave and respond to the world.So a social identity invokes a number of different areas of psychological competence: knowledge, motivation, perception, memory, personality, and emotion, to name a few.  And yet one's social identity seems to stand a bit apart from any of these psychological concepts singly.  Cognitive psychology focuses on some aspects of this mix; social psychology and personality psychology focuses on other aspects; but there is no area of psychology that attempts to capture all of \"social identity\" as a psychological real process or structure.Moreover, a social identity is embodied in an individual; and yet it is produced by the experiences we have in relations to other individuals and groups.  A social identity can be said to be a feature of a group or a community as much as it is a feature of particular individuals within a given community.  And this fact is causally important: we can't explain the individual's identity without reference to the sustained and fairly consistent features of the group with respect to its social identity.  So a social identity has an aspect of \"social-ness\" that cautions us against a narrowly psychological interpretation of the concept.We might single out a number of aspects of a social identity as a psychologically real construct, embodied in a particular person through a particular body of experience and a specific location within a community:an epistemic frame in terms of which I understand the social worldan element of my psycho-cognitive-emotional apparatusa model of how to behave in certain common social settingsa self-ascription defining the features of action and comportment that are most defining of \"me\" in the worlda self-valorization of the things that are most worthwhile to mean account of who I'm related to and similar to; who my affinity groups area map expressing my location within a particular extended communityIn addition, it is important to recognize the feature of \"intersectionality\" that characterizes social identities: the ways in which one's identity involves a crossing of different grounds of identity and affinity.  (University of Michigan social psychologist Elizabeth Cole has published a useful recent article called \"Coalitions as a Model for Intersectionality: From Practice to Theory\" in Sex Roles; here is a link.  I also found the Wikipedia article on intersectionality to be valuable.)Identities aren't \"pure\" expressions of one particular feature of one's location in the social world; instead, features of sexual identity, geographical identity, class identity, racial and ethnic identity, professional identity, and cohort identity all play a role in constituting one's overall identity.  This means that it is important to give concrete attention to the multiple forms of social influence and immersion through which a given individual comes to embody a complex social identity; we need to look to the microfoundations of identity formation.  (See more on this approach here.)And this point about intersectionality also raises the likelihood of internal conflict.  One's identity as an Asian American may be in some conflict with features of identity derived from one's location within the hip-hop generation or one's professional status as a junior member of an accounting firm.  And the modes of behavior implicated by one strand may be at odds with those created by the other strands.Innovative efforts to provide fresh approaches to the study of social identities are emerging in several fields.  Paula Moya and Michael Hames-Garcia's Reclaiming Identity: Realist Theory and the Predicament of Postmodernism is an introduction to a genuinely innovative approach to the study of identities that attempts to bring literary criticism, race and gender studies, and social theory into one extended discussion.How do we explain the occurrence of anti-social behavior that we witness in everyday life? For that matter, how do we explain the more common occurrence of good behavior?There are numerous extreme examples of anti-social behavior.  But more prosaic examples are more interesting. A passenger on a jet airliner becomes enraged at being denied additional alcohol; screams at and punches flight attendants; attempts to open the hatch at 20,000 feet. A couple continue to talk loudly on their cellphones -- during a blacktie dinner, interfering with the keynote speaker's presentation. When asked to be quiet, they say indignantly, \"this is important.\" A business traveler marches to the front of the security line and squeezes in front, saying, \"I'm in a rush.\" A parent enters a crowded elevator with a three-year-old child and stands by as the child presses all 15 buttons.  Most people are \"polite\". Most people treat others with consideration and respect. Most recognize the limits imposed on their behavior by the needs, wants and rights of others. But some do not -- they behave badly.I'm mostly interested here in the minor forms of bad behavior -- disturbing or endangering others, confronting others with aggressively rude behavior, taking more than a reasonable amount of \"space\" in public settings. Behaving boorishly is what I'm talking about -- noisy, intrusive, rude, and self-centered actions that impose on others or that greatly privilege one's own immediate wants.  This is the kind of behavior that once was attributed to American tourists, though today it seems to be the monopoly of no particular nationality.  (I've just been on vacation, so I've been exposed to a lot of it.)So now to hypotheses. Perhaps people behave badly because --They don't see how their behavior affects other people.They haven't internalized the norms defining appropriate behavior in public.They reason that the norms don't apply to them in these circumstances.They overvalue their own importance in a social setting. \"My needs are more important than yours.\"They think \"I deserve this -- I've worked for it and these other people can take it or leave it.\"What these hypotheses amount to is either a failure to recognize the nature of one's behavior in the circumstances, a failure to have adequately internalized the relevant social norms of behavior, an inability to recognize the legitimate and normal wants of others, or combinations of all these.This subject is relevant to \"understandingsociety\" because it fundamentally has to do with social behavior, norms, and the cognitive-practical frameworks through which people generate their actions.  In order to understand this behavior we need to know how people understand their own presence within a social setting. We need to know how they construct an ongoing representation along these lines \"What's going on here? What's my role in this social encounter? What's expected of me? How much entitlement do I have to shape the encounter, versus the others present?\"  And we need to know how important conformance to local norms is to them. The oilman talking too loudly in the dining room at the Paris Ritz-Carlton may not know that local standards call for more decorous conversation, he may be thinking he's in his own private club back in Houston -- or he may just not care about the standards and the peace and quiet of the other guests.Seen properly, then, this is an occasion for verstehen -- interpretation of the puzzling actions of others in terms of an extended hypothesis about the states of mind and motive from which the action emanated and \"makes sense\". And there is a lot of social cognition -- or failures of cognition -- that goes into bad behavior."}, {"title": "China's many revolutions", "date": "Monday, July 28, 2008", "text": "It is worth reflecting a bit on how absolutely tumultuous China's history has been since the Communist Revolution in 1949. The Great Leap Forward and consequent famine -- 1958-60, in excess of 20 million famine deaths. The Cultural Revolution -- 1966-1976, in excess of 1.5 million deaths by violence, many times that number of maimed and ruined lives. The Democracy movement and Tiananmen Square and its dramatic suppression -- 1989, unknown thousands of victims. And since the early 1980s, economic reforms, rapid growth, and a substantial degree of social transformation.If you consider these events in terms of age cohorts, the historical experience of almost every generation has been a traumatic one. Chinese men and women born in 1930 were teenagers during the Revolution and experienced famine, chaos, civil violence, and economic reform in the remainder of their lives. The generation born in 1950 experienced the GLF famine as children, they were the teen-aged militants in middle school who formed the Red Guards, they experienced years of rustication in the countryside in the 1970s, they returned to universities after the end of the Cultural Revolution in 1976, they participated in or observed the tumult of Tiananmen Square as they approached their forties, and they participated in China's economic reforms in their forties and fifties. This is my own age cohort in the United States, and I am just amazed to consider the rapidity and depth of history this generation has lived through.The children of the 1950 generation  were born in 1970. These children largely escaped the violence of the Cultural Revolution. Tiananmen Square was a reality for them in their teens. Their generation has been at the center of the dynamism of entrepreneurial China, with broadened opportunities in education and business. They have some of the expertise and comfort with the Internet that allows them to bridge to the China if the twenty-first century. And their standard of living -- for urban people anyway -- is dramatically improved over that of the previous generation.And of course the generation of 1990 is the youth generation of today. This is the generation that will set China's course for the next half century, and it appears to be quite different from previous cohorts.  In a conversation with four graduate students at Tsinghua University I gained a very vivid sense of the generational change that is occurring today. Three were born in 1980 and one was born five years later. I asked them about some of the values and cultural expectations of young Chinese people.  The three older students laughed and said, \"we don't understand him at all! Even the music he likes makes no sense to us.\"These generations surely created vastly different mentalities for themselves -- different ideas about politics, equality, morality, and social stability. The ideologies of each generation were shaped and burned by the super-heated political struggles through which they passed. And surely their thoughts about what China should become, what standards of fairness should be respected, and how they should live their lives, are very deeply affected by their generational experiences."}, {"title": "Rising income inequality in China", "date": "Friday, July 25, 2008", "text": "Allan Wheatley writes an important article in Reuters this week about the situation of rising income inequalities in China as part and parcel of the booming economic growth the country has witness for the past two decades. \u00a0Several key facts emerge from the piece: While spectacular affluence is emerging at the top end of China's economic hierarchy, 204 million people lived on less than $1.25 per day in 2005. \u00a0China's Gini coefficient of income inequality rose from 40.7 in 1993 to 47.4 in 2004, according to an Asian Development Bank report -- a remarkably steep and rapid rise. \u00a0 (This compares to a Gini coefficient of income inequality in India of only 36.2.) \u00a0And inequalities of income between urban and rural people continue to rise. \u00a0Wheatley indicates that some experts believe that this phenomenon is the result of both rapid economic growth and a set of policies by the Chinese government that favor efficiency over equity. \u00a0And some experts believe that these rising inequalities are a significant source of risk for social stability in future decades.Wheatley bases most of his article on the recent work of the World Bank's chief economist, Justin Yifu Lin, formerly a leading professor at Peking University. \u00a0Lin and colleagues have published a collection of papers titled\u00a0China's Dilemma, which attempts to identify the economic policies that have resulted in this sustained rise in income inequality. \u00a0(The volume was co-published by Australian National University and Asian Pacific Press and the table of contents is available online.) \u00a0As Wheatley summarizes the findings, the Chinese government's policies concerning economic growth have favored \"efficiency\" and corporations over \"equity\" and workers. \u00a0And Lin argues that state policies actually protect and subsidize corporations, resulting in a massive transfer of wealth and income to the most affluent.All of this suggests to me the importance of returning to some of the important discussions of poverty and growth that were so dynamic in the 1970s. \u00a0Development theorists such as Hollis Chenery (Redistribution with Growth) and Irma Adelman (Economic growth and social equity in developing countries) gave careful analysis to the institutional context of economic growth, and put forward a strong argument for the idea that poverty alleviation needs to be built into the growth strategy from the beginning. \u00a0Both focused their attention on the institutions through which income is generated -- largely property holdings in land for peasants -- and argued that redistribution of property entitlements needed to be a structural feature of equitable economic growth. \u00a0It was neglect, not factual or policy weakness, that led to the eclipsing of this line of thought in development circles and World Bank thinking. \u00a0The Washington Consensus essentially put aside the idea that there are alternative pathways of economic growth, some of which are more favorable to equity than others.China's current theory of economic development seems closer to neo-liberal orthodoxy than it does to a progressive \"poor-first\" policy mix that would have the most sustained impact on China's poor.(There is more discussion of the poverty-first approach to development thinking in an unpublished paper on my research site, Putting the Poor First.)"}, {"title": "Action and its causes", "date": "Wednesday, July 23, 2008", "text": "What is an action? And, eventually, what role does action play in history?There is a large philosophical arena that focuses on the first part of this question. And basically, it comes down to \"persons intervening intentionally\".  Persons commit actions.  Persons have beliefs, desires, intentions, plans, and goals; they have reasons for what they do; they have emotions and aversions; they have habits.  Persons also have freedom: they have the ability to choose to act or not to act, in typical circumstances.These components all support the idea of the agent as a conscious, intentional intervener: the agent intervenes in the world in some way, in order to bring about an outcome that he/she desires or intends, based on her beliefs about the causal relationships that exist between the intervention and the outcome.  Purpose, beliefs, freedom to choose, and selected intervention fit together as an integrated ideal type of \"action\".This construction fits together into the Aristotelian idea of purposive action, or rational-intentional action. \u00a0But consider a few variations of individual behavior that seem to cut in a different direction: behavior following a script, reflexive or instinctive behavior, impulsive behavior, self-destructive behavior, self-deceptive behavior, possessed behavior, coerced behavior. \u00a0In each instance we lose an element that plays a key role in the purposive/intentional description of action above: self-direction, intentionality, self-control, rational goals and purposes, and freedom.  We might take these instances to describe cases of behavior that fall short of \"action\"; or we might hold that there is a range of degrees of intentionality associated with action, from fully free and deliberative choice to programmed or impulsive behaviors.So the traditional rational-intentional theory of action remains a partial view. \u00a0In addition to rational-intentional action and its variants, we can think of a range of other varieties that have little in common with this goal-directed model: expressive action, role-driven action, dramaturgical action, emotional action, .... \u00a0(I believe that Bourdieu's conception of habitus falls in this general domain.) \u00a0Here we have a number of paradigms of action that we can observe in everyday life, that provide an intelligible understanding of \"what is she doing, and why?\", and that appear to have a fundamentally different structure from the rational-intentional model. These actions express or enact rather than aim; or if they have an aim, it is to create a certain effect in the viewer.We thus need to broaden the definition of action. \u00a0We might say more generally that \"action\" is a particular construction of \"behavior\" -- it is an event of individual behavior that derives from a person's mentality (as opposed to a conditioned response, a reflex, or a Manchurian candidate device). \u00a0But the facts about mentality that can underlie an action are diverse: purposes, goals, allegiances, passions, features of identity, a sense of history, and aspects of role self-ascription, for example.Now turn to the question of interpretation. \u00a0The wide range of possible mental contexts of behavior means that the task of interpretation is a challenging one. \u00a0The intellectual task of interpretation is to arrive at an understanding of the agent's behavior as action. \u00a0This means arriving at a theory or construction attributing mental states to the actor that come together in such a way as to produce the action that was performed. \u00a0Perhaps we might interpret Richard Nixon's final year in office as the resultant of several distinct mental activities and states: self-deception, rational calculation, an emotional unwillingness to be defeated, and a degree of weakness of the will. \u00a0Or consider Emmanuel Le Roy Ladurie's interpretation of the actions of dozens of people in a massacre in Romans in 1580 in\u00a0Le Carnaval De Romans De La Chandeleur.\u00a0The actions seem prima facie incomprehensible; so the historian's task is to arrive at an interpretation of the beliefs, impulses, group dynamics, and practices that existed at the time in the context of which the actions \"make sense.\"  (See Paul Ricoeur and John Thompson's\u00a0Hermeneutics and the Human Sciences: Essays on Language, Action and Interpretation.)If we take the view that social outcomes are ultimately the result of the actions of individuals, then we plainly need to have a more nuanced and satisfactory framework of analysis within which to understand \"action\". \u00a0Rational-choice theory is one such framework; Aristotelian theory of deliberation is a somewhat broader framework. \u00a0But it is plain that the origins, motives, dynamics, and meanings of individual actions are broader and more heterogeneous than these rational-intentional theories would suggest. \u00a0Purposive action is an important part of the story of social action -- but it is only a part."}, {"title": "Literary tradition and social identity", "date": "Sunday, July 20, 2008", "text": "Literary traditions are sometimes thought to have an underlying interconnectedness and coherence that makes them more than simply a group of works sharing geography or group.  Irish poetry and drama, for example, extend over several centuries, involving writers with a range of voices and preoccupations; and yet it is often thought that they are distinctively \"Irish.\"  How should we conceptualize this notion?  And how does it relate to the concept of a social identity?One might speculate that the continuity of a literary tradition derives from two social factors:  first, that authors directly and indirectly respond to the writings of other authors in their tradition; and second, that writers express themes in their work that derive from a cultural tradition that they hold in common with other writers in this literary tradition.  If, for example, there is a long oral tradition of popular songs and poetry  that would have been a formative part of most Irish writers' experience as children, then it would be understandable if the cadences and phrases of this oral tradition infused their literary writings.  If there are historical moments in the history of the Irish people -- Easter 1916, perhaps -- that are focal points for cultural meanings and historical turning points for ordinary Irish people -- then, once again, we might expect that themes surrounding these historical moments will recur in the production of Irish literature.  And, of course, once a Goldsmith, Joyce, Yeats, or Heaney has created his poetry -- this constitutes an exemplar within the literary tradition itself that influences other Irish writers.So there are a couple of social mechanisms that we can cite as providing \"microfoundations\" for the production of a national literary tradition.  However, there are dimensions of variation and dissent that make the idea of a coherent and guiding literary tradition more difficult to sustain.  It is recognized within most literary traditions that there are different streams of influence, with diverging literary styles and presentations.  It is also recognized at a point in time that some great writers offer a literature that is strikingly at odds with the tradition from which they emerge.  And it must also be recognized that large literary traditions -- the literature of India, American literature, Caribbean literature -- represent the confluence of different voices and different cultural experiences.   And often these voices are deeply at odds with each other and with the dominant social order -- Jack London's novels represent a very different perspective on the United States than those of Henry James.Within the literature of the United States -- what is often called \"American literature\" in US college English courses -- we can find a diversity of influences at almost every level of scale: the New England novel, African-American songs and stories, women's novels and journals, ... And within each we can discern important variations with cross-cutting influences -- the African-American voice of the deep south is evidently different from that of Chicago or Harlem or Los Angeles.So we would certainly want to recognize that great writers are more than simply an expression of their literary or social tradition; rather, they find their voice and perspective through a dense interaction with culture, history, daily experience, race, gender, poetry, song, and dozens of other influences.  And their products are often both innovative and \"traditional\".  The novels of James Baldwin capture and embody many aspects of African-American experience and literature; they in turn contribute to the meaning of African-American literature post-Baldwin; but in the end they transcend the framework of a fixed formula.  Baldwin's novels are original and particular -- not simply an expression of \"the African-American tradition.\"So from this point of view it seems that the idea of a literary tradition recedes from the metaphor of a compact, tightly bunched set of texts, to a meandering confluence of many cultural traditions and voices.  This suggests that we need a metaphor that captures the diversity of voice and influence better than the idea of a river or stream.This set of questions is relevant to the idea of a social identity as well.  First is the obvious connection: if there is such a thing as \"Irish social identity,\" it is plausible that this identity plays into the production of Irish literature.  But the points raised here about diversity of experience and the non-reducibility of one writer's literature to a formula are also valid when we consider ascriptions of social identities.  Rather than imagining that a person embodies the social identity of her own group, we should recognize that each person's social identity is a complicated mix of influences and commitments.  Rather than \"Sally is catholic\", we might be better to observe that: \"Sally is a mid-western Catholic with a feminist bent and a taste for punk music.\"This suggests to me that we encounter in both traditions and identities, a kind of social construct that in a sense disappears as we increase the resolution of study; through closer study we come to see the variations as much as the commonalities within a group of people or a group of texts.  Does this imply that identities and traditions do not exist?  It does not.  Both function as real social causes and influences.  But both need to be understood as fluid, heterogeneous compounds rather than as essential, abiding realities."}, {"title": "Intellectual leaders", "date": "Friday, July 18, 2008", "text": "In 2005 the Nouvel Observateur published a special issue devoted to \"25 grands penseurs du monde entier\" -- 25 great global thinkers.

The collection as a whole is a great antidote to the various forms of parochialism to which the intellectual world is prone -- national assumptions, disciplinary assumptions, north-south assumptions.  These thinkers are original, innovative, and usually boundary-crossing.  And they are most frequently concerned with issues that are front and center in the task of understanding and improving the global world we collectively inhabit.There are quite a few cross-cutting themes that recur across various groups of these thinkers.  (It would be a very interesting exercise to \"tag\" each of these thinkers with a handful of topics and then map the relationships among them.)   And certainly this is true: we will collectively do a better job of understanding and improving our global world, if we find ways of engaging with the thinking, issues, and frameworks of observers throughout the world.  Sociology and philosophy both require new ideas -- and a deep and sustained international conversation can be a source of ideas and corrections to old ideas.It is very interesting to take stock of the ways that the Internet can now facilitate these international conversations.  YouTube is a good example; mixed among the millions of videos of pets and birthday parties are invaluable snippets of insight from the world's most innovative thinkers.  Certainly it would be possible to conduct a transformative advanced seminar in social theory -- perhaps online! -- based on materials and videos available on YouTube.  But it is interesting as well what we can't yet find on YouTube: selections from intellectuals and theorists from the developing world.  It is substantially more difficult to locate web-based resources documenting the thinking of intellectuals from Africa, Latin America, or China.Here are some YouTube resources on several of the thinkers included in the Nouvel Obs list.

Industrial factories, chemical and nuclear plants, farms, mines, and aviation all represent sectors where safety issues are critically important because of the inherent risks of the processes they involve.   However, \"safety\" is not primarily a technological characteristic; instead, it is an aggregate outcome that depends as much on the social organization and management of the processes involved as it does on the technologies they employ.  (See an earlier posting on technology failure.)We can define safety by relating it to the concept of \"harmful incident\".  A harmful incident is an occurrence that leads to injury or death of one or more persons. Safety is a relative concept, in that it involves analysis and comparison of the frequencies of harmful incidents relative to some measure of the volume of activity. If the claim is made that interstate highways are safer than county roads, this amounts to the assertion that there are fewer accidents per vehicle-mile on the former than the latter. If it is held that commercial aviation is safer than automobile transportation, this amounts to the claim that there are fewer harms per passenger-mile in air travel than auto travel. And if it is observed that the computer assembly industry is safer than the mining industry, this can be understood to mean that there are fewer harms per person-day in the one sector than the other. (We might give a parallel analysis of the concept of a healthy workplace.)This analysis highlights two dimensions of industrial safety: the inherent capacity for creating harms associated with the technology and processes in use (heavy machinery, blasting, and uncertain tunnel stability in mining, in contrast to a computer and a red pencil on the editorial offices of a newspaper), and the processes and systems that are in place to guard against harm. The first set of factors is roughly \"technological,\" while the second set is social and organizational.Variations in safety records across industries and across sites within a given industry provide an excellent tool for analyzing the effects of various institutional arrangements.  It is often possible to pinpoint a crucial difference in organization -- supervision, training, internal procedures, inspection protocols, etc. -- that can account for a high accident rate in one factory and a low rate in an otherwise similar factory in a different state.One of the most important findings of safety engineering is that organization and culture play critical roles in enhancing the safety characteristics of a given activity -- that is to say, safety is strongly influenced by social factors that define and organize the behaviors of workers, users, or managers. (See Charles Perrow, Normal Accidents: Living with High-Risk Technologies and Nancy Leveson, Safeware: System Safety and Computers, for a couple of excellent treatments of the sociological dimensions of safety.)This isn't to say that only social factors can influence safety performance within an activity or industry. In fact, a central effort by safety engineers involves modifying the technology or process so as to remove the source of harm completely -- what we might call \"passive\" safety.  So, for example, if it is possible to design a nuclear reactor in such a way that a loss of coolant leads automatically to shutdown of the fission reaction, then we have designed out of the system the possibility of catastrophic meltdown and escape of radioactive material. This might be called \"design for soft landings\".However, most safety experts agree that the social and organizational characteristics of the dangerous activity are the most common causes of bad safety performance. Poor supervision and inspection of maintenance operations leads to mechanical failures, potentially harming workers or the public. A workplace culture that discourages disclosure of unsafe conditions makes the likelihood of accidental harm much greater. A communications system that permits ambiguous or unclear messages to occur can lead to air crashes and wrong-site surgeries.This brings us at last to the point of this posting: the observation that safety data in a variety of industries and locations permit us to probe organizational features and their effects with quite a bit of precision.  This is a place where institutions and organizations make a big difference in observable outcomes; safety is a consequence of a specific combination of technology, behaviors, and organizational practices.  This is a good opportunity for combining comparative and statistical research methods in support of causal inquiry, and it invites us to probe for the social mechanisms that underlie the patterns of high or low safety performance that we discover.Consider one example.  Suppose we are interested in discovering some of the determinants of safety records in deep mining operations. We might approach the question from several points of view.We might select five mines with \"best in class\" safety records and compare them in detail with five \"worst in class\" mines. Are there organizational or techology features that distinguish the cases?We might do the large-N version of this study: examine a sample of mines from \"best in class\" and \"worst in class\" and test whether there are observed features that explain the differences in safety records. (For example, we may find that 75% of the former group but only 10% of the latter group are subject to frequent unannounced safety inspection. This supports the notion that inspections enhance safety.)We might compare national records for mine safety--say, Poland and Britain. We might then attempt to identify the general characteristics that describe mines in the two countries and attempt to explain observed differences in safety records on the basis of these characteristics. Possible candidates might include degree of regulatory authority, capital investment per mine, workers per mine, ...We might form a hypothesis about a factor that should be expected to enhance safety -- a company-endorsed safety education program, let's say -- and then randomly assign a group of mines to \"treated\" and \"untreated\" groups and compare safety records.  (This is a quasi-experiment; see an earlier posting for a discussion of this mode of reasoning.) If we find that the treated group differs significantly in average safety performance, this supports the claim that the treatment is causally relevant to the safety outcome.Investigations along these lines can establish an empirical basis for judging that one or more organizational features A, B, C have consequences for safety performance.  In order to be confident in these judgments, however, we need to supplement the empirical analysis with a theory of the mechanisms through which features like A, B, C influence behavior in such a way as to make accidents more or less likely.Safety, then, seems to be a good area of investigation for researchers within the general framework of the new institutionalism, because the effects of institutional and organizational differences emerge as observable differences in the rates of accidents in comparable industrial settings.

These organizations all have missions, personnel, constituencies, and policies and practices. They all do various things -- they affect individuals in society and they bring about significant social effects. And, in each case there are at least three aspects of their realities -- the ways they publicly present themselves, the ways their behaviors and effects are perceived by the public, and the usually unobservable reality of how they actually behave. Usually the public persona of the institution is benign, fair, and public- spirited. But how close is this public persona to the truth? In many of our basic institutions, the answer seems to be, not very.  We are daily confronted with cases of official corruption, corporations that abuse their power, legislators who take advantage of insider status, and the like.  So how can we conceptualize the task of getting a reasonably accurate perception of the hidden workings of our major institutions and organizations?First, let's consider whether it is possible to specify a minimum charter of good organizational behavior in a democratic society.  This would be a partial answer to a part of our question: what defines the conditions of a socially acceptable and publicly defensible organization?  Consider these aspirations --The organization should have goals that are compatible with enhancing the public good.The organization should have appropriate policies about behavior towards employees and the public.The organization should genuinely incorporate a commitment of compliance to law and regulation.The corporation should embody a faithful commitment to exerting its efforts on behalf of its stated mission and stakeholders.The organization should be committed to transparency and accountability. Bad business practices and corruption can often be traced to a violation of one or more of these principles. The most offensive practices by powerful organizations -- predatory behavior, asset stripping, the use of coercion and threat to achieve organizational goals, fraud, deception, illegal behavior, toxic waste dumping, evasion of regulations, and bribery -- all fall within the categories identified here.So how are we to determine whether our existing organizations and institutions satisfy these minimal conditions?  We might imagine a routine \"scan\" of major institutions and organizations that asks a small set of questions along these lines:What are the real operational goals and priorities of the organization?What are the operational policies that govern corporate action?How do agents of the organization actually treat members of the public in carrying out their tasks?To what extent are there discrepancies between policy and practice?To what extent do powerful leaders and managers use their positions to favor their own private interests? (conflict of interest)To what extent do business crimes occur -- accounting fraud, investor deception, evasion of regulations for health and safety?And, most generally, to what extent is there a discrepancy between the official story about the organization and its actual practices?It is very easy to think of examples of bad organizational behavior illustrating each of these questions -- waste management companies fronting for organized crime groups, pharmaceutical companies producing defective generic drugs, police officers accepting bribes from speeding drivers, mining companies hiring \"security workers\" to evict \"squatters.\" And it would be a very interesting exercise to try to provide brief but accurate answers to each of these questions for a number of organizations.  Based on the answers to questions like these that we are able to establish, we could then make an effort to answer the question of how great a discrepancy there is between the benign public persona of major institutions and their actual workings.In theory we might say that answering these questions is no more difficult than putting a man on the moon -- costly but straightforward. However, as was said twenty years ago in the context of anti-ballistic missile technology, the difference is that the moon doesn't fight back. Organizations -- particularly large governmental and corporate organizations -- are very adept at covering their tracks, concealing bad behavior, and re-telling the story in their own interests. So the investigative challenge is a huge one -- we might speculate that corruption multiplies geometrically, while investigative capacity multiplies arithmetically (a sort of Malthusian theory of misbehavior).  Any given abuse can be uncovered in the New Yorker or on the 6 o'clock news -- but bad behavior outstrips investigative resources.So the task of understanding this aspect of modern society amounts to finding effective ways of shining a light on the real practices and priorities of important organizations and institutions. And the practical interest we have in controlling bad organizations -- controlling corruption, ensuring good environmental and labor practices, eliminating coercion and violence -- comes down to the challenge of enhancing the ability of democracies to investigate, regulate, and publicize the standards and outcomes of behavior that are required.(Earlier posts have addressed aspects of this issue, including comments on corruption and publicity.)"}, {"title": "Discipline, method, hegemony in sociology", "date": "Tuesday, July 8, 2008", "text": "An earlier post referred to the \"Perestroika\" debate within political science. There are similar foundational debates within other social science disciplines, including especially sociology.  What is particularly striking is not that there are deep disagreements about the methodology and epistemology of sociology -- this has often been true within sociology, going back to the methodenstreiten that divided the German-speaking social sciences around the turn of the twentieth century, but rather the degree to which these disagreements have been so divisive and polarizing within the discipline in the U.S. in the past forty years.Several interesting books that focus on some of these debates within sociology include George Steinmetz, The Politics of Method in the Human Sciences: Positivism and Its Epistemological Others; Immanuel Wallerstein, The End of the World As We Know It: Social Science for the Twenty-First Century; Craig Calhoun, Sociology in America: A History; and Alvin Gouldner, The Coming Crisis of Western Sociology.   Andrew Abbott's Chaos of Disciplines is also a very interesting treatment of the sociology of the social science disciplines and the mechanisms through which a discipline defines its boundaries and maintains \"discipline\".In sociology it is possible to map the main fault lines within the discipline in several ways.  First, we can distinguish quantitative-statistical research from both qualitative-ethnographic approaches and comparative-historical approaches.  (It's worth observing that this results in a tripartite division of methods rather than the simpler bipolar \"quantitative-qualitative\" divide. Historical and comparative studies are distinct from statistical studies, but they are also distinguishable from ethnographic interpretations.)  Or we can characterize this space in terms of \"large-N, small-N, single-N\" studies. And we can distinguish broadly among positivist and anti-positivist perspectives; causal and interpretive perspectives; realist and anti-realist perspectives; critical and orthodox perspectives; and there are probably other important dimensions of  disagreement as well.   In addition to these large divisions among methodological approaches, there are also a large number of frameworks of thought that involve a combination of method and theory -- for example, feminist sociology, post-structuralist sociology, critical theory, and post-colonial sociology.The disputes between these methodological frameworks seem to continue to create large, fractious divides within graduate sociology departments, with advocates for one method or the other claiming virtually exclusive legitimacy. And this struggle for methodological primacy appears to extend to the editorial policies of major sociology journals, association programs, and tenure deliberations.  Until fairly recently -- the 1990s, let us say -- the quantitative-statistical faction held sway as the hegemonic methodological doctrine. Inspired by positivism and the example of the natural sciences and perhaps guided by governmental and foundation funding priorities, quantitative studies were considered most scientific, most rigorous, most objective, and most explanatory. Historical and interpretive studies were treated as \"ideographic\" or anecdotal -- not well suited to discovering important social regularities.  And yet it seems apparent that many problems of sociological interest are not amenable to quantitative or statistical research.Let's consider for a moment how these issues ought to work -- how method, theory, and the world ought to be related. In any area of science there is a range of phenomena that we want to understand. So we need to have tools for investigating the real, empirical characteristics of this stuff, and we aim to arrive at theories that explain the more interesting features of this domain of real phenomena. Finally, we need some intellectual resources on the basis of which to arrive at the desired knowledge -- we need some methods of inquiry, some models of theory, and some ideas about the underlying ontology of the phenomena we are studying. So the world exists; we want to gain knowledge and understanding of this world; and we need some tools for investigating and theorizing this world.But here is the key point: the central focus here is knowledge, not method. Method is a tool for helping us to arrive at knowledge. For any given empirical question there will be a variety of methods on the basis of which to investigate this problem. And ideally, we should select a set of tools that are well suited to the particular characteristics of the problem at hand.In other words, analysis of the situation of knowledge producers would suggest methodological pluralism. We should be open to a variety of tools and methods, and should design research in a way that is closely tailored to the nature of the empirical problem.  And therefore young sociologists -- graduate students -- should be encouraged to be eclectic in their reading and thinking; they should be exposed to many of the approaches, perspectives, and methods through which imaginative sociologists have addressed their problems of research and explanation.This general recommendation in favor of pluralism in sociology is strengthened when we consider the fact of the inherent heterogeneity of the social world.  (See an earlier posting on this subject.)  There is not one single kind of social process, for which there might conceivably be a uniquely best kind of method of inquiry. Rather, the social world consists of a deeply heterogeneous mix of processes, some of which are better suited to an ethnographic or comparative approach, just as other processes may be best studied quantitatively.  If one is interested in the topic of corruption, for example -- he/she will need to be informed about institutions, culture, principal-agent problems, social psychology, and many other potentially relevant sociological factors.  And these researches may well require a combination of statistical analysis, comparison across a select group of cases, and ethnographic investigation in a small number of specific cases and individuals.In other words, there are very deep arguments supporting the value and epistemic suitability of methodological pluralism. And this in turn suggests that sociology departments are well advised to incorporate a variety of methods and frameworks into their doctoral programs.Fortunately, it appears that this rethinking is now taking place in a number of top sociology departments in the U.S., and  the formerly hegemonic position of quantitative methods is now being challenged by a more pluralistic treatment of methods and frameworks.  And this is all to the good: the result will be a better sociology and a better understanding of the heterogeneous, novel, and rapidly changing world in which we find ourselves."}, {"title": "\"Moral economy\" as a historical social concept", "date": "Monday, July 7, 2008", "text": "The concept of a \"moral economy\" has proved useful in attempting to describe and explain the contentious behavior of peasants in response to onerous social relations. Essentially, it is the idea that peasant communities share a set of normative attitudes concerning the social relations and social behaviors that surround the local economy: the availability of food, the prices of subsistence commodities, the proper administration of taxation, and the operation of charity, for example.  This is sometimes referred to a \"subsistence ethic\": the idea that local social arrangements should be structured in such a way as to respect the subsistence needs of the rural poor.  The associated theory of political behavior holds something like this: peasant communities are aroused to protest and rebellion when the terms of the local subsistence ethic are breached by local elites, state authorities, or market forces.Here I want to highlight this concept by asking a few foundational questions.  Fundamentally, what kind of concept is it?  How does it function in social interpretation, description, or explanation?  And how does it function as a component of empirical investigation?The concept of moral economy was extensively developed by E. P. Thompson in  The Making of the English Working Class (1961) and an important essay, \"The Moral Economy of the English Crowd in the Eighteenth Century,\" originally published in Past and Present in 1971 and included in Customs in Common: Studies in Traditional Popular Culture.  The concept derives from Thompson's treatment of bread riots in eighteenth century Britain. In MEWC Thompson writes:In 18th-century Britain riotous actions assumed two different forms: that of more or less spontaneous popular direct action; and that of the deliberate use of the crowd as an instrument of pressure, by persons \"above\" or apart from he crowd.  The first form has not received the attention which it merits. It rested upon more articulate popular sanctions and was validated by more sophisticated traditions than the word \"riot\" suggests.  The most common example is the bread or food riot, repeated cases of which can be found in almost every town and county until the 1840s. This was rarely a mere uproar which culminated in the breaking open of barns or the looting of shops.  It was legitimised by the assumptions of an older moral economy, which taught the immorality of any unfair method of forcing up the price of provisions by profiteering upon the necessities of the people. (MTWEC, 62-63)After describing a number of bread riots in some detail, Thompson writes, \"Actions on such a scale ... indicate an extraordinarily deep-rooted pattern of behaviour and belief ....  These popular actions were legitimised by the old paternalist moral economy\" (66).  And he closes this interesting discussion with these words: \"In considering only this one form of 'mob' action we have come upon unsuspected complexities, for behind every such form of popular direct action some legitimising notion of right is to be found\" (68). And Thompson often describes these values as \"traditional\" or \"paternalist\" -- working in opposition to the values and ideas of an unfettered market; he contrasts \"moral economy\" with the modern \"political economy\" associated with liberalism and the ideology of the free market.In \"The Moral Economy of the Crowd\" Thompson puts his theory this way:It is possible to detect in almost ever eighteenth-century crowd action some legitimising notion. By the notion of legitimation I mean that the men and women in the crowd were informed by the belief that they were defending traditional rights or customs; and, in general, that they were supported by the wider consensus of the community. On occasion this popular consensus was endorsed by some measure of licence afforded by the authorities. More commonly, the consensus was so strong that it overrode motives of fear or deference. (\"Moral Economy,\" CIC 188)It is plain from these passages that Thompson believes that the \"moral economy\" is a real historical factor, consisting of the complex set of attitudes and norms of justice that are in play within  this historically presented social group.   As he puts the point late in the essay, \"We have been examining a pattern of social protest which derives from a consensus as to the moral economy of the commonweal in times of dearth\" (247).So the logic of Thompson's ideas here seems fairly clear: there were instances of public disorder (\"riots\") surrounding the availability and price of food, and there is a hypothesized \"notion of right\" or justice that influenced and motivated participants.  This conception of justice is a socially embodied historical factor, and it partially explains the behavior of the rural people who mobilized themselves to participate in the disturbances.  He recapitulates his goal in the essay, \"Moral Economy Reviewed\" (also included in Customs in Common) in these terms: \"My object of analysis was the mentalit\u00e9, or, as I would prefer, the political culture, the expectations, traditions, and indeed, superstitions of the working population most frequently involved in actions in the market\" (260).  These shared values and norms play a key role in Thompson's reading of the political behavior of the individuals in these groups. So these hypotheses about the moral economy of the crowd serve both to help interpret the actions of a set of actors involved in food riots, and to explain the timing and nature of food riots.  We might say, then, that the concept of \"moral economy\" contributes both to a hermeneutics of peasant behavior and a causal theory of peasant contention.Now move forward two centuries.  Another key use of the concept of moral economy occurs in treatments of modern peasant rebellions in Asia.  Most influential is James Scott's important book, The Moral Economy of the Peasant: Rebellion and Subsistence in Southeast Asia. Scholars of the Chinese Revolution borrowed from Scott in offering a range of interpretations of peasant behavior in the context of CCP mobilization; for example, James Polachek (\"The Moral Economy of the Kiangsi Soviet\" (1928-34). Journal of Asian Studies 1983 XLII (4):805-830).  And most recently, Kevin O'Brien has made use of the idea of a moral economy in his treatment of \"righteous protest\" in contemporary China (Rightful Resistance in Rural China).  So scholars interested in the politics of Asian rural societies have found the moral economy concept to be a useful one.  Scott puts his central perspective in these terms:We can learn a great deal from rebels who were defeated nearly a half-century ago.  If we understand the indignation and rage which prompted them to risk everything, we can grasp what I have chosen to call their moral economy: their notion of economic justice and their working definition of exploitation--their view of which claims on their product were tolerable and which intolerable.  Insofar as their moral economy is representative of peasants elsewhere, and I believe I can show that it is, we may move toward a fuller appreciation of the normative roots of peasant politics.  If we understand, further, how the central economic and political transformations of the colonial era served to systematically violate the peasantry's vision of social equity, we may realize how a class \"of low classness\" came to provide, far more often than the proletariat, the shock troops of rebellion and revolution. (MEP, 3-4)Scott's book represents his effort to understand the dynamic material circumstances of peasant life in colonial Southeast Asia (Vietnam and Burma); to postulate some central normative assumptions of the \"subsistence ethic\" that he believes characterizes these peasant societies; and then to explain the variations in political behavior of peasants in these societies based on the moments of inconsistency between material conditions and aspects of the subsistence ethic.   And he postulates that the political choices for action these peasant rebels make are powerfully influenced by the content of the subsistence ethic.  Essentially, we are invited to conceive of the \"agency\" of the peasant as being a complicated affair, including prudential reasoning, moral assessment based on shared standards of justice, and perhaps other factors as well.  So, most fundamentally, Scott's theory offers an account of the social psychology and agency of peasants.There are several distinctive features of Scott's programme.  One is his critique of narrow agent-centered theories of political motivation, including particularly rational choice theory.  (Samuel Popkin's The Rational Peasant: The Political Economy of Rural Society in Vietnam is the prime example.)  Against the idea that peasants are economically rational agents who decide about political participation based on a narrowly defined cost-benefit analysis, Scott argues for a more complex political psychology incorporating socially shared norms and values.  But a second important feature is Scott's goal of providing a somewhat general basis for explanation of peasant behavior.  He wants to argue that the subsistence ethic is a widely shared set of moral values in traditional rural societies -- with the consequence that it provides a basis for explanation that goes beyond the particulars of Vietnam or Burma.  And he has a putative explanation of this commonality as well -- the common existential circumstances of traditional family-based agriculture.One could pull several of these features apart in Scott's treatment.  For example, we could accept the political psychology -- \"People are motivated by a locally embodied sense of justice\" -- but could reject the generalizability of the subsistence ethic -- \"Burmese peasants had the XYZ set of local values, while Vietnamese peasants possessed the UVW set of local values.\"This programme suggests several problems for theory and for empirical research.  Are there social-science research methods that would permit us to \"observe\" or empirically discern the particular contents of a normative worldview in a range of different societies, in order to assess whether the subsistence ethic that Scott describes is widespread?  Are peasants in Burma and Vietnam as similar as Scott's theory postulates?  How would we validate the implicit theory of political motivation that Scott advances (calculation within the context of normative judgment)?  Are there other important motivational factors that are perhaps as salient to political behavior as the factors invoked by the subsistence ethic?   Where does Scott's \"thicker\" description of peasant consciousness sit with respect to fully ethnographic investigation?So to answer my original question -- what kind of concept is the \"moral economy\"? -- we can say several things.  It is a proto-theory of the theory of justice that certain groups possess (18th-century English farmers and townspeople, 20th-century Vietnamese peasants).  It implicitly postulates a theory of political motivation and political agency.  It asserts a degree of generality across peasant societies.  It is offered as a basis for both interpreting and explaining events -- answering the question \"What is going on here?\" and \"Why did this event take place?\"  In these respects the concept is both an empirical construct and a framework for thinking about agency; so it can be considered both in terms of its specific empirical adequacy and, more broadly, the degree of insight it offers for thinking about collective action."}, {"title": "Heterogeneity of the social", "date": "Friday, July 4, 2008", "text": "I think heterogeneity is a very basic characteristic of the domain of the social. And I think this makes a big difference for how we should attempt to study the social world \"scientifically\". What sorts of things am I thinking about here?Let's start with some semantics. A heterogeneous group of things is the contrary of a homogeneous group, and we can define homogeneity as \"a group of fundamentally similar units or samples\".  A homogeneous body may consist of a group of units with identical properties, or it may be a smooth mixture of different things, consisting of a similar composition at many levels of scale. A fruitcake is non-homogeneous, in that distinct volumes may include just cake or a mix of cake and dried cherries, or cake and the occasional walnut. The properties of fruitcake depend on which sample we encounter. A well mixed volume of oil and vinegar, by contrast, is homogeneous in a specific sense: the properties of each sample volume are the same as any other.  The basic claim about the heterogeneity of the social comes down to this: at many levels of scale we continue to find a diversity of social things and processes at work. Society is more similar to fruitcake than cheesecake.Heterogeneity makes a difference because one of the central goals of positivist science is to discover strong regularities among classes of phenomena, and regularities appear to presuppose homogeneity of the things over which the regularities are thought to obtain. So to observe that social phenomena are deeply heterogeneous at many levels of scale, is to cast fundamental doubt on the goal of discovering strong social regularities.Let's consider some of the forms of heterogeneity that the social world illustrates.First is the heterogeneity of social causes and influences. Social events are commonly the result of a variety of different kinds of causes that come together in highly contingent conjunctions. A revolution may be caused by a protracted drought, a harsh system of land tenure, a new ideology of peasant solidarity, a communications system that conveys messages to the rural poor, and an unexpected spar within the rulers -- all coming together at a moment in time.  And this range of causal factors, in turn, shows up in the background of a very heterogeneous set of effects. (A transportation network, for example, may play a causal role in the occurrence of an epidemic, the spread of radical ideas, and a long, slow process of urban settlement.) The causes of an event are a mixed group of dissimilar influences with different dynamics and temporalities, and the effects of a given causal factor are also a mixed and dissimilar group.Second is the heterogeneity that can be discovered within social categories of things -- cities, religions, electoral democracies, social movements. Think of the diversity within Islam documented so well by Clifford Geertz (Islam Observed: Religious Development in Morocco and Indonesia); the diversity at multiple levels that exists among great cities like Beijing, New York, Geneva, and Rio (institutions, demography, ethnic groups, economic characteristics, administrative roles, ...); the institutional variety that exists in the electoral democracies of India, France, and Argentina; or the wild diversity across the social movements of the right.Third is the heterogeneity that can be discovered across and within social groups. It is not the case that all Kansans think alike -- and this is true for whatever descriptors we might choose in order to achieve greater homogeneity (evangelical Kansans, urban evangelical Kansans, ...). There are always interesting gradients within any social group.  Likewise, there is great variation in the nature of ordinary, lived experience -- for middle-class French families celebrating quatorze Juillet, for Californians celebrating July 4, and for Brazilians enjoying Dia da Independ\u00eancia on September 7.A fourth form of heterogeneity takes us within the agent herself, when we note the variety of motives, moral frameworks, emotions, and modes of agency on the basis of which people act. This is one of the weaknesses of doctrinaire rational choice theory or dogmatic Marxism, the analytical assumption of a single dimension of motivation and reasoning.  Instead, it is visible that one person acts for a variety of motives at a given time, persons shift their motives over time, and members of groups differ in terms of their motivational structure as well.  So there is heterogeneity of motives and agency within the agent.These dimensions of heterogeneity make the point: the social world is an ensemble, a dynamic mixture, and an ongoing interaction of forces, agents, structures, and mentalities. Social outcomes emerge from this heterogeneous and dynamic mixture, and the quest for general laws is deeply quixotic.Where does the heterogeneity principle take us? It suggests an explanatory strategy: instead of looking for laws of whole categories of events and things, rather than searching for simple answers to questions like \"why do revolutions occur?\", we might instead look to a \"concatenation\" strategy. That is, we might simply acknowledge the fact of molar heterogeneity and look instead for some of the different processes and things in play in a given item of interest, and the build up a theory of the whole as a concatenation of the particulars of the parts.Significantly, this strategy takes us to several fruitful ideas that already have some currency.First is the idea of looking for microfoundations for observed social processes; (Microfoundations, Methods, and Causation: On the Philosophy of the Social Sciences).  Here the idea is that higher-level social processes, causes, and events, need to be placed within the context of an account of the agent-level institutions and circumstances that convey those processes.Second is the method of causal mechanisms advocated by McAdam, Tarrow, and Tilly, and discussed frequently here (Dynamics of Contention (Cambridge Studies in Contentious Politics)).  Put simply, the approach recommends that we explain an outcome as the contingent result of the concatenation of a set of independent causal mechanisms (escalation, intra-group competition, repression, ...).And third is the theory of \"assemblages\", recommended by Nick from accursedshare and derived from some of the theories of Gilles Deleuze.  (Manuel Delanda describes this theory in A New Philosophy of Society: Assemblage Theory And Social Complexity.)Each of these ideas gives expression to the important truth of the heterogeneity principle: that social outcomes are the aggregate result of a number of lower-level processes and institutions that give rise to them, and that social outcomes are contingent results of interaction and concatenation of these lower-level processes."}, {"title": "Engels' sociology of the city", "date": "Thursday, July 3, 2008", "text": "Friedrich Engels' book, The Condition of the Working Class in England, was one of the earliest \"sociological\" descriptions of the emerging working class in industrial Europe.  Engels is a good subject for this blog, because this book is a very interesting effort to \"understand society\" at a time when the changes that Britain was undergoing were perplexing and rapid.  Like other nineteenth century thinkers -- such as Thomas Carlyle, Alexis de Tocqueville, or Alexander Herzen -- Engels was trying to find language, concepts, theories, and metaphors in terms of which to comprehend the rapid processes of urbanization and industrialization that he observed.  This is a place where the \"sociological imagination\" is most critical -- the ability of talented observers to begin to make sense of the complex social reality surrounding them, and to find language and theory adequate to expressing that reality.Published in German in 1845, Conditions represents Engels' attempt to offer a detailed and systematic description of the emerging industrial system in England, largely based on his experience as a young man in the textile firm of Ermen and Engels in Manchester.  (Steven Marcus's book, Engels, Manchester & the Working Class, provides a good description.) The book is one of the classics of radical thought in the nineteenth century, and substantiates Engels' stature as a thinker whose perceptions and critiques developed independently from Marx's, in his early years anyway.My question here is, what are some of the characteristics of this book as a work of social science?  To what extent does the book serve to provide one of the founding sources of modern sociology?  And, of course, we need to avoid  anachronism when we ask this question; the book was published  only two years later than John Stuart Mill's System of Logic (1843) -- one of the earliest efforts to frame an answer to the question of \"social science\", and the question of how best to understand the emerging world of industrial capitalism was a profoundly challenging one.The book has several key features.  First, Engels gives a great deal of effort to the task of observing and describing the facts of urban industrial life in the 1840s in Manchester and Birmingham.  He is interested in recording the conditions of life that workers experienced; the nature and cost of their daily subsistence; the conditions of health and safety that they experienced; and the nature and size of the population of the towns, neighborhoods, and cities that he describes.  Engels relies upon his own observations, but he also makes extensive use of the growing body of official reports that were being produced by English governmental agencies as well as travelers' reports, coroners' reports, and newspapers.  He refers especially to investigations by the health authorities following the cholera epidemic of 1831-32.Second, Engels does not attempt to assume the posture of a disinterested observer.  He is plainly on the side of the worker and a radical critic of the bourgeois owner; he is making a case about exploitation and indifference against the emerging class of owners whose factories he describes.Third, he is interested in resistance and mobilization, and he devotes chapters to strikes and other forms of organized efforts by workers and their families to improve their conditions.  This is especially true in Chapter IX (Working-Class Movements), but these topics recur in many places in the book.Fourth, quite a bit of the book might be classified as \"ethnography\" today: detailed, first-person description of conditions of life of a particular group of people, based on direct interaction with them by the observer.Fifth, the book certainly falls in the category of descriptive urban sociology.  Engels is very interested in describing living conditions, including crowding, squalor, and deprivation.  He offers detailed description of the state of the environment -- rivers, waterways, roads, and buildings -- in the cities he describes, including the famous River Irk in Manchester.  And there are numerous drawings of the layout of streets and neighborhoods, so that Engels can document his points about crowding and squalor.  Here is a quick description of a neighborhood in Manchester:Some four thousand people, mostly Irish, inhabit this slum. The cottages are very small, old and dirty, while the streets are uneven, partly unpaved, not properly drained and full of ruts.  Heaps of refuse, offal and sickening filth are everywhere interspersed with pools of stagnant liquid.  The atmosphere is polluted by the stench and is darkened by the thick smoke of a dozen factory chimneys.  ... The creatures who inhabit these dwellings and even their dark, wet cellars, and who live confined amidst all this filth and foul air -- which cannot be dissipated because of the surrounding lofty buildings -- must surely have sunk to the lowest leel of humanity. (71)The organization of the book reveals an effort by Engels to engage in sociological classification. For example, he distinguishes among several groups of proletarians: industrial workers, miners, farm laborers, and the Irish workers (chapter II).  Within industrial workers he further distinguishes workers by sector and division of labor.  And he believes that the classification is explanatory: \"the closer the wage earners are associated with industry the more advanced they are\".There are several large sociological processes that Engels articulates.  The book puts forward an account of the dynamics of class formation through the development of the industrial system -- the process of centralization and increase of scale of production leading to the consolidation of a class of owners and a large class of proletarians.  But the book also advances an analysis of urbanization and the growth of towns and cities, based on the dynamics of factory production and the need for larger volumes of labor.  \"Industry and commerce attain their highest stage of development in the big towns, so that it is here that the effects of industrialisation on the wage earners can be most clearly seen\" (28).  Consider his description of the slums of London:It is only when [the observer] has visited the slums of this great city that it dawns upon him that the inhabitants of modern London have had to sacrifice so much that is best in human nature in order to create those wonders of civilisation with which their city teems.  The vast majority of Londoners have had to let so many of their potential creative faculties lie dormant, stunted and unused in order that a small, closely-knit group of their fellow citizens could develop to the full the qualities with which nature has endowed them. (30)And consider his commentary on the effects that slum life has:In the circumstances it is to be expected that it is in this region that the inevitable consequences of industrialisation in so far as they affect the working classes are most strikingly evident.  Nowhere else can the life and conditions of the industrial proletariat be studied in all their aspects as in South Lanacashire.  Here can be seen most clearly the degradation into which the worker sinks owing to the introduction of steam power, machinery and the division of labour.  Here, too, can be seen most the strenuous efforts of the proletariat to raise themselves from their degraded situation. (50)And Engels makes some astute observations about the design of industrial towns:Owing to the curious lay-out of the town it is quite possible for someone to live for years in Manchester and to travel daily to and from his work without ever seeing a working-class quarter r coming into contact with an artisan.  He who visits Manchester simply on business or for pleasure need never see the slums, mainly because the working-class districts and the middle-class districts are quite distinct. (54)These descriptions offer two things: a hypothesis about urban growth and the creation of slums, and an ethnographic interpretation of the lived experience of people who find themselves trapped in modern cities.  (Notice how similar this description of the slum dweller's life is to the description that Marx offers in his elaboration of the theory of alienation in the Economic and Philosophic Manuscripts.)Finally, there is plainly an effort to provide an explanation of the phenomena Engels describes, based on an analysis of an underlying causal process: the rapid development of a capitalist system of property ownership and factory production.  Engels brings almost every aspect of the degrading social circumstances that he chronicles back to exploitation and the insatiable appetite of capital for profits at the expense of workers.  This is a single-factor explanation of a process that was surely multi-dimensional.  But it illustrates an important aspect of sociological explanation: the need to discover some of the underlying processes that give rise to the phenomena that have been discovered.So -- is it sociology or is it radical propaganda?  It's a mix of both.  The sociology is of course only partially formed; the next century still had a lot of work to do in conceptualizing how a scientific perspective might be brought to the analysis of society.  (And of course that work isn't finished yet.)  But Engels' efforts here are noteworthy.  And of course it is also a document of political advocacy, in line with writings of liberal and radical reformers elsewhere in Britain and Europe.  It is also very interesting to me that the book is written by Engels largely prior to his substantial collaboration with Marx.  And this goes some ways towards validating the idea that Engels himself was an important thinker and theorist of society.(The documentary photography of the slums of New York by Jacob Riis (How the Other Half Lives: Studies Among the Tenements of New York) seems to have much of the same motivation as Engels' in Condition of the Working Class in England when it comes to a morally inspired desire to reveal the social reality of slums.  See Bonnie Yochelson and Daniel Czitrom's Rediscovering Jacob Riis: The Reformer, His Journalism, and His Photographs for a book that is getting some justified attention.)I have mentioned Saskia Sassen in previous postings, as one of the world's leading theorists of the global city.  Here is an interesting lecture that she presented at the UrbanAge India conference in Mumbai in 2007.  The lecture is very interesting, and it is also \"self-illustrating,\" in that its availability on YouTube illustrates the remarkable globalization of ideas and discourse that has been created by internet communications tools available everywhere in the world.  She talks about cities as centers of \"urban knowledge capital\", and refers to the mechanisms of communication through which these centers are linked, including especially the channels of internet-based communication and interaction.  And the availability of the real-time thinking of leading scholars such as Sassen through YouTube, Google, and other tools -- presented in Mumbai, equally and almost immediately available in Mexico City, Lagos, and London -- is a dramatic illustration of the potential for diffusion and infusion of knowledge that the internet presents to the global world.Urban Age India: Saskia Sassen Cities in Global Context Pt 1Urban Age India: Saskia Sassen Cities in Global Context Pt 2Urban Age India: Saskia Sassen Cities in Global Context Pt 3"}, {"title": "What is materialism?", "date": "Wednesday, July 2, 2008", "text": "Karl Marx was a materialist thinker.  But what does this amount to?  What is materialism as a way of thinking about historical and social reality?  Is materialism an empirical theory, a philosophical theory, or perhaps part of a social-science paradigm?Here is a statement of Marx's materialism from the German Ideology, written in 1845-46: The premises from which we begin are not arbitrary ones, not dogmas, but real premises from which abstraction can only be made in the imagination. They are the real individuals, their activity and the material conditions under which they live, both those which they find already existing and those produced by their activity. These premises can thus be verified in a purely empirical way.The first premise of all human history is, of course, the existence of living human individuals. Thus the first fact to be established is the physical organisation of these individuals and their consequent relation to the rest of nature. Of course, we cannot here go either into the actual physical nature of man, or into the natural conditions in which man finds himself \u2013 geological, hydrographical, climatic and so on. The writing of history must always set out from these natural bases and their modification in the course of history through the action of men.Men can be distinguished from animals by consciousness, by religion or anything else you like. They themselves begin to distinguish themselves from animals as soon as they begin to produce their means of subsistence, a step which is conditioned by their physical organisation. By producing their means of subsistence men are indirectly producing their actual material life.The way in which men produce their means of subsistence depends first of all on the nature of the actual means of subsistence they find in existence and have to reproduce. This mode of production must not be considered simply as being the production of the physical existence of the individuals. Rather it is a definite form of activity of these individuals, a definite form of expressing their life, a definite mode of life on their part. As individuals express their life, so they are. What they are, therefore, coincides with their production, both with what they produce and with how they produce. The nature of individuals thus depends on the material conditions determining their production.This production only makes its appearance with the increase of population. In its turn this presupposes the intercourse [Verkehr] of individuals with one another. The form of this intercourse is again determined by production.To start, Marx's words here are directed against \"philosophy\", and the Young Hegelians in particular.  So Marx is advocating for a different form of reasoning -- not speculative philosophical reflection, but concrete analysis grounded in knowledge of the circumstances of human life.  Marx is saying that we can understand certain important things -- for example, the development of ideas or religion -- by examining the \"material\" circumstances of life in which they emerge.  And what are those circumstances?  They are circumstances of material need and human labor: the fact that human beings satisfy their material needs on the basis of the transformation of nature through labor.  So what is \"material\" in this setting is two characteristics: the material needs that human beings have (food, shelter, warmth) and the material-physical properties of the world in which human beings find themselves.  Human beings as \"producers\" -- intelligent transformers of nature through individual and social labor -- this is the fundamental material fact in this passage.History comes into this account through Marx's reference to the \"nature of the actual means of subsistence they find in existence\", because this is the social history of technology.  Human beings create new tools and techniques over time.  So materialism, when applied to human beings, has an inherently historical character; men and women transform the tools and knowledge they use in order to transform nature and satisfy needs.  And, as the following paragraphs make clear, the social relations through which production takes place are themselves historical products, in a regular process of change and development.  Social relationships are \"material\" insofar as they are the forms of cooperation through which labor and production take place; central among these material social relationships are the property relations of a given level of society.These comments focus primarily on the conditions of production as a foundation for materialism.  A related line of thought in Marx's writings is the idea of the social relations of production as the material foundation of society.  Here is a famous passage from Marx's Preface to A Contribution to the Critique of Political Economy (1859):In the social production of their existence, men inevitably enter into definite relations, which are independent of their will, namely relations of production appropriate to a given stage in the development of their material forces of production. The totality of these relations of production constitutes the economic structure of society, the real foundation, on which arises a legal and political superstructure and to which correspond definite forms of social consciousness. The mode of production of material life conditions the general process of social, political and intellectual life. It is not the consciousness of men that determines their existence, but their social existence that determines their consciousness. At a certain stage of development, the material productive forces of society come into conflict with the existing relations of production or \u2013 this merely expresses the same thing in legal terms \u2013 with the property relations within the framework of which they have operated hitherto.  From forms of development of the productive forces these relations turn into their fetters. Then begins an era of social revolution. The changes in the economic foundation lead sooner or later to the transformation of the whole immense superstructure.    In studying such transformations it is always necessary to distinguish between the material transformation of the economic conditions of production, which can be determined with the precision of natural science, and the legal, political, religious, artistic or philosophic \u2013 in short, ideological forms in which men become conscious of this conflict and fight it out. Just as one does not judge an individual by what he thinks about himself, so one cannot judge such a period of transformation by its consciousness, but, on the contrary, this consciousness must be explained from the contradictions of material life, from the conflict existing between the social forces of production and the relations of production. No social order is ever destroyed before all the productive forces for which it is sufficient have been developed, and new superior relations of production never replace older ones before the material conditions for their existence have matured within the framework of the old society.    Mankind thus inevitably sets itself only such tasks as it is able to solve, since closer examination will always show that the problem itself arises only when the material conditions for its solution are already present or at least in the course of formation. In broad outline, the Asiatic, ancient, feudal and modern bourgeois modes of production may be designated as epochs marking progress in the economic development of society. The bourgeois mode of production is the last antagonistic form of the social process of production \u2013 antagonistic not in the sense of individual antagonism but of an antagonism that emanates from the individuals' social conditions of existence \u2013 but the productive forces developing within bourgeois society create also the material conditions for a solution of this antagonism. The prehistory of human society accordingly closes with this social formation.  Here the emphasis is on the social relations of production, not just the forces of production (tools, materials, technical knowledge).  And on this approach, study of the class relations of a given society is a \"materialist\" study -- even though class relations are abstract and intangible.  And we provide a materialist analysis of a circumstance when we show how that circumstance corresponds to or emerges from certain features of the social relations of production.So far, then, we seem to have two things going on: first, an approach to the history of ideas (\"place systems of ideas into the roles they play in the social arrangements through which human populations satisfy material needs\"), and an approach to the unfolding of history more generally (\"attempt to understand historical developments in terms of the role they play in production and the satisfaction of needs\").  So materialism is a theory about historical causation: what kinds of circumstances cause what other kinds of circumstances.  And, perhaps, it is a theory about knowledge: that knowledge proceeds from analysis of material facts, not pure philosophical speculation or imagination.There seem to be several hazards built into this approach.  One is the temptation of reductionism that the approach seems to invite: the impulse to reduce thought, theory, and philosophy to some compound of the \"needs of the social system of production\".  But is it really compelling to imagine that the Young Hegelians were simply working out some of the contradictions of the system of property and factory manufacturing?  No; Marx's rhetoric seems to be getting away from him here -- in ways in which later thinkers such as Mannheim perhaps allowed the sociology of knowledge to spin out of control as well.  And the hazard of reductionism also raises the worry of a blindspot when it comes to the relative autonomy of politics or culture: human beings seem to be better at imagining and extending political or cultural inventions than a crude materialism would permit.So a defensible contemporary materialism can't be as simple as this: \"Material conditions determine the content of culture, politics, and thought.\"  Rather, we might hold more modestly: \"Material conditions constrain, influence, and stimulate the content of culture, politics, and thought.\"  We can understand Aristotle's philosophy better when we understand something of its material and historical setting; but the fact remains that Aristotle was a creative and imaginative philosopher who transcended his time in a variety of ways.So, once again, what sort of theory is materialism?  Perhaps we could say this: it is a \"meta\" - framework, a philosophical premise about how the world works. In this respect it functions as a substantive metaphysical theory.  And it is a premise about how a style of thinking, a recommendation about how we should reason about the world and what factors to subject to careful analysis.  Here materialism serves as something like an applied epistemology -- a theory about how and what to investigate in order to arrive at valuable, justified knowledge.  It falls in the general category of ideas such as idealism, monism, atomism, physicalism, or dualism: organizing ideas about the nature of reality, within the context of which more specific theorizing and investigating can take place.There are many questions that remain.  Do these two aspects of materialism hang together?  Could one accept the metaphysics but reject the epistemology, or vice versa?  Once we have rejected the reductionism associated with vulgar materialism, how much remains of the theory?  And is there a continuing role for materialist thinking in the twenty-first century world?(Courbet's Stonebreakers is a suitable companion to this topic.  Painted in 1849-50, the painting illustrates several aspects of a materialist perspective on the world: an interest in conditions of life and work, an interest in the situation of ordinary working people, and, of course, the depiction of concrete labor -- all of these aspects of the painting complement the mentality of Marx's materialism.  T. J. Clark's brilliant book on Courbet and his social context is well worth reading (Image of the People: Gustave Courbet and the 1848 Revolution).)"}, {"title": "More on continental philosophy of social science", "date": "Monday, June 30, 2008", "text": "I encourage interested readers to take a look at the very thoughtful and extensive comment provided by Nick from accursedshare on my earlier posting on continental philosophy of social science.

Here I'd like to take a different approach and ask the question, what considerations can be offered in support of some version of social holism?Here are a couple of arguments that avoid the accusation of \"spooky holism\". (By spooky I mean \"disembodied.\")First is a very reasonable point deriving from pragmatic objections to reductionism. If we know on ontological grounds that the behavior of the whole depends upon the features and behavior of the constituent parts and nothing else -- the heart of the theory of supervenience -- but also know that it is entirely hopeless to attempt to calculate the one based on facts about the other -- then perhaps it is justified to consider the whole as if it embodied causal processes at the macro-level. So there is a pragmatic argument available that recommends the autonomy of social facts based on the infeasibility of derivability.Second is the plausibility of the idea that there are large historical or social forces that are for all intents and purposes beyond the control of any of the individuals whom they influence. The fact that a given population exists as a language community of German speakers or Yoruba speakers has an effect on every child born into that population. The child's brain is shaped by this social reality, quite independently from facts about the child's agency or individuality. The grammar of the local language is an autonomous social fact in this context -- even though it is a fact that is embodied in the particular brains and behaviors of the countless individuals who constitute this community.  But this is probably similarly true when we turn to systems of attitudes, norms, or cognitive systems of thinking.  (See a posting on social practices on this subject.)It is obvious but perhaps trivial to observe that the vector of influence flows through individuals who possess the grammar, norms, or folk beliefs -- this is the ontological reality captured by the microfoundations thesis. But perhaps a point in favor of a modest holism is this: the fact of the commonality of Yoruba grammar can be viewed as if it were an autonomous fact -- even though we know it depends on the existence of Yoruba speakers. But the point of the holism thesis here remains: that the social fact of the current grammar is coercive with respect to current Nigerian children in specific communities. And, perhaps, likewise with respect to other aspects of social cognition and norms.  And this takes us some distance towards Durkheim's central view -- the autonomy of social facts.Now what about social structures? Can some instances of social structures be treated as if they were autonomous with respect to the individuals whom they affect?  Here is how the home mortgage system works -- we can specify a collection of rules and practices X, Y, Z that regulate the transactions that occur within this system. The individual who wants to borrow from a bank or other financial institution is simply subject to these rules and practices. He/she doesn't have the option of rewriting the rules in a more rational or fair or socially progressive way; at a given point in time the rules and practices are fixed independently from the wishes or intentions of the people involved in the institution. Once again it is trivially true that these rules are embodied; but they function as if they were autonomous. And this is true for institutions at the full range of scope, from the local to the global.The advocate for a modest social holism might maintain two plausible positions: first, that all social facts are embodied in the states of mind and behavior of individuals; but second, that some social facts (institutions, social practices, systems of rules) have explanatory autonomy independent from any knowledge we might be able to provide about the particular ways in which these facts are embodied in individuals.  The first is an ontological point and the second is a point about explanation.These points in favor of a modest holism are compatible with other important points about social entities -- the points about heterogeneity, plasticity, and opportunistic transformation that have been made elsewhere in this blog.  In other words, we aren't forced to choose between \"agent\" and \"structure\"; rather, agents influence structures and structures influence agents.These arguments suggest two things. First, holism and individualism are not so sharply opposed as perhaps they appear.But more important, two styles of social explanation are validated and compatible: the compositional or aggregative model of explanation -- explain the outcome as the aggregative consequence of the behavior of large numbers of individuals -- and constraining or filtering explanations -- the structuring of individual behavior that is created by the workings of social institutions. The first model of explanation corresponds well to the assumptions of methodological individualism, while the second corresponds to the idea that structures and large social factors cause patterns of individual behavior.  And neither has antecedent priority over the other.  (Some of this variety of explanatory strategies is highlighted in an earlier posting on explanation.)"}, {"title": "Continental philosophy of social science", "date": "Saturday, June 28, 2008", "text": "Making sense of the human world has always been a part of the continental tradition in philosophy. History, justice, and meaning are subjects that have played central roles in continental writings relevant to \"understanding society\" for three centuries, and dozens of philosophers have focused on these and related topics in deeply fertile ways -- Kant, Rousseau, Hegel, Montesquieu, Vico, Herder, Schleiermacher, Fichte, Feuerbach, Marx, Nietzsche, and Dilthey, to name an important dozen. I don't think it is wrong to say that history and society have been foundational questions in this tradition in ways they have not been in the Anglo-American tradition. So continental philosophy of social science (CPS) has much to draw upon.Several strands of thinking have been particularly important.First is the idea that the human world is a world of meanings and relationships. Human action is meaningful for the agent, and it is meaningful for the other humans who are affected or observe it. So an important part of understanding the social world is interpretation of the created meanings of actions, expressions, and artifacts. This line of thought brings us into the hermeneutic tradition, from Dilthey to Ricoeur, and the range of efforts in philosophy, theology, criticism, and psychology to provide a basis for interpretation.  (See an earlier posting on this subject.)A second important idea is the notion that the social world is constituted by relationships, not monads. Hegel's Phenomenology provides one clear instance of this perspective -- think of the logic of defining the subject through interaction with the object, or of the Master-Slave narrative. Marx's theories of alienation and class likewise place \"human beings in relationships\" at the ontological center. Nietzsche too places the relational at the center of many of his philosophical theories.A third pillar of thinking in this tradition is the crucial role of history in human affairs. History matters; it is through history that humanity makes itself, and central social creations are the product of long historical evolution -- the state, language, religion. Vico and Herder offer good examples of this approach, and Hegel offers another.  The philosophy of history is core to Hegel's thinking -- not only in his lecture notes on the philosophy of history but the Philosophy of Right and the Phenomenology of Spirit as well.A fourth important theme in CPS is the idea of knowledge through criticism. Feuerbach's transformative criticism is a case in point; likewise Marx's method of critique as an intellectual method and a conception of rigor. The phrase \"a critique of political economy\" recurs in numerous of Marx's subtitles; Marx's thought often proceeds through critical rethinking of the works of others. Dialectical thinking is one version of this approach, but there are other species of criticism as well.A fifth defining characteristic of CPS is the orientation it takes towards causation in the social world. In a nutshell, CPS doesn't attach much importance to causal relationships in the social world. Causation is a feature of the natural world, but CPS draws a sharp distinction between the natural and human worlds. The \"human sciences\" have to do with understanding rather than explanation, meanings rather than causes.So, CPS calls out a number of characteristics of the social -- history, meaning, hermeneutics, relationships, criticism, and dialogical thinking, to name several. What this picture does not emphasize is the set of ideas defining scientific rigor for the analytic tradition: an organized conception of theory, a theory of observation and evidence, the idea of the neutrality of scientific knowledge. This is systemic, because CPS is explicitly and implicitly anti-positivist. The implicit part is the more interesting.  The continental tradition has a very different philosophical framework for epistemology and knowledge than the empiricist tradition, and a different conception about what constitutes rigorous knowledge. It is more inclined towards philosophical reasoning as a source of knowledge and generally less devoted to empirical inquiry.We might ask, though, how these themes in the philosophy of society and history help us today in the problem of articulating better and more rationally justified theories or representations of the social world. Does CPS provide any clues about how to configure a better sociology for China or a better theory of social relationships in the Internet age? Does it improve our epistemology of social knowledge? Does it broaden the scope of our historical or sociological imaginations? Does it provide the basis for some salutary critique?  Does it deepen needed critiques of positivism and naturalism? (See accursedshare for a current blog that takes this tradition and these questions seriously.)What seems likely is that both traditions are needed as a foundation for understanding society. They emphasize different but important perspectives on the social world.  And further, there are very few flat contradictions between the two traditions. So a fertile collaboration is entirely feasible.Yvonne Sherratt's Continental Philosophy of Social Science asks us to initiate this reflection -- and she is right. Other titles I have appreciated for their treatment of Hegel's philosophy of society and history include Shlomo Avineri, Hegel's Theory of the Modern State; Joshua Dienstag, Dancing in Chains: Narrative and Memory in Political Theory, and Alexandre Kojeve, Introduction to the Reading of Hegel: Lectures on the Phenomenology of Spirit.  These books illustrate how continental philosophy makes a substantial contribution to understanding society and history."}, {"title": "Higher education and social mobility", "date": "Thursday, June 26, 2008", "text": "There is an appalling level of inequality in American society; and even more troubling, the multiple dimensions of inequality seem to reinforce each other, with the result that disadvantaged groups remain disadvantaged across multiple generations.  We can ask two different kinds of sociological questions about these facts:  What factors cause the reproduction of disadvantage over multiple generations? And what policy interventions have some effect on enhancing upward social mobility within disadvantaged groups?  How can we change this cycle of disadvantage?Several earlier postings have addressed some aspects of the causal question (post, post).  Here I'd like to consider the policy question -- and the question of how we can use empirical evidence to evaluate the effectiveness of large policy initiatives on social outcomes such as mobility.One social policy in particular seems to have a lot of antecedent plausibility: a policy aimed at increasing the accessibility of higher education to the disadvantaged group.  The theory is that individuals within the group will benefit from higher education by enhancing their skills and knowledge; this will give them new economic opportunities and access to higher-wage jobs; the individuals will do better economically, and their children will begin life with more economic support and a set of values that encourage education.  So access to higher education ought to prove to be a virtuous circle or a positive feedback loop, leading to substantial social mobility in currently disadvantaged groups.It is a plausible theory; but are there empirical methods through which we can evaluate whether it actually works this way?Paul Attewell and David Lavin undertake to do exactly that in Passing the Torch: Does Higher Education for the Disadvantaged Pay Off Across the Generations?, published in 2007.  Their research consists of a survey study of a cohort of poor women who were admitted to the City University of New York between 1970 and 1972 under an open-admissions policy.  Thirty years later Attewell and Lavin surveyed a sample of the women in this group (about 2,000 women), gathering data about their eventual educational attainment, their income, and the educational successes of their children.  Analysis of their data permitted them to demonstrate that attenders were likely to enjoy higher income than non-attenders and to have children who valued education at levels that were higher than the children of non-attenders.The benefits of higher education in increasing personal income were significant; they find that in the population surveyed in 2000, the high school graduate earned $30,000, women with some college earned $35,000, women with the associate's degree earned $40,783, women with the bachelor's degree earned $42,063, and women with a postgraduate degree earned $54,545.  In other words, there was a fairly regular progression in income associated with each further step in the higher education credential achieved.  And they found -- contrary to conservative critics of open-access programs in higher education -- that these women demonstrated eventual completion rates that were substantially higher than 4-6 year graduation rates would indicate -- over 70% earned some kind of degree (table 2.2).  \"Our long-range  perspective shows that disadvantaged women ultimately complete college degrees in far greater numbers than scholars realize\" (4).So access to higher education works, according to the evidence uncovered in this study: increasing access to post-secondary education is the causal factor, and improved economic and educational outcomes are the effect.This is an important empirical study that sets out some of the facts that pertain to poverty and higher education.  The study provides empirical confirmation for the idea that affordable and accessible mass education works: when programs are available that permit poor people to gain access to higher education, their future earnings and the future educational success of their children are both enhanced.  It's a logical conclusion -- but one that has been challenged by conservative critics such as Bill Bennett.  And given the increasing financial stress that public universities are currently experiencing due to declining state support for higher education, it is very important for policy makers to have a clear understanding of the return that is likely on the investment in affordable access to higher education."}, {"title": "Explaining rodeos", "date": "Monday, June 23, 2008", "text": "Suppose we have visited quite a few rodeos in Arizona and Texas and have observed a couple of things: there are more injuries in rodeos than in stock car racing or football, the stakes for the winners are lower than in golf, the rodeo riders score higher than average on the \"introverted\" component of the Myers-Briggs personality profile, some rodeos are almost silent places, and the parking lots are filled with a higher percentage of beat-up F150s than a typical baseball park.  What would count as \"giving an explanation\" of these features of this particular type of social activity?  And what kinds of mechanisms might serve as a basis for explanations?Rodeos are an instance of a broader category of social activity that we migh describe along these lines: \"mass entertainment events featuring professional athletes/performers and drawing extensive numbers of paying customers.\"   The comparative judments expressed above take the form of contrasts across several different sub-categories of this broad set -- e.g., baseball, stock car racing, football, golf, soccer, circuses.  We might further analyze this group of events in terms of several structural features: the character of the audience, the character and recruitment processes of the performers, the rules of the event, the culture of the activity, the meaning of the activity within the broader society, and the business fundamentals of the event (sources and quantity of revenue).Let's pull apart a few of the patterns noted above, and consider some social mechanisms that might explain them.Personality profile of rodeo riders.  Rodeo riders seem to have a different social psychology than baseball or soccer players; they are more solitary, introverted, and self-sufficient.  This feature of rodeos presumably derives from the social selection processes through which an individual becomes a highly skilled rider; the personality features that are best suited to superior performance; and the cultural expectations of behavior within the activity and within the broader society.  So an adequate explanation of this distinguishing feature of rodeos will probably invoke the processes of selection through which the performers are recruited, and the feedback and training they receive in the \"minor leagues\" of rodeo.  Here the mechanisms are selection / filtering and training / inculturation.Size of winnings.  The size of the winner's purse depends primarily on the revenue structure of the sport, which depends in turn upon the popularity of the sport, the affluence of the audience, and the size of the national or worldwide audience for the sport on television.  The purse serves as a primary incentive for the most talented performers; rodeo operators compete with each other for the top performers; and competition among operators pushes the purse to a level commensurate with the total revenues generated by the sport.  The audience for stock car racing is much larger than that for rodeo, both regionally and nationally; and the purses are correspondingly higher.  Here the mechanism is business competition.Incidence of injuries.  Riding a bull is a generally hazardous activity.  So we would expect that riders will be injured.  But so is driving a car at 180 miles per hour -- and yet the incidence of injuries in NASCAR racing is substantially lower than that in the rodeo circuit. So paying attention simply to the inherent danger of the activity probably doesn't explain the difference.  Instead, it seems reasonable to ask whether there are institutional differences across these sports -- the structure of the safety systems that each embodies -- that account for different rates of injury in different types of performance.  Industries that have developed genuine institutional commitments and rules governing safety generally demonstrate better safety records.  So we might hypothesize that the culture of safety is less strenuous in the rodeo circuit than in professional football or stockcar racing.  Here the mechanism is the institutional setting in which the activity takes place, including the presence or absence of penalties for operators with bad safety records.The parking lot.  We notice that the distributions of cars and trucks in the parking lots are quite different at rodeos compared to soccer matches.  The vehicles come with their owners; so these differences must derive from differences in the audiences of the two sports.  Here we have another example of selection: the composition of the parking lot corresponds to the selection of people who are interested in attending rodeos; this group has a set of tastes and preferences that favor F150s over other vehicles; and the result is -- a preponderance of pickup trucks in the rodeo parking lot.  (And the trucks are in bad shape for several reasons -- the generally lower income level of the rodeo fan and the likelihood that he/she does a lot of back-country driving.)  The mechanism here is -- social selection.The silent audience.  We observe once in a while that the audience at a small rodeo is plainly enjoying itself -- but there is almost no clapping or shouting.  There is no roar of the crowd.  Why so?  Here we may find a cultural explanation in the background -- this rodeo is drawing an audience of Navajo people, and applauding and shouting are not the means by which Navajo fans express their appreciation and enjoyment.  Here the mechanism is -- cultural practices.What seems interesting to me about this example, is the fact that there are a number of quite different social mechanisms at work that lead to the particular characteristics of such a mundane activity as the rodeo.  There is no single process we should point to as the explanatory foundation of rodeo phenomena; instead, there are selection mechanisms, business incentives, cultural practices, media promotions, and socialization processes for both participants and audiences that influence the activity as a whole.  And, interestingly enough, these mechanisms can lead to some common characteristics across the set of what appear to be a fairly arbitrary set of activities -- public arenas where daring men and women ride large, dangerous animals for pay.  The social characteristics of the audiences, the performers, and the local institutions defining the activity impress a unique stamp on these performances that distinguish them from other public entertainment activities such as circuses or NASCAR races."}, {"title": "Methodological individualism", "date": "Sunday, June 22, 2008", "text": "Methodological individualism (MI) is a doctrine in the philosophy of the social sciences about the relationship between \"society\" and individuals.  The idea can be formulated in several related but somewhat different ways: social facts are constituted by facts about individuals; social entities are composed of individuals and their properties and relations; social structures and entities are \"nothing but\" ensembles of individuals and their behaviors; social explanations must be derivable from facts about individuals; scientific statements about \"society\" must be reducible to statements about individuals and their properties and relations; social laws or generalizations must be derivable from general facts about individuals.  And there are probably other possible formulations as well.So the doctrine of methodological individualism often represents a form of reductionism from one area of scientific theory to another: theories about social entities and properties must be reducible to theories and statements about individuals and their properties.  This line of thought is parallel to materialism in the philosophy of mind or anti-vitalism in the philosophy of biology.  Mental states must be reducible to a set of facts about neurophysiology; statements about living organisms must be reducible to a set of facts about the molecular chemistry and physiology of cells.  (See Ingo Brigandt and Alan Love's article in the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy on reduction in biology.)A somewhat less restrictive view than reductionism is the theory of \"supervenience\" between levels of scientific description.  According to the theory of supervenience, facts at one level of description are fixed or determined by facts at a lower level of description.  To say that X supervenes upon Y is to say that there is no difference between states of affairs concerning X for which there is not also a difference in states of affairs concerning Y.  This is a less restrictive doctrine because it doesn't require that we provide derivations of the facts of X from facts of Y.  (Jaegwon Kim is the primary innovator here; see Physicalism, or Something Near Enough for a recent formulation of the theory.)Methodological individualism is the limit version of a family of perspectives on social explanation that we might refer to as \"agent-centered\" approaches to social explanation. Here the general idea is that we explain social outcomes as an aggregate result of the actions, choices, and mentalities of individuals. Individuals' behavior and choice constitute the causal dynamics of social outcomes.  The idea of \"microfoundations\" has played an important role in recent thinking about the relationship between social facts and individual facts. (See Microfoundations, Methods, and Causation for more on the idea of microfoundations for social explanations.)But agent-centered approaches can give more \"social-ness\" to the individual than the founding statements of MI would permit. For example, the position of \"methodological localism\" identifies socially constituted and socially situated individuals as the foundation of social explanation; but this position explicitly denies the idea that all social facts are reducible to bare psychological facts about individuals. Rather, individuals are themselves constituted and constrained by previously established social conditions.  (See \"Levels of the Social\" for more about methodological localism.)The idea of methodological individualism is one that has appealed to philosophers and social thinkers for almost as long as there has been systematic thinking about social science.  Modern philosophy of social science began in the nineteenth century, and John Stuart Mill's theories of social knowledge contained the assumption of methodological individualism (The Logic of the Moral Sciences). Max Weber also put forward the doctrine in The Methodology Of The Social Sciences.  A classic statement was presented by J. W. N. Watkins (1968), \"Methodological Individualism and Social Tendencies\" in May Brodbeck, Readings in the Philosophy of the Social Sciences.The logical contrary of MI is the idea of social holism, most explicitly advocated by Emile Durkheim in Rules of Sociological Method.  Holism is a form of anti-reductionism; it maintains that there are facts about the social world that do not reduce to facts about individuals.  Society is autonomous with respect to the individuals who \"make it up\".  There are social forces (e.g. systems of norms) that exercise causal power over individuals, instead of norms being constituted by the psychological states of individuals.  Other varieties of social holism are possible as well.  Structuralism is the view that social structures exercise autonomous causal properties, as expressed in such authors as Levi Strauss, Althusser, and Foucault.Arguments in favor of methodological individualism derive from several insights.  First, there is the point that social facts are evidently constituted by the thoughts and behaviors of groups of individuals.  Social movements are composed of individuals with specific psychologies and beliefs; organizations are composed of individuals; and, arguably, moralities and cultures are made up of individuals with specific beliefs and values.  Second, there is the point that social \"laws\" are rare, exception-laden, and conditional; so there is a methodological reason to look for the more basic laws that may regulate social behavior -- at the level of individuals and their psychology.  Third, there is a preference for ontological sparsity: if we can explain social facts in terms of facts about individuals, then we don't need to attribute ontological status to social facts and entities.  Fourth, there is a \"materialist\" or anti-occultist preference that is appealing to many philosophers; the idea that social facts might be autonomous with respect to individuals gives an impression of occult causal powers or action at a distance.  So there is a range of reasons to think that social outcomes are made up of or determined by the aggregate results of individuals and their interactions.MI has been particularly appealing in certain disciplines of the social sciences -- especially economics and political science.  In each case the perspective of \"rational actor theory\" has appeared to be a very promising line of explanation: explain the behavior of groups (consumers, voters) as the aggregate outcome of individuals making choices with a specific set of beliefs and preferences, within a specific set of constraints.Other areas of the social sciences are less amenable to the theory of methodological individualism.  Anthropology and sociology are disciplines that set the focus on the higher-level social conditions or causes that influence behavior -- a perspective that seems to be more comfortable with some form of holism.  However, there is a range of opinion among practitioners of these disciplines as well, and there are anthropologists and sociologists who are more sympathetic to the impulses of methodological individualism.It is important to highlight some points that MI does not entail.  MI does not entail that individuals are egoists or purely self-regarding.  It does not entail that individuals are not social.  It does not entail that social facts do not have causal consequences -- for other social facts and for individual behavior.  It is indeed possible to reframe almost all substantive sociological theory in terms that are consistent with the reasonable conditions implied by MI.   Even Durkheim's central theories can be formulated in a way that is innocent with respect to the charge of \"action at a distance\".  And, from the other direction, even a theorist with as clear a commitment to MI as Max Weber, is still able to make \"macro\" or \"holistic\" claims about the causal importance of factors such as religion or morality.This sounds like a simple question.  It sounds as if it is asking for us to discover a set of factors that influence the level of performance of individuals within a population when they get to colleges and universities.  And we might speculate that there is a small group of potentially relevant factors: antecedent cognitive ability, attitudes, and values; location within a set of social relations that enhance or impede successful educational performance; quality of educational resources provided in K-12.  We might reason that a given individual's performance is affected by his/her ability and motivation; enhancing or inhibiting circumstances; quality of educational \"treatment\"; and chance events or circumstances (a lucky break, an inspiring grandfather).  And by examining antecedent conditions and outcomes across a large population of people, we might expect to be able to assess the degree to which various hypothesized factors in fact lead to differences in the performance of sub-populations defined by these factors.  This analysis should shed light on the question, \"What factors cause differences in university success?\".Sorting this out sounds like a straightforward empirical question.  Consider this hypothetical study.  First, identify a cohort of high school seniors -- let's say, all the seniors in 2000 in metropolitan Boston.  Suppose this is 5,000 people.  (1) Measure a set of features of their situation during high school: high school performance, family situation, features of the school attended, socioeconomic status, family status, racial-ethnic status. (2) Measure a set of psychological characteristics for each individual: motivation, determination, aptitude for mathematics, ...  And, (3), measure college success five years following high school graduation (GPA, credit hours completed, degree attained).Let's say that each individual is coded for ABILITY (1, 2, 3); MOTIVATION (1, 2, 3); SOCIOECONOMIC STATUS (1, 2, 3); RACE (A, B, C); FAMILY STATUS (A, B); HIGH SCHOOL QUALITY (1, 2, 3); HIGH SCHOOL PERFORMANCE (1, 2, 3); and a factor representing one particular educational or curricular theory -- let's say, PEER COUNSELING (T,F).  And let's say that outcomes are coded as DEGREE (NONE, ASSOCIATES, BACHELORS, MASTERS, PROFESSIONAL) and GPA (1, 2, 3).Now follow these individuals for 10 years: What further education do they pursue? Do they complete post-secondary education? What is their performance in post-secondary education? What occupations and jobs do they get? What income do they achieve by age 30? How much unemployment have they experienced?Finally, we will do some basic statistics on this data set: compute the incomes and schooling for various sub-categories; test for correlations between outcomes and antecedent conditions; etc.  Are there differences in outcomes when we cross-tabulate by ABILITY or MOTIVATION? What about if we cross-tabulate by RACE or SES?  This analysis may produce statements like these hypothetical findings:People who completed high school with high performance were 2.5 times as likely to complete a college degree as those with a low performance.People whose family income was in the top quintile were 5 times as likely to complete a college degree as those from families in the bottom quintile.The college completion rate for white students, Hispanic students, and African-American students were X, Y, and Z respectively.High school graduates from high schools with peer counseling programs were X percent more likely to complete a bachelor's degree.People living in single-parent households during high school had completion rates of X compared to Y for dual-parent households.A study along these lines provides a first indication of how some of these social characteristics may be related to performance in college.  If a factor is not causally related to the outcome, then the population possessing this factor should have the same performances as the population lacking this factor (the null hypothesis).  So if we find that differences in family structure or performance in high school are associated with differences in college performance, then we can infer that these factors play some causal or structural role in the outcome.However, these findings do not establish specific causal linkages among the factors.  Take the hypothetical finding about family income: is this statistical discovery the result of this mechanism (greater family income provides more support for tutoring and academic support) or this mechanism (greater family income is associated with familial values that put strong emphasis on successful completion of university degree) or this mechanism (greater family income confers social advantages that make completion easier for affluent students)?  In other words, the statistical discovery does not determine the nature of the causal relation between the antecedent condition and the outcome; it simply points the researcher towards investigating the concrete social mechanisms that might be at work here.The example demonstrates an important lesson about social inquiry.  Statistical study of a population can in fact point us towards some preliminary hypotheses about social causation.  But these statistical discoveries are only the first step.  In order to confidently assert causal relationships between things like income and race, to educational outcomes, we need to arrive at a nuanced analysis of the social relations and institutions through which these gross factors play into individual outcomes.  We need to have an account of the mechanisms and processes through which the effects of concrete social settings characterized by differences in family structure, SES, race, or schools play out in the social psychology and educational opportunities that determine the ultimate outcomes of the young people who pass through them.(A similar line of thought can be found in this posting on the problem of sorting out the data establishing correlations between race and asthma.)"}, {"title": "Tributaries of the philosophy of the social sciences", "date": "Saturday, June 21, 2008", "text": "The philosophy of the social sciences is largely focused on questions about the nature of our knowledge, representation, and explanation of social phenomena.  There is an ontological side to some of the questions in this field -- for example, what is the nature of social phenomena?  But many of the questions are epistemological, having to do with the conditions of knowledge and representation that obtain when it comes to social facts.  I think it is useful to sketch out a map that indicates the topography of some of the fundamental questions and approaches that have contributed to a better understanding of social science.  And this effort will demonstrate that there is no single, coherent field that is the \"philosophy of social science\"; instead, there are overlapping and intertwined efforts by several traditions to arrive at better and more justified representations of social knowledge.The fruitful ideas in this field derive from several separate tributaries, it seems to me.  One important source is the group of \"founders\" of the social sciences who themselves thought very hard about the question of the conditions of establishing a social \"science\".  Max Weber, Emile Durkheim, Georg Simmel, William Thomas, and George Herbert Mead all had original and insightful ideas about what a scientific study of social reality might consist in.  And, in most instances, these ideas were driven by their acquaintance with the richness of social life rather than by philosophical presuppositions.  So these founders forged a philosophy of social research along the way as they constructed their models of what theory and research ought to look like in the study of the social world.Another important source for current philosophy of social science is the tradition of empiricism that led to twentieth-century analytic philosophy of science.  Here we can highlight John Stuart Mill, Moritz Schlick, Carl Hempel, and Ernest Nagel as philosophers who brought the machinery of positivist epistemology to a conception of what the social sciences ought to look like.  As suggested in an earlier posting, there are profound problems with some of these ideas; but there is no doubt that they have been influential.  And this influence shows up very explicitly in social science writings concerned with the logic of quantitative social research.There is another source for contemporary philosophy of social science that has something in common with both these but is nonetheless distinct.  This is the impulse that comes from rational choice theory and the idea that social patterns are the expression of individual rational choices.  Mill's writings suggest this idea, and it is a very strong component of the classics defining microeconomic theory as well (Walras, Pareto, the Austrian school).  The effort to bring decision theory and game theory into play in explaining concrete social developments is a manifestation of this approach -- for example, Samuel Popkin's work on peasant rebellions (The Rational Peasant: The Political Economy of Rural Society in Vietnam).  What makes this framework philosophical is the implicit idea of reductionism that it offers as a strategy of explanation: high-level social facts need to be decomposed into logical compounds of lower-level facts at the level of individuals.  (This is the doctrine of methodological individualism.)The intellectual framework of \"scientific realism\" is also an important tributary to contemporary philosophy of social science.  Against the instrumentalism associated with positivism, this approach maintains that the social or natural worlds possess an objective set of characteristics, and it is possible to know the approximate outlines of these characteristics.  When brought into contact with the social sciences, realism leads us to expect that there are real social structures, conditions, and causes, and that it is one of the functions of social science to describe those real circumstances and their relationships with each other.  The recent emphasis on \"social-causal mechanisms\" is a version of scientific realism in application to the social world -- for example, Social Mechanisms: An Analytical Approach to Social Theory.There are two other tributaries that are important contributions but that have been less influential for analytic philosophers of social science, one deriving from Marx and the other from thinkers like Dilthey and Gadamer.  The first is materialism and an emphasis on social structures, and the other is the hermeneutic tradition.  The materialist tradition attempts to organize social reality around a set of structures with causal properties (modes of production, property relations, forms of technology).  The hermeneutic tradition takes \"social action\" as the fundamental social fact, and looks at the challenge of interpreting social action as the fundamental problem in social research. Yvonne Sherratt's Continental Philosophy of Social Science is a very useful study of the influence of these traditions, and I will return to her discussion in a later posting."}, {"title": "Quasi-experimental data?", "date": "Thursday, June 19, 2008", "text": "Stan Lieberson is one of a group of sociologists for whom I have great respect when it comes to intelligent thinking about social science methodology. His 1985 book, Making It Count: The Improvement of Social Research and Theory, is a good example of some of this thinking about the foundations of social science knowledge, and I also admire A Matter of Taste: How Names, Fashions, and Culture Change in the way it offers a genuinely novel topic and method of approach.Lieberson urges us to consider \"a different way of thinking about the rigorous study of society implied by the phrase 'science of society'\" instead of simply assuming that social science should resemble natural science (3-4). His particular object of criticism in this book is the tendency of quantitative social scientists to use the logic of experiments to characterize the data they study.An experiment is an attempt to measure the causal effects of one factor X on another factor Z by isolating a domain of phenomena -- holding constant all other causal factors -- and systematically varying one causal factor to observe the effect this factor has on an outcome of interest.  The basic assumption is that an outcome is the joint effect of a set of (as yet unknown) causal conditions:C1 & C2 & ... & Cn cause Z,where we do not yet know the contents of the list Ci.  We consider the hypothesis that Cm is one of the causes of Z.  We design an experimental environment in which we are able to hold constant all the potentially relevant causal conditions we can think of (thereby holding fixed Ci), and we systematically vary the presence or absence of Cm and observe the state of the outcome Z.  If Z varies appropriately with the presence or absence of Cm, we tentatively conclude that Cm is one of the causes of Z.In cases where individual differences among samples or subjects may affect the outcome, or where the causal processes in question are probabilistic rather than deterministic, experimentation requires treating populations rather than individuals and assuring randomization of subjects across \"treatment\" and \"no-treatment\" groups.  This involves selecting a number of subjects, randomly assigning them to controlled conditions in which all other potential causal factors are held constant, exposing one set of subjects to the treatment X while withholding the treatment from the other group, and measuring the outcome variable in the two groups. If there is a significant difference in the mean value of the outcome variable between the treatment group and the control group, then we can tentatively conclude that X causes Z and perhaps estimate the magnitude of the effect. Take tomato yields per square meter (Z) as affected by fertilizer X: plants in the control group are subjected to a standard set of growing conditions, while the treatment group receives these conditions plus the measured dose of X. We then measure the quantity produced by the two plots and estimate the effect of X. The key ideas here are causal powers,  random assignment, control, and single-factor treatment.However, Lieberson insists that most social data are not collected under experimental conditions. It is normally not possible to randomly assign individuals to groups and then observe the effects of interventions.  Likewise, it is not possible to systematically control the factors that are present or absent for different groups of subjects.  If we want to know whether \"presence of hate speech on radio broadcasts\" causes \"situations of ethnic conflict\" to progress to \"situations of ethnic violence\" -- we don't have the option of identifying a treatment group and a control group of current situations of ethnic conflict, and then examine whether the treatment with \"hate speech on radio broadcasts\" increases the incidence of ethnic violence in the treatment group relative to the control group.  And it is fallacious to reason about non-experimental data using the assumptions developed for analysis of experiments. This fallacy involves making \"assumptions that appear to be matters of convenience but in reality generate analyses that are completely off the mark\" (6).Suppose we want to investigate whether being a student athlete affects academic performance in college. In order to treat this topic experimentally we would need to select a random group of newly admitted students; randomly assign one group of individuals to athletic programs and the other group to a non-athletic regime; and measure the academic performance of each individual after a period of time. Let's say that GPA is the performance measure and that we find that the athlete group has a mean GPA of 3.1 while the non-athlete group has an average of 2.8. This would be an experimental confirmation of the hypothesis that \"participation in athletics improves academic performance.\"However, this thought experiment demonstrates the common problem about social data: it is not possible to perform this experiment. Rather, students decide for themselves whether they want to compete in athletics, and their individual characteristics will determine whether they will succeed. Instead, we have to work with the social realities that exist; and this means identifying a group of students who have chosen to participate in athletics; comparing them with a \"comparable\" group of students who have chosen not to participate in athletics; and measuring the academic performance of the two groups.  But here we have to confront two crucial problems: selectivity and the logic of \"controlling\" for extraneous factors.Selectivity comes in when we consider that the same factors that lead a college student to participate in athletics may also influence his/her academic performance; so measuring the difference between the two groups may only measure the effects of this selective difference between membership in the groups -- not the effect of the experience of participating in athletics on academic performance.  In order to correct for selectivity, the researcher may attempt to control for potentially influential differences between the two groups; so he/she may attempt to control for family factors, socio-economic status, performance in secondary school, and a set of psycho-social variables.  \"Controlling\" in this context means selecting sub-groups within the two populations that are statistically similar with respect to the variables to be controlled for.  Group A and Group B have approximately the same distribution of family characteristics, parental income, and high school GPA; the individuals in the two groups are \"substantially similar\".  We have \"controlled\" for these potentially relevant causal factors -- so any observed differences between academic performance across the two groups can be attributed to the treatment, \"participation in athletics.\" But Lieberson makes a critical point about this approach: there is commonly unmeasured selectivity within the control variables themselves -- crudely, students with the same family characteristics, parental income, and high school GPA who have selected athletics may nonetheless be different from those who have not selected athletics, in ways that influence academic performance.  As Lieberson puts the point, \"quasi-experimental research almost inevitably runs into a profound selectivity issue\" (41).There is lots more careful, rigorous analysis of social-science reasoning in the book.  Lieberson crosses over between statistical methodology and philosophy of social science in a very useful way, and what is most fundamental is his insistence that we need to substantially rethink the assumptions we make in assigning causal influence on the basis of social variation."}, {"title": "Education choices and personal futures", "date": "Tuesday, June 17, 2008", "text": "Why do people pursue education -- whether through secondary school or through post-secondary school?It seems like a very simple question with an obvious answer: education adds to one's skills and productivity; these enhanced skills make one more attractive in the employment market; and therefore, pursuing education is a rational investment in future lifetime earnings.  (The economic impact of post-secondary education has been estimated to be at least one million dollars in additional earnings for the baccalaureate graduate over the high school graduate in the United States.)  In other words, the simple answer appears to be that people make rational decisions about their investments in training and education, and they see the financial advantage that can be expected by having completed a degree program.  More education is a valuable investment in future income, security, and status.Caption: % of high school graduates aged 25-29 who have received bachelor's degreeSource: National Center for Educational Statistics (link)However, this answer stimulates quite a few difficult questions.  Most fundamentally -- how are we to make sense of the behavior of the people who do not make this choice?  The chart posted above indicates that in the United States, less than 30% of 25-29 year-olds have completed a four-year college or university degree -- and this percentage has only risen from 22% to 26% from 1971 to 1995.  Moreover, this statistic does not include high school dropouts.  So if more education is so plainly a rational investment, why is there such a low participation rate in the United States?  Why do so many teenagers drop out of high school?  (A recent study estimates that the drop-out rate in the Detroit public schools exceeds 50%, with some estimates going as high as 78%.)  Why do many high school graduates choose not to apply to colleges or universities?  (Only 36% of adults between 18-24 in the United States are enrolled in college or graduate school; Institute for Higher Education Policy report.)  And why do under-educated but qualified young adults choose not to return to colleges or universities to complete their degrees?  (In southeast Michigan, for example, there are more than 150,000 young adults between 25-34 who have completed some college courses but have not earned a degree.)  So what are we to make of this evidence of dropping out, non-attending, and non-continuing?Here are a few answers that have been proposed: some people lack the ability (or believe so) to complete their educations; some people lack the discipline to work hard today for a benefit that will only materialize in the distant future; some people lack the confidence that the normal opportunities that await university graduates will be available for them (because of racial discrimination or recession, for example); some people simply don't think clearly about their current choices -- they don't plan well for the future; and, perhaps, some people are not strongly motivated by material incentives (income, career advancement).Most of these explanations make sense of the behavior by re-describing the terms of the choice -- thereby making the observed behavior \"rational in the circumstances\"; or they explain the behavior by referring to \"failures of rationality\" -- weakness of the will, miscalculation, indifference to future benefits.  (Jon Elster's work has often focused on these sorts of failures; Ulysses and the Sirens: Studies in Rationality and Irrationality.)  But these explanations don't seem sufficient; they appear to dissolve the problem rather than explain it.A second type of explanation of these social behaviors is one based on analysis of structural barriers to educational completion: poor schooling at earlier levels, racial or ethnic discrimination in the provision of educational opportunities, or economic obstacles to continuing education (tuition and the need to work fulltime), for example.   To these structural barriers some social psychologists have added the factor of discouragement created in young people by ethnic, racial, or gendered stereotypes about performance.  An important example here is found in Claude Steele's important work on \"stereotype threat\" and the major effects on performance that can be documented as deriving from stereotyped expectations.  (Steele describes some of his hypotheses and findings in this Frontline interview.)To these rational and structural factors, though, it seems relevant to ask whether there are also cultural expectations and community values that underlie the choices made by young people in various communities concerning education.  There is the idea, for example, that midwestern manufacturing regions had developed a culture of complacency about education created by the availability of well-paid manufacturing jobs in the 1950s-70s.  The easy availability of manufacturing work that required only a high school education led families to believe that their children didn't need good educations in order to succeed in the world of work they would be entering.  This set of expectations, it is argued, led to a familial attitude that guided young people towards choices that gave little importance to advanced education -- and, for that matter, little attention to the importance of strong performance in K-12 schooling -- a kind of \"Beach Boys\" mentality (cars, parties, fun).  It would be interesting to know what attitudes towards higher education are found in Appalachian mining communities -- is a college education valued by most families as a key ingredient of a good future, or is college education regarded as something foreign and unnecessary?  And it seems that there is an opportunity for some good anthropological research on the Latino communities of the United States to help explain why high school completion rates and college attendance are lower than in other struggling communities in the United States.So the question here is an important one: are there cultural values that work against placing a high value on educational attainment? What steps can be taken to mitigate these forces?  And how do cultural, structural, and familial factors interact to give rise to low educational aspirations for a sizable percentage of the American youth cohort?(I would like to see comparable statistics for Germany, France, and Australia.  Any good sources out there?)"}, {"title": "Cognizing society", "date": "Monday, June 16, 2008", "text": "\"Society\" is a large abstract whole -- more abstract, really, than \"nature\". We as social beings perceive very little of this whole directly, though we do perceive fairly directly many local social facts, social interactions, and social relations.  We are often astute readers of the social situations around us -- what our students may be expressing with their ironic looks during a lecture, what the car mechanic may be thinking about the clueless car owner with bad brakes, or what is likely to happen when it is announced that 15 percent of employees will be laid off in our company.  So we have lots of social knowledge.  But our knowledge and experience of \"society\" are highly partial and local.  Many aspects of the social world are invisible to me as a specific, situated person -- because they are remote from me spatially (I don't know how farmers behave with each other in the Oklahoma Panhandle), because they are outside my realm culturally or socially (I don't know how homeless people cope with illness), and possibly because they do not fit easily into the categories of understanding that I bring to my perceptions.  (If I have not been exposed to abusive behavior by police in impoverished neighborhoods, I may not perceive the threatening body language of a group of police officers as they move through a crowded neighborhood.)This is for me a large part of the fascination of the topics raised in this blog, UnderstandingSociety. Most postings here are concerned with how we perceive social affairs; how we organize these perceptions into representations of larger social constructs; and how we attempt to make sense of what we perceive and organize -- that is, how we understand the social world that we inhabit.  And these are problems for observers at every level -- social science experts, social policy designers, and ordinary people.Much of this description has as much to do with ordinary people making sense of their social world as with social scientists constructing complex theories and explanations of the social world. But this is appropriate, because I don't think there is a difference in kind between the two kinds of social cognition. Or rather, there is a difference between ordinary perception of society and social science; but it is a difference of degree of rigor about evidence and hypothesis rather than a difference in the nature of the representations and inferences that either ordinary people or scientists arrive at.(Whereas one might make a case for holding that everyday \"physics\" is different in principle from mathematical and theoretical physics. Folk social knowledge is closer to official social science than folk knowledge of nature is to physics.)So what are some of the aspects of social life that people observe directly? Take some of the fundamentals: family relations, race relations, or economic relations. Marie, a maid in a luxury hotel, has a perspective of several of these social categories. She has a very direct perspective on the employment relation -- she is poorly paid, her supervisors are rough and disrespectful, and maybe she is subjected to a degree of sexual harassment on the job as well.  (The nature of experience at this level of society is one of the interesting things we can learn from Barbara Ehrenreich's book, Nickel and Dimed: On (Not) Getting By in America). Marie also has an interesting perspective on class relations in our society -- the comings and goings of the affluent, some of their values, how they dress, and the ways that they treat people outside their circles.  Further, since the imagined Marie is Haitian, she also has a perspective on race, culture, and ethnicity in America.  And, if she is a thoughtful observer, she may well have organized these observations into some \"theories\" or mental frameworks about how capitalism works, how racial discrimination works, how class and status serve to structure interpersonal relations in places like restaurants or hotels, and what America is like.  In other words, this maid is an active observer and interpreter of social structures, social behaviors, and social relations.What is the epistemic status of Marie's theories?  We've already noticed two important features: first, her theories are derived from her own experience and observations; and second, they are partial and perspective-bound.  The first point provides a basis for thinking that these theories are empirically grounded and worthy of attention.  And the second point pretty much assures that they aren't completely \"true\".  What looks like racial discrimination or condescension in the behavior of some of the guests may be something more complicated. Race relations in a factory may have a different feel and structure than race relations in a hotel.  And it may be that Marie's theories about what is happening are pretty accurate concerning her local workplace, but her theories about how and why this is happening may be wildly wrong.In other words, Marie's representations, based on observation and experience, are an important input into a somewhat more comprehensive sociology of work, race and class.  The more comprehensive treatment ought to consider the experiences and cognitions on these subjects of a wide range of people -- architects, taxi drivers, engineers, transit workers, and public school teachers, for example.  And it ought to consider some of the mechanisms and structures through which these lived experiences are generated and inter-connected -- the mechanisms of race, the structures of urban poverty, or the dynamics of discrimination in the professional workplace, for example.One way of taking these observations in the direction of constructing a more complete effort at \"cognizing\" society is perhaps not quite right, but it is intriguing.  It is the idea that one component of a \"sociology of the present\" might be an enormous \"wiki\" of lived experience, in which participants throughout society and at every level offer their perspectives on the nature of the social relations in which they operate and their hypotheses about how these connect to more distant social institutions.  (The realist novels of Emile Zola -- The Fortune of the Rougons and dozens of other novels in a chronological series about this hypothetical family -- sound a bit like this in their nuanced depiction of the experiences of people of all classes in 19th century France.)  What this comprehensive wiki of social life would not provide, is an organized set of ideas about social causation and structure -- about why and how the patterns that are revealed come about."}, {"title": "Components of positivism", "date": "Thursday, June 12, 2008", "text": "Many of us agree that \"positivist\" social science isn't a good idea.  But what is encompassed by \"positivism\" in this setting?First, the favorable part of the story: positivism puts forward two ideas about conceptual clarity and empirical rigor that surely need to be a part of any intellectually sound effort to understand society, or to contribute to social science.  Our concepts need to make sense (by some criterion of sense-making), and our assertions need to be supportable by some combination of empirical evidence and logical inference.  These amount simply to the requirement that science should be rationally articulated and rationally justified.  These are aspects of the epistemology of science advanced by the progenitors of positivism -- for example, Mill, Comte, the Vienna Circle, Schlick, Carnap, Hempel -- that  I, for one, do accept.  And if this were the full extent of positivism, then it would be hard to be anti-positivist.But positivist social science makes several additional assumptions about social knowledge that are untenable, in my view.First is naturalism -- the idea that the social and behavioral sciences should have the same structure and logical characteristics as the natural sciences.  Chemistry and physics -- especially the classical versions of these sciences -- have a unified hypothetico-deductive structure; they discover laws of nature; and they derive the observable features of the domains of phenomena they encompass.  Naturalism postulates, therefore, that sociology, economics, or psychology should have the same logical structure, because that is what \"science\" requires. John Stuart Mill clearly presupposed this assumption in his discussion of the \"moral sciences.\"Second, relatedly, is the unity of science -- the idea that ultimately all scientific theories should be subsumable under one \"most fundamental\" master theory.  This assumption brings with it the idea of reductionism; higher-level sciences (psychology) should be reducible to lower-level sciences (neurophysiology).  And \"reducible\" means \"derivable from given suitable bridge definitions and laws\".  (This topic was central for the Vienna Circle logical positivists.)Third is an assumption about methodology, to the effect that measurement and quantification are essential aspects of scientific knowledge.  So quantitative statements and theories are preferable to qualitative or descriptive statements; and the goal of a social science should be to discover a set of variables within the domain of investigation that can be observed, measured, and counted.   This is a different aspect of the unity-of-science doctrine: the idea that there should be one privileged method of discovery and presentation for the social sciences.  Where does this assumption come from?  In part, it seems to derive from the physics-envy associated with naturalism; but perhaps there is also a Platonic dimension as well -- a preference for mathematics over descriptive or interpretive language.Fourth is an assumption about explanation, regularities, and laws.  The assumption here is that explanation requires the discovery of law-like generalizations about the domain of phenomena encompassed by the scientific field.  This assumption has two components: the idea that a well-defined domain of investigation must somehow embody a set of regularities, perhaps disguised by the noise; and second, that explanations within the domain of individual events or patterns of events must take the form of a derivation of the explanandum from the general laws mentioned in the explanans.  Carl Hempel and J.S. Mill agree about this premise.Fifth is an assumption about causation -- that causation is a feature of statistical relationships among variables rather than a feature involving causal necessity or causal mechanisms.  This is a Humean approach to causation, and it leads positivist social scientists to restrict their attention to causal regularities rather than looking for real causal mechanisms.Finally, there is a sixth premise that has also created debate but seems less intrusive to the practice of innovative social science -- the insistence on the fact-value distinction.  \"Positive\" science has to do with the discovery of facts, whereas ethics or policy stidies have to do with values.Do these assumptions necessarily travel together?  Not necessarily, though there are some internal logical connections among them that make it more difficult to imagine them standing completely independently.  But it appears to be a characteristic of the observed sociology of science for an important stream of twentieth-century social science research, that these features are clustered together.  And many critics argue that these assumptions have created blinders for social-science researchers, limiting their originality in theories, concepts, and explanations of the social world.Critics of positivist social science ask us to consider a broader space of possibilities for research and theory formation in the social sciences.  Taking the premise of scientific rationality as a given, what would a philosophy of social science look like that questioned the other premises on this list?  What is a \"post-positivist realism\" for the social sciences?It is realist about causation; it affirms the scientific validity of seeking for real social mechanisms.  It advocates for a conception of scientific explanation that hinges on the discovery of real causal connections among features of the social world.  It is pluralistic about method; it acknowledges that there are multiple rationally supportable methods of inquiry in the social sciences, and multiple forms that social-science knowledge can take.  It is even-handed among quantitative, qualitative, comparative, and narrative approaches to social inquiry and social explanation.  It is anti-reductionist and anti-naturalistic: it does not presuppose that various areas of the social sciences should be reducible to some other, more fundamental scientific theory; and it does not presuppose that the social sciences should resemble the natural sciences.  And, finally, it is fully committed to the positive features of rationality that were mentioned above: the scientific virtues of conceptual clarity and empirical-rational justification for scientific beliefs.This set of alternatives opens up the space of the social sciences quite dramatically; it permits a wide and pluralistic range of inquiries to proceed, without the requirement of theoretical or methodological unity.  And this frees researchers to arrive at accounts of their domains of research that are well suited to the particulars of these domains.In a later posting I will come back to an important contribution to this debate, George Steinmetz's The Politics of Method in the Human Sciences: Positivism and Its Epistemological Others.Chuck Tilly's influence extended to many areas of world history.  Visit this posting on TheChinaBeat for some reflections on Chuck's influence on the China field.From China Beat, 6/11/2008:By Daniel LittleCharles Tilly (\u201cChuck\u201d to his friends and colleagues) was one of the world\u2019s most influential social scientists, and his impact on Chinese studies will be long-lasting. His death on April 29, 2008, was a sad loss for many scholarly communities as well as for his friends and family. (See the SSRC\u00a0memorial page, which includes a series of remembrances about Tilly. Chuck talks in fascinating detail about the evolution of his thinking in a video\u00a0interview\u00a0I conducted with him in December 2007.) Tilly was a comparative historical sociologist with a primary interest in French contentious politics, and his writings have had deep impact on several generations of scholars. He helped to define much of the theoretical vocabulary that scholars use to frame their theories and hypotheses about social change, contentious politics, and state formation. The central focus of his empirical and historical research was on France, with important and illuminating treatments of revolution, counter-revolution, popular politics, and mobilization from the Revolution to the Paris uprising of 1968.(Ed Note: If you would like to see more video like that above, there are seven additional parts to this interview, which you can view at YouTube by followingthis link.)Chuck was often immersed in the historical specificities of French politics; but his mind always turned to theorizing and conceptualizing the circumstances he studied. And this meant that all of world history was of interest to Chuck. In particular, Chuck paid close attention to the recent literature in Chinese history. Astute references to current research on China can be found throughout many of his later books, including\u00a0The Politics of Collective Violence. He was always most interested in discovering the \u201cwhy\u201d of the events that he observed \u2013 and how these \u201cwhy\u2019s\u201d might be portable into other historical settings as well. (One of his last books carried the simple title,\u00a0Why?.) This is what marked him as a comparative historical sociologist, rather than an historian using the tools of the social sciences. He wanted to understand what explained the course of the large processes he studied, and he felt this was most achievable through comparison across cases. Another title of Chuck\u2019s puts the point vividly:\u00a0Big Structures, Large Processes, Huge Comparisons. Here Chuck signals his theoretical interests: discovering the \u201chow and why\u201d of large social processes, and discovering what we can learn about social processes through careful comparison across settings.A very important development in Tilly\u2019s thought was the turn to causal mechanisms rather than social generalizations as the foundation of explanations of large social outcomes and processes -- things like social contention, civil war, or revolution. Doug McAdam, Sidney Tarrow, and Charles Tilly worked out the details of this view in\u00a0Dynamics of Contention. They argue that explanations of large social outcomes should be constructed by discovering the specific causal mechanisms present in the cases, rather than hoping to find a few high-level generalizations about \u201cthe causes of civil wars\u201d or \u201cgeneral laws of ethnic violence.\u201d And, it turns out, the idea of historical change as a concatenation of a number of social mechanisms is particularly useful in coming to grips with Chinese history.Chuck\u2019s central historical contributions were to European studies. So what does all this have to do with the China field? Quite a bit, it turns out. Chuck exercised a deep level of influence over a number of important strands of research in Chinese history and historical sociology. His thinking worked its way deeply into the intellectual \u201cDNA\u201d of young researchers in many fields of history and the social sciences in the 1970s and 1980s \u2013 with the result that his influence can be seen across the range of world histories, including Asian history, Latin American history, and African history.This occurred through several pathways. First, Chuck\u2019s personal influence on graduate students at Michigan, the New School, and Columbia was enormous. The Center for Research on Social Organization at Michigan was a hotbed of innovative thinking about social research and historical comparison; and the style of thinking that the Center encouraged subsequently migrated to many areas of world history and many other institutions. Second, the fertility and innovativeness of his thinking was a constant source of influence for others, and he certainly stimulated new conceptual approaches to important problems in Chinese history. And finally, Chuck\u2019s writings were prolific, assuring him of a wide sphere of influence. More than fifty books and more articles that one can reasonably count assured that his ideas would have wide currency.There are several specific areas in Chinese history where Chuck\u2019s intellectual DNA seems particularly evident. Take the emphasis on historical comparison that was so central to Chuck\u2019s work and worldview. A particularly fertile development in China studies in the past two decades is a new approach to large-scale comparison \u2013 new ways of thinking about how to compare the large developments of Western Europe and China, with regard both to political institutions and economic development. R. Bin Wong\u2019s\u00a0China Transformed\u00a0sets the table for Eurasian comparisons in a new way. He urges us to compare the large economic and political development processes of Europe and China, without the blinkers of the Eurocentric assumptions that previous generations of economic historians have carried. This is an approach that is highly consonant with Tilly\u2019s appetite for comparison and for fresh thinking about the ways in which we characterize those alternative experiences. Significantly, Bin Wong was an undergraduate student and a Junior Fellow at the University of Michigan, and he was influenced by Chuck at a very early stage. Ken Pomeranz\u2019s\u00a0Great Divergence\u00a0pursues a similar intellectual agenda. Pomeranz too is committed to providing new and more nuanced comparisons between Europe and China, and the breadth and subtlety of his analysis, and his facility in using categories of social theory to frame the narrative, are very reminiscent of Tilly\u2019s thought.This kind of comparative work across Eurasia is also at the heart of the work of historical demographers such as James Lee, Cameron Campbell, and Tommy Bengtsson. In\u00a0Life under Pressure\u00a0and later volumes the collaborative team of researchers involved in the Eurasian Population and Family History Project take the challenge of comparison very seriously, and attempt to identify patterns of fertility, mortality, and health across dozens of micro-communities across the expanse of Eurasia. This is a kind of historical research that incorporates several features that Tilly\u2019s work highlights: careful quantitative analysis, attention to local details, comparison across different historical settings, and a rigorous effort to bring data and theory into one narrative. Significantly, James Lee too was a Junior Fellow at the University of Michigan and was affiliated with the Center during 1980 and 1981.Or take the infusion of good social analysis and theory into detailed historical research in the hands of scholars such as Peter Perdue in\u00a0China Marches West. Peter was among the graduate students in Chinese history in the 1970s who were most directly influenced by the idea that good historical research needs to be informed by good social science thinking \u2013 and Chuck Tilly was one of those thinkers who wielded great influence on this generation. Peter took a year\u2019s leave from his Harvard Ph.D. program to study with Tilly at Michigan, and the influence is apparent. For example, Peter takes up Tilly\u2019s theories about state formation in his own effort to place a theoretical framework around the fluid dynamics of Russia, Qing China, and the inner Asian polities in\u00a0China Marches West. \u201cTilly\u2019s model, then, although it does not focus on China or on frontiers, helps to orient our discussion toward the interplay of military and commercial forces during the time of Qing expansion. Military considerations were primary, but not exclusive, in defining the empire\u2019s identity\u201d (530). Peter\u2019s emphasis on the contingency of the developments that he describes in Central Asia is very important, and is also very suggestive of Chuck\u2019s way of looking at historical change. Tilly\u2019s work served to provide new questions for Chinese historians and new conceptual frameworks within which to attempt to explain the large processes of change that they were analyzing. State-formation, taxation, military provisioning, and popular politics were themes and theories that Tilly\u2019s work helped to frame within recent work in Chinese history.And, of course, there is the vital area of peasant politics. Chuck helped to highlight the central role that contention and popular politics plays in world history, from the local to the national to the global. And he was consistently fascinated by the particular processes and repertoires through which discontent turned into coordinated collective action. These topics are centrally important in Chinese history \u2013 whether we are thinking of peasant rebellions in the Qing or of environment protests in China today. Elizabeth Perry was herself a participant in the contentious politics project involving Tilly, McAdam, Tarrow, Goldstone, Aminzade, Sewell, and others, and her sustained work on collective action and peasant politics both contributed to and drew upon many insights in this fertile collaboration. One fruit of this collaboration is the edited volume,Silence and Voice in the Study of Contentious Politics, edited by Ronald Aminzade, Jack Goldstone, Doug McAdam, Elizabeth J. Perry, William H. Sewell, Sidney Tarrow, and Charles Tilly; the preface describes the origins and course of the collaborative project. Also relevant is her essay, \"Collective Violence in China, 1880-1980: The State and Local Society,\"\u00a0Theory and Society\u00a013:3 (May 1984).Kevin O\u2019Brien\u2019s brilliant formulations (often with Li Liangjiang) of new ways of thinking about \u201crightful resistance\u201d in China today owe much to Tilly (and to James Scott, another fertile thinker in the social science arsenal). O\u2019Brien and Li\u2019s analysis in\u00a0Rightful Resistance in Rural China\u00a0also makes extensive use of the most recent turn in Tilly\u2019s thinking about contention, his emphasis on the social mechanisms of contention. Other historians and sociologists who have focused on popular politics in China similarly show the influence of Tilly, either directly or indirectly.When Joseph Esherick and Jeffrey Wasserstrom consider the \u201cpolitical theater\u201d of 1989 (\u201cActing Out Democracy\u201d in\u00a0Popular Protest and Political Culture in Modern China), they think of Tilly\u2019s concept of repertoires of contention (36). And later in the essay their effort to place the \u201ctheater\u201d of 1989 in a comparative perspective and in the context of the institutions of civil society within which the contention took place is very consistent with Tilly\u2019s framework and style of approach.C. K. Lee is another genuinely gifted sociologist with a central interest in protest and mobilization (Against the Law: Labor Protests in China\u2019s Rustbelt and Sunbelt). She doesn\u2019t refer frequently to Tilly, but the way that she lays out the problem seems to me to reflect many of the mental frameworks for analyzing contention that Chuck advanced throughout his career. What this seems to show is that the conceptual frameworks for how to think about contentious politics that Tilly constructed throughout his career have percolated through the China field, and that younger scholars are now pushing those ideas further in directions Chuck could not have anticipated but would have appreciated greatly.I am sure that this thumbnail accounting leaves out important ways in which Tilly has influenced the China field. In fact, if Chuck himself had taken on this question \u2013 how did one thinker\u2019s ideas spread their influence over several other fields of research? \u2013 I am sure he would have come up with a smart way of tracking and observing the influence. And of course the forms of influence that I have highlighted here do not detract at all from the originality and innovativeness of these scholars. But I think the central point is clear: Chuck Tilly established new ways of looking at the landscape of large social change; he posed a new set of questions about power, coercion, and contention in the give and take of human history-making; and he laid out an extensive vision of historical process that has been deeply influential on historians in every field. Chinese history faces a huge range of challenges, and innovative thinking about how to understand social change and social persistence is crucial. Chuck Tilly\u2019s fertile sociological imagination has added much to this field, and has much still to offer."}, {"title": "Wittgenstein and \"understanding society\"", "date": "Tuesday, June 10, 2008", "text": "Does Wittgenstein's philosophy in the Philosophical Investigations have anything distinctive to add to better ways of understanding society? And is there anything in Wittgenstein's philosophy that contributes to the philosophy of social science?  (These are different questions, even though they seem to be closely related; the first question is conceptual or ontological, whereas the second is epistemological and methodological.)There are some reasons for expecting that Wittgenstein's later writings are in fact relevant to non-routinized thinking about the social world -- perhaps in ways that have not been highlighted in existing discussions of his thought.   For example -- his understanding of language as a deeply social product; his criticism of naive ideas about \"meaning\" in language; his idea of language games; his critical discussions of \"following a rule\"; his thoughts about the interpretation of behavior; his idea of a set of social practices setting a context for action and meaning; his notion that learning a language is learning a way of life; ... -- all these threads have some suggestive implications for how to think about social behavior and the social world.These questions have been raised before, of course; most famously, by Peter Winch in The Idea of a Social Science and Its Relation to Philosophy.  Winch's main line is to insist on an anti-positivist grounding for social \"science\", and to offer a determined critique of the idea that the social sciences should resemble the natural sciences.  Instead, Winch argues that the social sciences should model themselves on philosophy.  He pays a great deal of attention to the question of defining action and rationality, and in \"Understanding a Primitive Society\" (American Philosophical Quarterly 1964), he brings in the anthropological descriptions of Evans-Pritchard and other anthropologists who emphasize the radical differences that apparently exist across conceptual systems (magic, rationality, ...).  This is probably the most celebrated effort to link Wittgenstein's thought to the social sciences, but I'm not sure it adds much to the conversation today.But another very interesting effort that takes off from Wittgenstein's philosophy and tries to draw out some implications for social philosophy is Hanna Pitkin's Wittgenstein and Justice: On the Significance of Ludwig Wittgenstein for Social and Political Thought.  This is a truly valuable and original book, and well worth working through.  Pitkin's central goal is to make a contribution to the foundations of political theory by thinking carefully about Wittgenstein's philosophy of language and behavior.  (A lot of her work here is inspired by Stanley Cavell's readings of the Investigations.)  Here is how she begins:It is by no means obvious that someone interested in politics and society needs to concern himself with philosophy; nor that, in particular, he has anything to learn from an obscure, misanthropic, enigmatic philosopher like Ludwig Wittgenstein, who never wrote about such topics at all.  Wittgenstein's interests were philosophy itself, language, and the relationship between the two.   Yet his investigations can yield insights of the most fundamental significance for social science or political theory....  What he has to offer is something like a new perspective, a new way of seeing what has always been visible, what has gone unnoticed precisely because of its familiarity. (1)This book is genuinely original, and Pitkin makes a whole series of connections between Wittgenstein's thought and some difficult problems in the definition of political theory.So there are some existing efforts to connect Wittgenstein's thought to the challenge of understanding society.  But let's ask the question anew: is there anything in Wittgenstein's philosophy that is a fertile source of ideas for analyzing, conceptualizing, imagining, and explaining society?I don't think that Wittgenstein has much to offer on the subject of the methodology or epistemology of social knowledge -- how we acquire and justify beliefs about society.  Wittgenstein wasn't much interested in the question of empirical justification of belief, and I don't think he was especially receptive to the effort to create a rigorous philosophy of science that was the primary task of Vienna Circle philosophy.  If anything, this task lines up better with Wittgenstein's thinking in Tractatus Logico Philosophicus, but it doesn't resonate with the Investigations.But I'm more intrigued by the notion that there may be pervasive metaphors and mental frameworks in Wittgenstein's writings that offer a different way of thinking about social behavior and social interaction. That is, there may be a fragmentary social ontology in Wittgenstein's thought that pushes new thinking.  So a question worth posing is this: does Wittgenstein provide any new insights about how to characterize or understand social world?  And I'm inclined to think that he does -- for example, in the form of his ideas about rule-following, social practices, family-resemblance concepts, and understanding other minds.Perhaps most immediate contribution is Wittgenstein's emphasis on social practices and his umbrella concept of \"forms of life\" as a totality of practices, regularities, bodily circumstances, and rules within which we behave.  Pitkin describes the concept of \"forms of life\" this way:That notion is never explicitly defined, and we should not try to force more precision from it than its rich suggestiveness will bear.  but its general significance is clear enough: human life as we live and observe it is not just a random, continuous flow, but displays recurrent patterns, regularities, characteristic ways of doing and being, of feeling and acting, of speaking and interacting. Because they are patterns, regularities, configurations, Wittgenstein calls them forms; and because they are patterns in the fabric of human existence and activity on earth, he calls them forms of life.  The idea is clearly related to the idea of a language game, and more generally to Wittgenstein's action-oriented view of language.  \"The speaking of language, he says, \"is part of an activity, or of a form of life.\" (132)To me, anyway, this is an important idea; it provides a different way of locating individuals and their subjectivity within a broader social, inter-subjective context.  Neither individual nor collectivity is privileged; instead, we have a conception of a mutual \"society-making\" through the intentional and oriented actions and thoughts of multiple social beings.  We can ask whether this concept bears any relation to the idea of a mentalit\u00e9 (discussed in a previous posting).  And we can ask -- does Wittgenstein imagine one form of life or many, corresponding to the circumstances of different historical and cultural settings.  Answering this question goes a way towards deciding whether we need a single social science or multiple ethnographies.Another line of thought is also helpful: Wittgenstein's deep critique of the search for philosophically simple theories (of meanings, concepts, or theories); and in place of logically simple analysis, his suggestion of social life as an overlapping set of practices and uses with no underlying essence. This is the most obvious contrast between the Tractatus and the Investigations; the former tries to give a single, logically austere definition of language and meaning; whereas the latter understands language more along the lines of an old, medieval city, with criss-crossing layers and paths -- a messy, complex, and somewhat contradictory reality.  (Pitkin suggests this in highlighting the contrast between Roman-law and common-law systems; the former proceed on the basis of logically articulated principles, and the latter on the basis of overlapping and sometimes contradictory precedents; 50.)There are probably another half-dozen threads and metaphors that could be highlighted as well.So there probably are new insights to be gained from Wittgenstein about society.  It is worthwhile to do a careful re-reading of the Investigations with a fresh set of eyes: what is the framework of thought in terms of which Wittgenstein thinks about social relations, social interpretation, and social action? How can some of these ideas give us some new insights into the task of framing an adequate social science?  And how would some central tenets of current philosophy of social science look when treated from the point of view of the Investigations?"}, {"title": "Trust and corruption", "date": "Monday, June 9, 2008", "text": "The recent collapse of a major skyscraper crane in New York City last month led to a surprising result: the arrest of the city's chief crane inspector on charges of bribery.  (See the New York Times story here.)  (The story indicates that the facts surrounding the charges are unrelated to this particular crane collapse.)  Several weeks earlier, a Congressional committee heard testimony from three F.A.A. inspectors to the effect that the agency had permitted Southwest Airlines to fly uninspected planes (story), and some attributed this lapse to too cozy a relationship between the F.A.A. and the airline industry:The F.A.A.\u2019s watchdog role, to many Democrats in Congress who now oversee airline regulators, grew toothless. \u201cWe had drifted a little bit too much toward the over-closeness and coziness between regulator and regulated,\u201d said H. Clayton Foushee Jr., a former F.A.A. official who led a recent inquiry by Mr. Oberstar\u2019s committee. (story)The basic systems of a complex society depend upon the good-faith commitment of providers to give top priority to safety, health, and quality, but they also depend upon regulation, inspection, and certification.    Caveat emptor doesn't work when it comes to airline travel or working in a skyscraper; we simply have to trust that the airliner or the building is built and maintained to a high level of safety standards.  The food we eat, the restaurants we patronize, the airlines and railroads we travel on, and the buildings we live and work in (and send our children to) provide complex products for our use that we can't independently evaluate.  Instead, we are obliged to trust the providers -- the builders, the airline companies and their pilots and mechanics, the restaurant operators -- and the regulatory and inspection regimes that are intended to provide an assurance of quality, safety, and health.And yet there are two imperatives that work against public health and safety in most modern societies: the private incentive that the provider has to cut corners, and the perennial temptation of corruption that is inherent within a regulatory process.  On the providers' side, there is a constant business incentive to lower costs by substituting inferior ingredients or materials, to tolerate less-than-sanitary conditions in the back-of-restaurant areas, or to skimp on necessary maintenance of inherently dangerous systems.  And on the regulatory side, there is the omnipresent possibility of collusion between inspectors and providers.  Inspectors have it in their power to impose costs or savings on providers; so the provider has an economic interest in making payments to inspectors to save themselves these costs.  (See Robert Klitgaard's fascinating book, Controlling Corruption, for a political scientist's analysis of this problem.)In a purely laissez-faire environment we would expect there to be recurring instances of health and safety disasters in food production, building construction, transportation, and the healthcare system; this seems to be the logical result of a purely cost- and profit-driven system of production.  (This seems to be what lies at the heart of the Chinese pet food and toy product scandals of several months ago, and it was at the heart of the food industries chronicled by Upton Sinclair a century ago in this country.)But an inadequate system of regulation and enforcement seems equally likely to lead to health and safety crises for society, if inspection regimes are inadequate or if inspectors are corrupt.  The two stories about inspection mentioned above point to different ways in which a regulatory system can go wrong: individual inspectors can be corrupted, or honest inspectors can be improperly managed by their regulatory organization. And, of course, there is a third possibility as well: the regulatory system may be fully honest and well-managed but wholly insufficient to the task presented to it in terms of the resources and personnel devoted to the regulatory task.These two tendencies appear to be resulting in major social problems in China today. There is little confidence in the Chinese public in building standards in even the major civil engineering projects that the country has undertaken in the past ten years (CNN story, BBC story), there is widespread concern about corruption in many aspects of ordinary life, and there is growing concern among consumers about the safety of the system of food production, public water sources, and pharmaceuticals (story).  (The anger and anguish expressed by parents whose children were lost in collapsed schools in Sichuan appear to derive from these kinds of mistrust.)  So one of China's major challenges for the coming years is to create credible, effective, and trusted regulatory regimes for the areas of public life that most directly affect health and safety.But the stories mentioned above don't have to do with China, or India, or Brazil; they have to do with the United States.  We have lived through a period of determined deregulation since 1980, and have been subjected to a political ideology that minimized and demeaned the role of government in protecting the health and safety of the public -- in banking no less than air safety.  It seems very pressing for us now to ask ourselves: how effective are the systems of regulation and inspection that we have in our key industries -- food, pharmaceuticals, hospitals, transportation, and construction?  How much confidence can we have in the basis health and safety features of these fundamental social goods?  And what sorts of institutional reforms do we need to undertake?"}, {"title": "The professions as an object of study", "date": "Sunday, June 8, 2008", "text": "Several gifted sociologists over the past thirty years have made innovative contributions to the study of the \"sociology of professions.\"  Most recent among these is Andrew Abbott, whose book, The System of Professions: An Essay on the Division of Expert Labor, is a superlative contribution to sociological theory formation. Abbott has also given attention to one profession in particular, university faculty, in two other interesting books, Chaos of Disciplines\u00a0and Department and Discipline: Chicago Sociology at One Hundred.  Earlier contributions to the study of professions include books by Mayer Zald, including Occupations and organizations in American society: The organization-dominated man?, The correctional institution for juvenile offenders: An analysis of organizational \"character\", and his first book, YMCA in Atlanta: Environment and adaptation.  (As the titles indicate, Zald's interests cross over between professions and organizations; but the two are plainly linked.)Examples of professions that are considered by Abbott and Zald include psychiatrists, social workers, accountants, physicians, professors, and pharmacists.  And I suppose we might extend the list quite a bit, to include journalists, lawyers, real estate agents, university presidents, property assessors, architects, clergy, and engineers.  But what about more borderline examples: skilled auto mechanics, sculptors, acupuncturists, necromancers, landscapers, and tarot card readers?  And how about corporate executives, bankers, skilled pickpockets, and pirates?  We know what a professional opera singer is: it is a person who can earn her living in this career.  But is an opera singer a \"professional\" in the relevant sense?  What is a \"professional\", anyway?  What are the relationships among profession, occupation, skill, expertise, income, work, prestige, and credential?  And how is this a sociological question?As the examples suggest, there are several dimensions of qualification that we might intuitively consider to define the concept of \"professional\".  Is it a person who earns his/her living by exercising a skill or talent?  Is it a person who has had formal training in a high-prestige type of work?  Is it a person who is credentialed by a recognized credentialing agency?  Is it a person who is tagged with the social label \"professional\" by other people in his/her society?  Or is it a person who is a member of an organization of people doing the same kind of work?We might suppose that the concept of \"professional\" is an overlap concept that involves the intersection of skill, knowledge, credential, association, and prestige -- with the implication that there are members of society who have several of these features but not others, and are therefore not regarded as \"professionals\".Notice that these are all conceptual questions; they have to do with how we choose to define a certain category of social action and actor.  Here we have quite a bit of choice -- though we want our definition of \"professional\" to have some relationship to ordinary usage.  This brings the idea of the social construction of social categories into play; for example, does it make sense to imagine that \"bare-foot doctors\" constituted a profession in revolutionary China, given the strong ideology of egalitarianism that was present?  Presumably bare-foot doctors were regarded as \"workers\", not professionals.Once we have clarified the concept -- that is, once we have delineated the domain of social behavior and action that falls under the concept of \"the professions\" -- we can then do specific empirical work.  The empirical work falls in many areas, and much of it depends on detailed studies of historical cases.  We can examine the training and schooling that is customarily associated with the profession of pharmacy or accounting at a particular point in time; we can trace out the multiple professional organizations and associations that existed for pharmacists or accountants in the 1920s; we can examine in detail the processes involved in accreditation and credentialing for the profession at a certain time; and we can observe the rising and falling fortunes of the professions over time, as they compete for space in the ecology of an existing social system.  (Abbott gives a lot of attention, for example, to the struggle between social workers and psychiatrists over the right to treat mentally ill patients.)The topic of training regimes and professional associations is particularly accessible to empirical study; the sociologist can dig into archives and discover quite a bit of concrete detail about the ways in which accountants or physicians were trained in 1920 and the ways in which they were credentialed by the relevant professional organizations.  They can consider the processes by which a segment of the skilled work force becomes \"professionalized.\"  And they can consider in detail the lobbying campaigns and public relations efforts conducted by professional organizations to retain certain skilled performances exclusively for their members.  (This is the jurisdictional question that is central in many studies of the professions.)Abbott's conceptual approach is signaled by the subtitle of his book: \"the division of expert labor.\"  He highlights abstract knowledge as the prime criterion of an area of skilled work constituting a profession: \"For abstraction is the quality that sets interprofessional competition apart from competition among occupations in general. Any occupation can obtain licensure (e.g., beauticians) or develop  ethics code (e.g., real estate). But only a knowledge system governed by abstractions can redefine its problems and tasks, defend them from interlopers, and seize new problems--as medicine has recently seized alcoholism, mental illness, hyperactivity in children, obesity, and numerous other things.  Abstraction enables survival in the competitive system of professions\" (8-9).  Expertise is an expression of abstract knowledge; and the possession of knowledge-based expertise is the result of formal training and the foundation of licensure.For Abbott, then, the sociology of the professions needs to focus on the systems through which the relevant forms of abstract knowledge are created; the educational systems through which pre-professionals acquire this knowledge; and the professional associations that oversee both education and current practice through their power of licensure.  These associations turn out to be potent social actors: through their leadership at a given point in time, they take actions designed to improve the profession and improve the social and economic environment for the profession in the future.  (This is the competitive part of the story mentioned above.)The other central sociological question that comes up in Abbott's treatment is the organizational one: how are the organizations of society arranged in such a way as to incorporate the specialized knowledge of the professions?  This takes us into consideration of hospitals, law firms, banks, and universities, and the intricate pathways of development through which each of these organizational forms have developed in the past century.  (This is also a point of contact with Zald's careful work on organizations such as the YMCA and social-service organizations.)I've dwelled on this precinct of sociology because it is one of the areas of sociological research that involves a fascinating mix of objective, case-based research and somewhat ephemeral social entities -- the profession of accountancy, the profession of medicine.  These are social \"things\" in some sense -- but they are highly abstract entities involving a constant change of personnel, standards, curricula, bodies of knowledge and expertise, and zones of jurisdiction.  As such, the study of professions seems to well illustrate a point that seems fundamental to me: that we need to understand the social world as a plastic, heterogeneous, and shifting range of activities, rather than as an ensemble of fixed social structures or entities.  The beauty of Abbott's work is his ability to give some definition to a reality that he fully recognizes to be in flux."}, {"title": "Is publicity an important source of power?", "date": "Friday, June 6, 2008", "text": "What is publicity in the sense intended here? It is shared public knowledge of a given state of affairs. It stands in contrast to secrecy and deception, and it is cognate to transparency. Public knowledge is shared knowledge. And philosophers such as Rawls and Habermas have given great moral importance to this circumstance of publicity within their conceptions of a good democratic society. The Internet, with its ubiquitous voices and constant growth, is a particularly salient embodiment of the idea of publicity. But is publicity a resource of power and influence for ordinary people?I begin with a simple observation: Powerful agencies in global society pursue their interests using the many forms of power available to them.  Corporations, states, and powerful individuals exercise various kinds of power over ordinary people and groups.  Coercion, deception, concealment, and intimidation rest in the portfolio of the powerful.  What forms of self-defense are available to ordinary people against the misuse of power through coercion, intimidation, or the corruption of other wielders of power?Amartya Sen's answer to a part of this question is a famous one.  He poses the question, why did major famine occur in post-Revolution China but not in post-Independence India?  And his answer is, the existence of electoral institutions and a free press in India but not in China.  The publicity of an emerging famine gave the Congress Party in India a major incentive to take steps that would prevent full-blown famine conditions. By contrast, the opacity of China and the non-accountable power of the Communist Party permitted the famine of the Great Leap Forward to continue through two harvest seasons and to accumulate to 20 to 30 million excess deaths.  Publicity and public accountability of government played a decisive role in the different experiences, according to Sen and his co-author, Jean Dr\u00e8ze (Hunger and Public Action).So, in suitable political circumstances, a free press involving independent investigative journalists can be a check on power, both in the hands of the state and for non-state actors.  (Several earlier posts comment on the limits of this mechanism in authoritarian states; see entries under the label repression.)What about the web and the blogosphere? Can these decentralized and non-official forms of publicity serve as an effective check on the abuse of power by the powerful?There are several reasons for thinking they can, but there are also several countervailing factors. On the positive side, the web provides a broad and diffuse platform through which people with concerns or grievances can express their ideas and observations. Web pages and blogs provide everyone with a platform from which to make a case and present evidence.  We can all be investigative journalists; we can all speak truth to power.  And thanks to the power of search engines, these voices aren't doomed to the oblivion of cacophony. People concerned about a particular issue can find each other and pool information. And they can coordinate their actions into organized collective action.  Whistle-blowers can publish their knowledge on the web -- often behind a screen of anonymity that protects them from retaliation.But we have to ask this question: to what extent does public knowledge of an abuse lead to effective actions or processes that remedy the abuse?  What social mechanisms transform public knowledge into power?  Sen's argument about famine identifies one such mechanism: voters care about famine, and parties or candidates who are known to be ineffective in response to famine will be unsuccessful at the polls.  So public opinion, energized by knowledge of disturbing facts, can lead to action by elected officials.  But this mechanism isn't available in all social settings or for all forms of bad behavior by powerful agencies, for several reasons. First, some forms of bad behavior by the powerful are largely outside the control of democratic processes -- for example, business practices.  Second, there are recognized strategies of \"spin control\" that allow bad actors to obscure their actions from public view. Finally, it is all too often that it is difficult to capture enough public attention to an abuse to gather a significant political force.  (Think about how relatively ineffective public knowledge and revulsion about the violence in Darfur has been; and think about how little effect public knowledge of ineptitude and racial bias in governmental responses to Hurricane Katrina had on the actual policies and remedies that have been offered.  The public knows quite a bit about both situations; but this knowledge hasn't actually changed very much.)Consider a hypothetical example. Suppose the XYZ mining company is developing a major gold mine in an underdeveloped part of the Amazon. And suppose that its practices of land acquisition, environmental effects, and labor relations are in fact highly abusive, coercive, and destructive.  (Here's a summary of a report documenting just this sort of behavior in Guyana.) For example, suppose the company has hired a private security company to evict local farmers, and evictions have taken place through the use of a significant amount of coercion; and suppose that the operations of the mine are creating significant and permanent environmental destruction.  Now suppose, finally, that travelers and reporters have unearthed some of the details of these bad behaviors.  How can that information be used to compel the company to improve its practices, or to lead to some form of punishment for the company that might deter similar practices in the future?It would appear that there are only a few avenues of influence that exist.  First, reporting the behavior to the national government that has jurisdiction might result in enforcement of national regulations about labor and environmental practices.  Second, widespread global exposure of the practices might prove to be sufficiently embarrassing for the XYZ company that it has an incentive to reform its practices.  And third, widespread exposure of the practices to potential customers of the XYZ company might lead these customers to purchase their gold from a competitor.It is apparent that all of these remedies are very weak.  National governments often lack either the will or the capacity to enforce regulations -- even when they exist.  Multinational corporations have thick skins, and public embarrassment may be a relatively small price to pay for profitable practices.  And they have deep pockets when it comes to communicating their side to the story.  And influencing consumers using this kind of information is possible but limited.  The effort to discourage consumers from buying \"conflict diamonds\" falls in this category, and in the case of diamonds it may be moderately effective. But it is not likely to affect the purchasing behavior of anonymous companies buying raw materials whose business interests are defined by price, reliability, and quality.So it seems that two things are true: first, that the internet has created a channel for the gathering and sharing of information that greatly increases the likelihood that bad behavior by powerful actors will be noted in some detail; and second, that this degree of publicity is only weakly to moderately effective in discouraging or punishing bad behavior by powerful actors.  So publicity is a resource for the powerless; but it is a resource with fairly limited effects."}, {"title": "Institutions, functions, purposes", "date": "Thursday, June 5, 2008", "text": "An institution is a specific ensemble of interlocked organizations and rules that serve to coordinate and constrain the behavior of a number of individuals; and the specific features of the organization have often been refined to bring about specific effects: enforcement of laws, maximization of tax collections, minimization of corrupt behavior, efficient delivery of services, ... The reformers, in this case, are not usually master designers or architects standing at the top of the institution; instead, they are an army of players and stakeholders who have the capacity to proliferate or modify various aspects of the institution.  So an institution is generally a collective product, created, sustained, and modified by an army of participants, from CEOs to supervisors and directors to front-line workers.The ideas of \"purpose\" or \"function\" are hard to disassociate from the idea of an institution.  Purposes have to do with the intentions of the creators or reformers of a thing; and functions have to do with the relationship between the thing's effects and the broader needs of the system within which it sits.  We are often led to ask questions like these: What is the mission or purpose of the institution? What social functions does it fulfill?  What are the intentions of the actors that are expressed in the various sub-components of the institution?Here, however, we have to be very cautious.  Social institutions and organizations do not have \"essences\" or \"natures\", and they do not have inherent functions.  This functionalist interpretation may once have been appealing but is no longer credible.   There is no basis for imagining that social institutions are optimized for bringing about important social effects. And there is no mechanism of \"social selection\" that serves as a general equivalent to \"natural selection\" and that would lead to a process of improvement of fitness for social institutions.   (This isn't to say that any variant is equally good; smart social engineers will plainly avoid institutional arrangements that are p\u00e5atently unworkable.  But there is usually a range of alternative arrangements that would be \"good enough\", so that the existing arrangement is only one out of several that could have been implemented.)   So the concept of an institution's function isn't a particularly useful one.  (See an earlier post on questionable analogies between social science and evolutionary biology.)It is fair enough to say that purposes come into the design of an institution.  After all, institutions are semi-deliberate social artifacts, and their creators have purposes.  But generally these are the local and parochial purposes of participants at a variety of levels, not the purposes of some grand designer for the institution as a whole.  The conventions of double-entry accounting express the purpose of an enterprise owner to assure the honest performance of money-handlers in the organization; featherbedding work rules on nineteenth-century railroads expressed the purpose of resistant workers within the railroad business organization.  Each of these features reflects the interests of one or another group of participants within the organization.Universities provide a good illustration of an organization embodying multiple purposes.  We might say that the purposes of a university are to educate young people and to conduct useful research.  But immediately we need to ask: whose purposes are these?  The university president? The board of trustees? The alumni?  The employees? The tax payers and private donors?  Society at large?  The answer appears to be, all and none of the above.  Instead of a single overarching purpose to the university, it seems more accurate to say that multiple stakeholders have multiple goals and expectations of the university, and use their various powers to shape its characteristics in ways favorable to the various stakeholders' interests.Moreover, even if we grant that universities have the function of disseminating and extending knowledge, the subsidiary organizations of the university have only a loose relationship to this macro-function.  The processes of tenure and promotion, purchasing, selection of department chairs, governance rules, or student disciplinary procedures -- that is, the academic and business functions of the university -- are themselves the expression of past struggles between agents advocating for their interests.  So we shouldn't expect that these subordinate arrangements somehow fit together in a way that is optimal for delivering the primary function of the university.   Rather, we might say that a university is a complex of procedures and activities that bear some relationship to education, but that reflect differing and sometimes antagonistic histories of composition.This discussion underlines several important ideas about social entities: plasticity (institutions are adjusted and shaped by stakeholders), contingency and path-dependence (the particular features of the institution today are the result of choices made in a prior generation), heterogeneity (institutions should be expected to proliferate and differentiate over time; different universities are likely to have significantly different internal procedures); and agent-centered explanations (institutions take shape through the deliberate actions of the agents who populate them)."}, {"title": "More on what can be explained", "date": "Sunday, June 1, 2008", "text": "A previous posting argued that most social facts don't admit of social explanation because they are too fundamentally conjunctural or too boringly ordinary. Let's extend this thought by considering what sorts of social facts do admit of explanation.One obvious category is the example of a perplexing mid-range social regularity.  Why do used cars usually sell for less than their \"real\" value? Because of the asymmetry of information between buyer and seller (the market for lemons).  Why does ethnic conflict turn violent more commonly in circumstances where the institutions of civil society are weak? Because weak civil institutions undermine trust between distinct intermixed groups. (Here is a posting summarizing some recent thinking on this connection between civil society and ethnic violence.)  Why do collectivized farms usually witness lower labor productivity than privately owned farms? Because of some common features of labor management and supervision that are usually a part of collective farm practices but not of private farm practices, that are likely to result in individual effort that is of lower quality or intensity than the private alternative. (This is sometimes referred to as the \"easy-rider\" problem.)This category encompasses cases of non-trivial regularity. These are all examples of what I call \"phenomenal\" social regularities. They are not manifestations of some underlying set of social laws, but rather the common results of a set of mechanisms or processes in a range of cases  (article). In each case the explanation proceeds by identfying a common but non-obvious mechanism or structural feature that produces the observed outcome.Another important category of social phenomena demanding explanation is the large, complex social occurrence. (William Sewell calls these \"events\" -- historical occurrences that are \"irreversible, contingent, uneven, discontinuous and transformational\" (link). ) Here I have in mind things such as the great Pullman strike of 1894, the defeat of France in the Franco-Prussian War in 1870, the civil war in Lebanon in the 1980s, the Rwandan genocide, or the selection of alternating over direct current electricity transmission systems. In each case we want to know why the event occurred -- the event is important and obscure -- and it is credible that there may be a small number of social mechanisms and circumstances that can be discovered and that brought about the event.So explanation of these singular but extended events takes the form of a causal narrative that turns on a small number of important causal factors or mechanisms. The burden of explanation is to discover the mid-level social processes and mechanisms that caused the outcome to occur. And a feature of generalization comes into this account as well, but at a different point in the story: to say that P caused O in the circumstances is also to imply that P would have similar effects in similar circumstances in other settings.So the idea of a social regularity comes into this discussion twice. First, we are often led to ask for an explanation when we observe a curious regularity -- instances of similar behaviors or outcomes in separate cases. \"Why does this weak regularity obtain across independent cases?\"  And second, the type of explanation highlighted here is a causal explanation, which implies assertions about counterfactual regularities. \"The outcome occurs because of the regular causal powers of such-and-so a causal mechanism.\"  A factor that possesses the causal power to help bring about a certain kind of effect plainly plays a role in statements like this: \"whenever P occurs in circumstances substantially similar to C, O is likely to occur.\" And this is a statement of an idealized regularity.  This in turn lends some support for the idea that explanation and the discovery of a level of social generalization are linked -- but not in the way that the nomological-deductive model of explanation would imply.(See Varieties of Social Explanation for other perspectives on these questions.)"}, {"title": "Mentalit\u00e9?", "date": "Sunday, May 25, 2008", "text": "Is there such a thing as a \"mentalit\u00e9\" of a people, group, or nation? Take these young people at an Iowa potluck supper, or the traders pictured below at the Chicago Board of Trade -- is there a midwestern mentalit\u00e9 that they can be said to share? What factors might be comprised by such a concept? What forms of variation must we expect within a group sharing a mentalit\u00e9? And what are the social mechanisms through which these hypothesized forms of shared experience and thought are conveyed?First, what does the concept mean? Most basically, a mentalit\u00e9 is thought to be a shared way of looking at the world and reacting to happenings and actions by others, distinctive from other groups and reasonably similar across a specific group.This characterization folds together a number of things: cognitive frames for understanding the world, values and norms around which one organizes one's actions, and a repertoire of reactions and responses to scenarios in the world. And all of this comes together in the form of a signature form of consciousness and behavior. A mentalit\u00e9 shapes the individual's experience of the world, and it provides a specific foundation for one's choices and actions as events in one's world unfold.  And a mentalit\u00e9 is thought to be shared across a social group, so it is not simply a set of individual and idiosyncratic mental attitudes.Historians of the Annales school (see an earlier posting) gave special attention to the task of reconstructing the mentalit\u00e9 of people and groups of the past. Durkheim's ideas about the social world seem to be in the background in the focus offered by Marc Bloch or Jacques Le Goff on this aspect of history's tapestry -- though the Annales approach seems to be more psychological than Durkheim would have preferred.  Emmanuel Le Roy Ladurie, for example, sought to capture the mentalit\u00e9 of the peasants of Montaillou in his book of that title, offering substantial commentary on their attitudes towards death, sex, and religion.  Lawrence Stone writes of Le Roy Ladurie's \"sheer brilliance in the use of a unique document to reconstruct in fascinating detail a previously totally unknown world, the mental, emotional, sexual, and religious life of late thirteenth-century peasants in a remote Pyrennean village\" (review in the New York Review of Books by Lawrence Stone of Le territoire de l'historien, The Territory of the Historian, and Carnival in Romans).  And the sorts of features of \"worldview\" that are often invoked in describing a mentalit\u00e9 include superstition and magical beliefs.  A fundamental clash of mentalit\u00e9s arises in the conjunction of traditional, magical thinking and modern, scientific thinking in the nineteenth century.  (Relevant snippets from  The Annales School: Critical Assessments can be found here.)Several questions are pressing when we consider this concept. First, is the governing idea of underlying variation of worldviews across cultures and times valid in any non-superficial sense? Trivially, of course, we recognize that tastes and mor\u00e9s vary across places and cultures. This was one of Montesquieu's insights. But is there a more fundamental way in which Scots experience the world differently from Basques or Yoruba? Or are the differences associated with tastes and manners simply an overlay that sits on top of a more fundamental human similarity?  This question pushes us towards the debate between advocates of \"human nature\" against the \"historicists,\" according to whom the most basic features of human cognition and action are contingent and historically shaped.Let's go out on a limb here for the moment and postulate that even fairly deep aspects of cognition and behavior are historically and culturally variable. Deep aspects of \"human nature\" are plastic and subject to historical construction. This leaves it open that there may be elements of common human experience while postulating a deep-running plasticity as well.  And this leaves it open, in turn, that there is a useful place in historical analysis for the idea of a mentalit\u00e9.Second, we need to reflect upon the ways in which adherence to a mentalit\u00e9 should be expected to vary across individuals, places, and cohorts. And, of course, we should expect variation, since every human attribute comes in a range across a population -- and even more so for learned traits.  So if we think that a mentalit\u00e9 comprises a cognitive framework, a value system, and a set of expectations about behavior -- we should also expect that there will be a range of ways in which these items are instantiated in different people within the same group.Third, we need to attempt to trace out some of the mechanisms through which a mentalit\u00e9 is reproduced and maintained across generations and places. We need an account of the microfoundations of mentalit\u00e9, along the lines of an earlier posting on social practices. We've already sketched some of these mechanisms in prior postings. But the fundamental idea is that there is a range of institutions through which children and young people acquire mental skills and content, both formal and informal -- schooling, religious education, family practices, and local traditions, for example. So for there to be a persistent mentalit\u00e9 for a population, there must be a reasonably consistent delivery system across the population that transmits this ensemble of items.  And sociologists and historians need to be able to uncover some of the specifics of these institutions.And, fundamentally, how would we confirm the notion that a population possesses a mentalit\u00e9? How would we support a claim like this: \"medieval villagers of the Vosges possessed a mentalit\u00e9 that distinguished them from their modern counterparts and their contemporaries in other regions\"?  There are several answers we might give: Robert Darnton used some of the tools of ethnography to get at the thoughts of the agents of the great cat massacre in 1740. Or we might imagine a contemporary sociologist using some of the many-country surveys of values (World Values Survey) as a basis for judging that French and Italian people in 1960 possessed significantly different moral frameworks with respect to certain subjects. Or we might rely on our own acquaintance with multicultural friends --- perhaps certain Danish people and certain Nigerians -- and simply remark internally, \"How differently they seem to perceive and react to the world.\"Finally, we might at least consider the idea that the globalization of communication, transportation, and education has substantially reduced the variability of worldviews and cognitive frameworks, so that modern consciousness is much more uniform than medieval consciousness and thought."}, {"title": "Thinking as a structured process", "date": "Thursday, May 22, 2008", "text": "For some reason I was reminded of a classic and challenging article by Karl Lashley, \"The Problem of Serial Order in Behavior\" (1951). As I recall, the article was a pivotal contribution to new and productive thinking in what became \"cognitive psychology.\"  And it was one of the central components on Noam Chomsky's earliest attacks on radical behaviorism as a paradigm for psychology. Chomsky took the article to provide scientific evidence for the view that there is more to mental processes than a simple concatenation of stimulus-response mechanisms.  Most basically, the article laid a basis for attributing substantial degrees of mental structure to ordinary human performances.  (See this link for a nice reflection by George Houghton and Tom Hartley on Lashley's arguments on this subject.)I'm sure there is more to the article than this, but what I remember most clearly is Lashley's study of \"serial\" behaviors such as typing, where there is some antecedent credibility in the idea that each discrete step is a probabilistic result of the previous step. This would assume that the performance is a Markov process -- one in which each step depends only on the prior one.Lashley analyzes typing behavior and asks, what can we learn from analysis of errors? And simply, he argues that there are patterns of errors that demonstrate that the typist has a representation of the full series of actions as he/she proceeds through the performance. An example would be the incidence of transposition errors between characters in different parts of the word. If we find that there are numerous examples like this: \"PRAZOC\" instead of \"PROZAC\" --then this seems to imply that the typist has the whole sequence of finger movements in mind in the early stage of the performance. And this is inconsistent with the idea that the performance is a Markov chain of linked pairs.Noam Chomsky soon linked that concept to the idea of a sentence being the manifestation of a syntactic structure as a real, underlying mental representation. (He presented this idea in a famous review of Skinner's book, Verbal Behavior; here is a snippet from Kenneth MacCorquodale describing Chomsky's argument.)  Here the idea is that a language-user's comprehension and production of a sentence like \"Fairbanks is the desolate capital of Montana\" (a sentence, by the way, that has probably never been previously written or uttered) involves a cognitive representation of a number of abstract structures that are not serial or linear. Rather, the competent user arrives at an abstract representation of the whole sentence including its syntax, semantics, and phonology.  And the point can be expanded: we might imagine that many kinds of complex performance -- dance, fencing, piano or cello performance -- involve higher-level planning, representations of abstract structures or grammars, and execution of the performance based on the abstract plans and representations.The other alternative is that the full complex performance is generated by an initial setting and a set of rules deriving the next move based on the current move.Now let's apply this perspective to thinking. The Markovian perspective would hold that an apparently complexly structured piece of reasoning or creating is actually a serial process in which one step entails its successor.  And the more extreme forms of behaviorism evidently entailed that thinking is \"nothing but\" a series of learned responses to a current set of stimuli -- so the Markov-process interpretation seems to be entailed by the behaviorist premise.There are pieces of human cognitive performance that probably do have something like this structure -- a meandering conversation or a stream-of-consciousness monologue, for example. But in general, we seem to be confronted with numerous instances of reasoning and creating that do not have this property. Instead, many instances seem to reflect an underlying strategic structure, in which elements that are introduced early in the production are crucial for later turns in the argument or creation. Why does Rawls introduce the idea of reflective equilibrium early in the book? Because he envisions a stage in the argument where this construct will be a vital part of the argument. Why does Monet sketch out the dark shadows around the windows of the Cathedral early in his painting work? Because he has a vision of the eventual gestalt of the finished painting. And, critically, we can speculate that these conceptions are cognitive realities in the mind of the philosopher or artist.In each instance we seem to have a clear example of a thinker whose complex reasoning and creation is not solely serial. Instead, each is an example of an abstract representation of the whole guiding the particular steps of execution. And this suggests something very much like the Chomsky vision of syntactic representation of the whole guiding the building of the composition."}, {"title": "How much of social life can be explained?", "date": "Saturday, May 17, 2008", "text": "How much of social life can be explained?It may sound like a strange question -- surely everything can be explained! And it's true that nothing that occurs is \"inexplicable\".  But consider this homely example: if I spill my coffee on the desk, is there a scientific explanation of the particular shape that the splash of liquid takes? The final configuration of liquid on the desk is fully governed by physical laws and existing conditions; but chance and contingency play a critical role in the flow and splash of liquid as it moves into equilibrium. Some facts about the final equilibrium can be explained and predicted -- the flat surface and shallow depth, for example. But the particular configuration of the radiating arms of the spill is highly contingent. So we might say that the depth of the pool has a scientific explanation but the shape does not.Now bring the focus back to the social. The social universe contains a great deal of stuff that is random, chaotic, and conjunctural.  Social outcomes are path-dependent: later events often depend critically on circumstances that occurred earlier in time.  And this means that outcomes may be decisively shaped by accidental and ideographic events that occurred in the past.Take collective behavior.  In analogy to the coffee spill, we might be in a position to explain the behavior of each person in a crowd -- and it may still be true that there is no explanation of the behavior of the group as a whole.  (Maybe that is suggested by the beach crowd scene above.)  Sometimes there is a salient explanation of group behavior, and sometimes there is not. And we might want to say that any social outcome that is random or depends primarily on a random concatenation of causes, cannot be explained but merely retraced. We can provide a narrative but not an explanation.In fact, for a wide range of social phenomena, the outcome is simply the resultant of many small influences, and there is no salient reason for this particular outcome. There had to be some result, and the observed result is no more distinguished than any of the other possible outcomes. If the best causal story we can provide depends on unvarnished coincidence, then it seems reasonable to say that there is no explanation of this particular fact.The most interesting social explanations arise when:There is a large social trend or event that surprises us (change or unexpected persistence) and there is a previously unobserved factor that can be demonstrated to have caused the trend.  Crudely, we might say that an outcome or pattern has an explanation just in case we have reason to believe there is a major causal factor that produces the pattern or outcome.There appear to be a couple of pragmatic features to this question about whether something is amenable to scientific explanation.  (This raises the question of the pragmatics of explanation in contrast to the logic of explanation.)  First, it appears that there an implicature, in asking for an explanation of X, that X is unexpected. If so, there is an implication of contrast: contrary to the usual situations where X does not occur, X occurred on this instance. What caused X to occur? What factor in the situation led to the surprising outcome now?  And second, there is the pragmatic preference for large and general factors rather than local and particular factors to serve as explanations.So we might test out this idea: the proportion of social events that permit substantive scientific explanations is very low.  Most social events are routine and expected, and they are the resultant of a large number of unimportant influences.  And if either condition is present, then we might say that the event lacks an explanation.The challenge for Chinese sociology is the challenge of Chinese society.  Chinese social sciences are presently in a period of deep uncertainty.  Marxist ideas about method and theory are no longer governing, and new paradigms have not yet taken full form. This transition is especially important because of the magnitude and novelty of the social changes that China is experiencing today.  Now is an important time for engagement between innovative Chinese and Western sociologists and philosophers in an effort to arrive at models of social research and explanation that work well for contemporary China.Here is a brief inventory of some of the many social processes and challenges that are underway in China today, and that constitute an agenda of research for a distinctive China-centered sociology of the future.Most visible among China\u2019s current social changes is the economic transformation associated with market reforms in the past two decades.  The reform of agriculture in the 1980s had massive effects that continue to reverberate in Chinese rural society.  The reforms in the 1990s of the institutional setting of manufacture and international trade have created large currents and pressures in Chinese society: smashing of the brass rice bowl, stimulus to massive internal migration, creation of new ensembles of powerful players, creating of wealth, immiseration of some workers, \u2026Seen from a narrowly economic point of view, the question is this: How can China sustain 10% rates of economic growth?  What further policy changes and institutional reforms will be necessary in order to both support and accommodate rapid economic growth?Seen from the broader point of view, the question is: What are the social implications of this massive economic transformation? What changes have occurred within factories? How do workers reason about the choices they are faced with when privatization occurs? What is happening to displaced workers?  What implications are emerging for public health, for the care of the elderly, or for access to education?  What are the conditions of social well-being across China?  How much inequality is resulting from these reforms, and how is it distributed across region and sector?  How are these circumstances changing over time?Something like 70% of China\u2019s population is rural, with a sizeable percentage swinging back and forth between rural residence and low-paid urban work.  The transformations that are underway in the countryside are very important.  There is a profound readjustment of property rights underway, with a corresponding struggle between farmers and power-holders over ownership and control of land.  The inequalities that have commonly existed between city and countryside are evidently more extreme than ever since 1949; incomes are rising rapidly in the urban manufacturing and service economy, and farmers\u2019 incomes are stagnant. Western provinces such as Shaanxi continue to witness rural incomes in the range of $300 per year\u2014the World Bank\u2019s standard of extreme poverty.  And farmers\u2019 access to social services is very limited, including access to education; so opportunities for inter-generational improvement are much more limited than those presented to urban people.          Corresponding to some of these points about rural property ownership and inequalities, is a dramatic increase in the volume of rural protest and collective action.  Tens of thousands of instances of collective protest and unrest occur every year in the countryside\u2014and the incidence is rising.  The state is concerned about conditions in the countryside; but its response is muted and confused.  At some points the rhetoric of the state has been pro-farmer in the past few years; but there is also a \u201claw and order\u201d thread that offers the stick rather than social reform.  Complicating the issue is the disconnect between the central government\u2019s policies and the actions of local and provincial governments.  The interests of the local and provincial governments are often tilted towards \u201cdevelopment\u201d and modernization \u2013 with corresponding lack of support for farmers\u2019 rights.  The central state appears to lack the ability to control the use of coercion by local authorities in putting down peasant collective action and protest.A common cause of rural unrest is the fact of local corruption and abuse of the powers of local authorities.  The study of corruption, and the institutions of state and market that might help to control corrupt practices, is an important subject for Chinese social scientists.  Parallel to corruption is the question of the extension of the system of law.  To what extent are players able to appeal to their rights and to gain access to processes of law enforcement?  Are there emerging non-governmental organizations and other independent organizations that support workers\u2019 and farmers\u2019 rights?  How can this institutional framework be extended and made more effective?        Internal migration and the status of ethnic minorities are other important subjects for study by Chinese social scientists.  Once again, these are processes that are changing rapidly; it will be important for Chinese demographers, social policy analysts, and ethnographers to put together effective research programmes that will track and explore these processes.The social behaviors that affect the environment and energy use, including changes in the volume of transportation and motor vehicles, present evident challenges for the future of Chinese society.  Social scientists need to provide insight into the drivers of these behaviors, and social scientists can help to design social policies and institutions that might steer Chinese consumption patterns in directions that are more compatible with China\u2019s longterm environmental sustainability.        Many Chinese intellectuals are posing questions about the role of values in Chinese society.  Are there traditional Chinese values that might help secure a stable and harmonious future for Chinese society? Are there strategies or policies that might help to stabilize a social consensus about the legitimacy of governmental institutions and the distributive justice of China\u2019s economic development? Social scientists can probe these questions at a variety of levels, asking the empirical question of the current distribution and variation of social values and the institutional question of the forces that influence future developments in social values. Finally, the social challenges that will be posed by an aging Chinese population, in the context of a dramatically smaller cohort of younger workers as a result of the one-child policy, will be increasingly important in the coming two decades.  Health care, income support, housing, and mental health services will all be important challenges for Chinese society, and once again, there is very little precedence for the magnitude of these challenges in other parts of the world.Plainly, there is an urgent need for a new surge of effective social-science research in China.  But equally, it is clear that these many areas of change represent a mix of different kinds of social processes and mechanisms, operating according to a variety of temporal frameworks, with different manifestations in different regions and sectors of Chinese society.  So we should not expect that a single sociological framework, a unified sociological theory, or a unique sociological research methodology will suffice. Instead, Chinese sociological research needs to embrace a plurality of methods and theories in order to arrive at results that shed genuine light on China\u2019s social development."}, {"title": "Social science history and historical social science", "date": "Friday, May 16, 2008", "text": "Social science methods and historical explanation seem to come together in several different ways; what can we say about the differences of approach between \u201chistory using the tools of the social sciences\u201d and \u201csocial science research that pays close attention to history\u201d?E. P. Thompson treats the making of the English working class.  His work is multi-faceted.  He gives treatment of workingmen\u2019s organizations and publications; churches and pastors; riots and chants; petitions to parliament; and much else.  The story is historical in several respects: it provides an account of change over time and it engages in detailed and fine-grained description of specific circumstances in the past.  Is Thompson attempting to explain something?  Perhaps it is more accurate to say that his aim is to describe this extended, multi-location, multi-group process of \u201cmaking\u201d, along with some sense of the circumstances and features of agency that brought this \u201cclass\u201d into being.  And he goes out of his way to emphasize the contingency of the story that he tells: this \u201cclass\u201d could have taken a very different shape, depending on altered circumstances and agency along the way.  His is as much like the work of a biographer, detailing the development of personality, the contingencies of personal history, the formation of character, and the actions of the mature person.Charles Tilly treats the development of contentious politics in France over three centuries.  His account too is \u201chistorical\u201d: it describes the development and diversity of contentious politics in France through revolution and periods of quiet.  His account too is attentive to difference; he emphasizes the many ways in which French contentious \u201cunderclass\u201d politics varied across time and across region.  The politics of workers in Paris were quite different from those of the winemakers of the Vend\u00e9e.  But Tilly\u2019s account is deliberately sociological and theoretical.  The goal of his study is to discover causes; to test a few theoretical hypotheses about mobilization; and to use the \u201cdata\u201d of French working class history as a basis for testing and evaluating sociological theory.Each of these examples is a major intellectual contribution; each contributes to our historical understanding; each focuses on a historically situated working class.  But the two oeuvres have substantial differences of orientation and feel.  One is explicitly theoretical in its goals; the other is nuanced and descriptive.  One aims at arriving at explanations; the other is interested in providing a qualitative understanding of the experience of ordinary men and women of the 18th and 19th centuries in rural England.  One is historical social science, while the other is social science history.So it is an important question within the philosophy of history, to articulate the difference between these two configurations of \u201csocial science\u201d and \u201chistory.\u201d  How are the two genres distinguished?  Are they differences of style, each embodying a complex of narrative and explanatory values?  Are they at opposing ends of some sort of spectrum, ranging from descriptive to explanatory or concrete to abstract?  Or are they actually logically different in some way\u2014perhaps along the lines of the distinction between three conceptions of time described by William Sewell?Perhaps most extremely, would we be right to consider excluding Tilly\u2019s work from the domain of the \u201chistorical\u201d and place it instead within the domain of social science, distinguished from other varieties of social science primarily by the fact that the data upon which it depends are facts about the past?  In other words, is it possible to suggest that \u201chistorical social science\u201d is not a variety of historical writing at all?How might we characterize some of the differences between these two bodies of writing about the past?  Do they constitute different paradigms, research frameworks, or forms of historical practice?  Do they embody different complexes of assumptions about what to emphasize, what the standards of rigor are, what is required by way of description, detail, and fact; what is intended by way of explanation and understanding; the role that interpretation of the lived experience of agents plays; and so on?Comparative historical social science is a particular instance of historical social science.  There is a well-developed contemporary literature on the conceptual and methodological issues raised by comparative historical social science.  And the participants in this literature generally seem to come down on the side of the \u201csocial science\u201d conclusions rather than the \u201chistorical explanations\u201d side of the debate.  The goal of comparative social science is to assess causation, and to use knowledge of concrete historical cases as a source of evidence for evaluating causal theories.  Examples include the explanation of social revolution (Theda Skocpol), the explanation of social contention (Charles Tilly), the explanation of economic development (R. Bin Wong, Philip Huang), the explanation of labor union politics (Howard Kimmeldorf).Now let us turn the lens in the other direction and ask, in what ways do the contents of social science knowledge aid in the construction of historical knowledge?  What is the role of theory and causal hypothesis in paradigm examples of historical knowledge?  Virtually all historians would first insist: \u201cHistorical research cannot take the form of application of social science theory to the data.  Rather, the historian\u2019s task is to discover the particular and the grain of the materials in front of him.  History is not the unfolding of theoretical premises and good historical knowledge does not result from deducing consequences from general social science theories.\u201d  That being conceded: are there forms of historical inquiry and knowledge that are importantly and rationally assisted by social science theory?One variant of historical writing where social science theory is apparently pertinent is in the \u201ccausal narrative\u201d.  Historians are well served by appealing to social science theories of causal mechanisms in order to explain the transitions that they identify in their causal narratives.  This is a logical point.  And yet, it is strikingly difficult to find examples of leading historians who make use of social science theory in this way.  Philip Huang is an example of a professional historian who makes substantial use of social science theory and concepts; Simon Schama is an example of a historian who is averse to this use.  More commonly, the authors who provide causal narratives informed by social science theory are themselves sociologists or other social scientists (Skocpol, Tilly, Wolf, Paige).It seems from some of these scattered observations, that there is indeed a significant difference between social science history and historical social science.  The explanatory goals appear to be different, and the methods of reasoning and standards of rigor and adequacy seem to be distinct as well.  So the question of how the disciplinary differences fit together is one that demands continued scrutiny."}, {"title": "Microfoundations of social practices", "date": "Tuesday, May 13, 2008", "text": "By a practice I mean such things as agricultural techniques, craft technologies, and customs of ordinary life -- how to greet a neighbor, how to discipline one's children, how to decorate the home for a holiday.  A practice is a combination of concrete knowledge, a string of practical techniques, and a set of attitudes and judgments. (It would be interesting to look at practices as being \"coded\", along the lines of a gene or a sentence.)How about the other half of the question?  A \"microfoundation\" is a set of local-level pathways and mechanisms through which a social process is caused or mediated.  It is a particular set of individual circumstances that create the patterns of behavior that aggregate to the observed social outcome.  For example, the microfoundation for an observed failure to carry off a successful tiger hunt is the set of circumstances of recruitment through which eligible participants are enabled to \"free-ride\" on the participation of others.So -- do social practices have \"microfoundations\"?First, consider the social reality of a practice like wine-making.  Pre-modern artisanal wine makers possess an ensemble of techniques through which they grow grapes and transform them into wine.  These ensembles are complex and developed; different wine \"traditions\" handle the tasks of cultivation and fermentation differently, and the results are different as well (fine and ordinary burgundies, the sweet gewurztraminers of Alsace versus Germany).  The novice artisan doesn't reinvent the art of winemaking; instead, he/she learns the techniques and traditions of the elders.  But at the same time, the artisan wine maker may also introduce innovations into his/her practice -- a wrinkle in the cultivation techniques, a different timing in the fermentation process, the introduction of a novel ingredient into the mix.So the practice of Alsatian winemaking in the seventeenth century has a complex social reality.  There are elements of knowledge and practice common among many wine growers in the region; there are differentiating changes over space and time; and the whole tradition has a history that extends backward in time and space.  We might imagine that the geo-history of the winemaking traditions of Alsace would track the continuity, change, and transformation of the complex of practices across time and space -- perhaps in the form of a set of dynamic maps illustrating the diffusion of the tradition, and the diffusion of variants and modifications, over space and time.Now we are ready to come back to the question of microfoundations.  There are at least two aspects of this story that require microfoundations, corresponding to persistence and change: the social mechanisms of reproduction of the practice from generation to generation (persistence) and the social mechanisms of transmission of innovation across space and time (change).  (There is an interesting analogy here with the reproduction of a genotype over time, with faithful reproduction and mutations.)  If we committed the intellectual sin of reification and imagined that there is one unique and extended social practice that is \"Alsatian winemaking wherever it occurs,\" we would have missed a crucial part of the story just told; there is no essential social practice of winemaking (or greeting a neighbor or decorating the house for Passover).  Rather, there are bundles of bits of knowledge, assumptions, judgments, and behaviors that are embodied in the thoughts and actions of individuals at a certain time; and there are social mechanisms through which these bundles of knowledge are transmitted across generations and across space and time.Seen from this point of view, the study of the persistence, change, and brachiation of a social practice or traditional technology is a genuinely fascinating window into patterns of human activity over time.  If it were possible to trace the travel of an innovation in the fermentation process from its origin in a given village, along the circuits of the periodic markets, across a jump to a more distant place (by long-distance ship, for example) we would have a \"marker\" of the routes of social interaction and travel that were characteristic of seventeenth-century rural Alsace.  The logic of this investigation would be similar to that pursued by historical linguistics, observing the gradual transformation of the syntax, phonology, or vocabulary of a language over several centuries and an extended region.And the topic of microfoundations is an important theoretical question in this story. It invites us to ask several foundational questions:\"What are the social processes within which the complex social practice is embodied in human behavior and knowledge at a certain time?\"\"What are the social processes through which this body of knowledge is transmitted relatively intact from one generation to the next?\"\"What are the social mechanisms of transmission through which these clusters of human knowledge and their variations are conveyed across space and across social groups (from village to village)?\""}, {"title": "Piecemeal empirical assessment of social theories", "date": "Wednesday, May 7, 2008", "text": "The philosophy of science devotes a large fraction of its wattage to this question: what is the logic of empirical confirmation for scientific beliefs?  (A good short introduction is Samir Okasha, Philosophy of Science: A Very Short Introduction.)  In the natural sciences this question became entangled with the parochial fact about the natural sciences, that scientific theories postulated unobservable entities and processes and that the individual statements or axioms of a theory could not be separately confirmed or tested.  So a logic of confirmation was developed according to which theories are empirically evaluated as wholes; we need to draw out a set of deductive or probabilistic consequences of the theory; observe the truth or falsity of these consequences based on experiment or observation; and then assign a degree of empirical credibility to the theory based on the success of the observational consequences. This could be put as a slogan: \"No piecemeal confirmation of scientific beliefs!\"This is the familiar hypothetico-deductive model of confirmation (H-D), articulated most rigorously by Carl Hempel and criticized and amended by philosophers such as Karl Popper, Nelson Goodman, Norwood Hanson, and Imre Lakatos.  These debates constituted most of the content of the evolution of positivist philosophy of science into post-positivist philosophy of science throughout the 1960s and 1970s.I don't want to dive into this set of debates, because I am interested in knowledge in the social sciences; and I don't think that the theory-holism that this train of thought depends upon actually has much relevance for the social sciences. The H-D model of confirmation is approximately well suited -- but only to a certain range of scientific areas of knowledge (mathematical physics, mostly).  But the social sciences are not theoretical in the relevant sense.  Social science \"theories\" are mid-level formulations about social mechanisms and structures; they are \"theories of the middle range\" (Robert Merton, On Theoretical Sociology). They often depend on formulations of ideal types of social entities or organizations of interest -- and then concrete empirical investigation of specific organizations to determine the degree to which they conform or diverge from the ideal-typical features specified by the theory. And these mid-level theories and hypotheses can usually be empirically investigated fairly directly through chains of observations and inferences.This is not a trivial task, of course, and there are all sorts of challenging methodological and conceptual issues that must be addressed as the researcher undertakes to consider whether the world actually conforms to the statements he/she makes about it. But it is logically very different from the holistic empirical evaluation that is required of the special theory of relativity or the string theory of fundamental physics.  The language of hypothesis-testing is not quite right for most of the social sciences.  Instead, the slogan for social science epistemology ought to be, \"Hurrah, piecemeal empirical evaluation!\"I want to argue, further, that this epistemological feature of social knowledge is a derivative of some basic facts about social ontology: social processes, entities, and structures lack the rigidity and law-governedness that is characteristic of natural processes, entities, and structures.  So general, universal theories of social entities that cover all instances are unlikely.  But second, it is a feature of the accessibility of social things: we interact with social entities in a fairly direct manner, and these interactions permit us to engage in scientific observation of these entities in a way that permits the piecemeal empirical investigation that is highlighted here. And we can construct chains of observations and inferences from primary observations (entries in an archival source) to empirical estimates of a more abstract fact (the level of crop productivity in the Lower Yangzi in 1800).Let's say that we were considering a theory that social unrest was gradually rising in a region of China in the nineteenth century because of a gradual shift in the sex ratios found in rural society.  The connection between sex ratios and social unrest isn't directly visible; but we can observe features of both ends of the equation.  So we can gather population and family data from registries and family histories; we can gather information about social unrest from gazettes and other local sources; and we can formulate subsidiary theories about the social mechanisms that might connect a rising male-female ratio to the incidence of social unrest.  In other words -- we can directly investigate each aspect of the hypothesis (cause, effect, mechanism), and we can put forward an empirical argument in favor of the hypothesis (or critical of the hypothesis).This is an example of what I mean by \"piecemeal empirical investigation\".  And the specific methodologies of the various social and historical sciences are largely devoted to the concrete tasks of formulating and gathering empirical data in the particular domain. Every discipline is concerned to develop methods of empirical inquiry and evaluation; but, I hold, the basic logic of inquiry and evaluation is similar across all disciplines.  The common logic is piecemeal inquiry and evaluation.(I find Tom Kelly's article on \"Evidence\" in the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy to be a better approach to justification in the social sciences than does the hypothetico-deductive model of confirmation, and one that is consistent with this piecemeal approach to justification. Kelly also reviews the essentials of H-D confirmation theory.)Mike Poole has picked up on the question of \"knowing poverty\", an earlier topic in UnderstandingSociety, in a very interesting post on his blog, greetingsearthlings.  He adds a really valuable international perspective on the topic of how we understand poverty if we don't experience it directly -- he's Australian, trained in Southeast Asian Studies at ANU, living in Hong Kong, and very involved in the conditions of Filipino people living and working in Hong Kong. This is a really great example of how the internationalism of the web can really make it possible for people to gain a better understanding of the human issues that most people face -- if they want to!  Wouldn't it be great if a serious international discussion of the rice crisis and interruptions of food security in many countries got going in thoughtful postings like Mike's."}, {"title": "Cities", "date": "Tuesday, May 6, 2008", "text": "Cities are fascinating -- individually and in the aggregate.  Are there distinct types of cities? Are there specific social processes that are associated with the development of cities in different countries or civilizations?  Are there regularities across cities in different settings?Two authors I've particularly admired in their analysis of cities -- at very different historical and spatial scales -- are G. William Skinner and Saskia Sassen.  Skinner's historical treatment of Chinese cities is innovative and original (The City in Late Imperial China and The Chinese City Between Two Worlds; both edited books, the first including two major essays by Skinner).  And Sassen's treatment of the global city in the twenty-first century sets the standard for bold new thinking about the social processes that are transforming the contemporary world (The Global City: New York, London, Tokyo and Global Networks, Linked Cities).Skinner is fascinated with the spatial arrangement of cities across historical China, and the hierarchies of economic, political, and social relationships that exist among them.  And he is interested in the extended historical processes through which great and small cities took their shape. A crucial discovery  -- regions rather than nations are the appropriate unit of analysis.  \"Fairly early in my research on Chinese cities it became clear that in late imperial times they formed not a single integrated urban system but several regional systems, each only tenuously connected with its neighbors\" (CLIC 211).  Transport systems were the primary integrative mechanism that Skinner identifies, and in China, transport was largely defined by navigable river systems.In \"Regional Urbanization in Nineteenth-Century China\" Skinner is interested in explaining regional differences in urbanization rates across macroregions, and he isolates a handful of causal factors: population density of the region, division of labor, application of technology, commercialization/interregional trade, extraregional trade, administration.  He finds that these variables do a pretty good job of explaining the urbanization rates for the eight macroregions he identifies (CLIC 235).  A second interesting finding has to do with rank-size relationships of cities by region for late imperial China.  Referring to a statistical regularity postulated by G. K. Zipf, according to which the rank-size distribution for a country or region is expected to be approximately linear when plotted with double-log scales, Skinner examines the rank-size distribution for the eight macroregions.  And in a panel of graphs for the eight regions (CLIC 238-39) he demonstrates that the distributions conform remarkably well to this prediction, with a few interesting outliers (Canton, Kweiyang, Middle and Upper Yangtze regions).Skinner's other essay in the volume is just as interesting, \"Cities and the Hierarchy of Local Systems.\"  In this paper Skinner focuses on the hierarchies within which Chinese cities fall -- one having to do with imperial administration and the other having to do with economic interaction.  These hierarchies are both determined by the nature of the social interactions (and social functions) that are focused on various cities.  And they are distinct. For the economic hierarchy of cities and towns Skinner's starting point is central place theory; according to this approach, cities and towns are ranked according to the volume of products and services that they provide and the nature of trade that exists between the city and other places in the hinterlands.  The central analytical ideas here are \"the demand threshold of the supplier and the range of a good\" (277).  These concepts work out, with appropriate simplifying assumptions, into a hexagonal array of places, containing nested hexagons of lesser places in a descending sequence.  Skinner analyzes the location (spatial and hierarchy) of cities and towns in the Upper Yangzi region and finds that the analytical assumptions are born out.  The administrative hierarchy of cities is defined by different criteria -- location within the imperial system and a characteristic set of administrative functions.  Skinner lays out this hierarchical system and then classifies cities and towns accordingly; and he finds, once again, a set of highly interesting regularities.  In this case he finds that the distribution of administrative functions across cities and towns reflects intelligent administrative design.  \"These findings effectively dispose of the notion that cities in imperial China were but microcosms of empire, more or less uniform creations of an omnipotent state.  Rather, they give evidence of skilled husbanding and deployment of the limited bureaucratic power that a premodern court could effectively control\" (345).Now let's swing forward a century and look quickly at Saskia Sassen's analysis of global cities New York, London, and Tokyo).   Sassen takes a different cut on the dynamics and structure of modern cities.  She places the great cities of the late twentieth century into networks that are global rather than national or regional.  She looks at networks of exchange that include financial transactions, information flows, and movements of expertise and knowledge-based services.  And global cities are those cities that serve as dense hubs of these kinds of exchanges on a global basis.  (The map at right doesn't come from Sassen, but it appeals to me in the context because it uses the connectedness of cities to rewrite the geography of the globe.  See a ContinentalDrift posting for some discussion.)Sassen singles out seven hypotheses (quoting from the preface to Global Cities):the geographic dispersal of economic activities that marks globalization ... is a key factor feeding the growth and importance of central corporate functionsthese central functions become so complex that increasingly the headquarters of large global firms outsource themthose specialized service firms engaged in the most complex and globalized markets are subject to agglomeration economiesthe more headquarters outsource their most complex, unstandardized functions ... the freer they are to opt for any locationthese specialized service firms need to provide a global service which has meant a global network of affiliatesthe growing numbers of high level professionals and high-profit making specialized firms have the effect of raising the degree of spatial and socioeeconomic inequality evident in these citiesthe dynamics described in hypothesis six lead to the growing informalization of a range of economic activities which find their effective demand in these cities yet have profit rates that do not allow them to competeAnd, in a single sentence, her conclusion is:Economic globalization and telecommunications have contributed to produce a spatiality for the urban which pivots both on cross-border networks and on territorial locations with massive concentrations of resources (xxii).The book attempts to document and explore these points through a huge range of evidence about flows: flows of investment, flows of telephone calls, flows of scientists and specialists.  And global cities are the places where these flows concentrate and originate; they are nodes in the global system of exchange that constitutes the modern knowledge-intensive economy.  Like Skinner, she is very interested in networks and hierarchies; unlike Skinner, she doesn't seem particularly interested in spatial patterns (and their graphical expression, maps).These points just scratch the surface of the insights that these two social scientists have provided as we try to understand cities in relation to larger social networks.  But perhaps it's enough to illustrate the crucial point: there is ample room in social science and history for innovative perspectives on old questions."}, {"title": "Logistics as a historical force", "date": "Sunday, May 4, 2008", "text": "The constraint of what people can do often plays a large role in what they actually do. The study of logistics is the study of constraints.  Logistics has to do with the intersection of resource, activity, space, and time. A plan is an orchestrated sequence of activities over space and time, provisioned by appropriate resources as needed. Historical actors orchestrate their actions in terms of extended plans -- which means that they pay extensive and detailed attention to logistics. And historians need to do so as well.One common species of historical question is, \"Why did the agent do such-and-so?\" Why did Napoleon's invasion of Russia fail so formidably? Why did Charles Martel infeudate his central power? Why did Napoleon III fail to respond with effective military action to the Prussian invasion of France in 1870? Why did Alexander the Great avoid the direct route through the Thar Desert?  Analysis of constraints is often critical to being able to answer these questions.In each case logistics comes into the explanation at a more or less evident level. The historian's first impulse is to ask the question of purpose and plan: what was the agent intending to accomplish? How was the observed course of action an intelligent solution? When there is no apparent rational explanation, the historian may then retreat to \"miscalculation\" or error. But choice always involves an assessment of constraints, and this is where logistics come in. What looks like error may actually be a rational adjustment to constraint.  The point here is that logistical obstacles or difficulties are often a hidden factor on the agent's choice -- and these factors may ultimately dictate a strategy or plan that looks otherwise irrational. And historians sometimes give these constraints too little attention.Logistics is relevant to a wide range of complex social action.  Take, for example, the difficult chess match involving two NBA coaches during a forty-eight minute basketball game. Each coach makes a series of substitutions throughout the game. Some are dictated by \"match-up\" -- getting the right defensive players on the floor given the current offensive set of the opponent. But some of the choices may appear dumb in the eyes of the duffer fan -- \"why did he take Iverson out now exactly when he's on a run?\" And often, I think, the answer is logistics. Each player has a finite amount of energy and spring in his legs. And each has a finite allotment of personal fouls to give. So the coach's task, in part, is to manage substitutions in such a way as to make maximum use of his star players over the full forty-eight minutes. It doesn't help much to have built up a 10 point lead with four minutes to go if the top scorer and rebounder are out of gas. And this is a logistics problem.A more serious example -- what about Alexander the Great in his celebrated and brilliant conquest of the world? Why did Alexander make the sometimes puzzling strategic and tactical decisions he made through his campaigns? The answer, according to Donald Engels, is logistics (Alexander the Great and the Logistics of the Macedonian Army). As Engels puts the point, \"When the climate, human geography, physical geography, available methods of transport, and agricultural calendar of a given region are known, one can often determine what Alexander\u2019s next move will be.\" Engels provides careful calculations of fodder, the number of horses needed to provision and feed the Macedonian army, and the rate of speed attainable by such an army -- and finds that Alexander's choices were generally well suited to the logistical constraints and his larger strategic goals.The study of transportation technology as a historical factor certainly falls within the general topic of \"logistics as a historical cause.\" (See Transportation for more extensive treatment of this topic.)  Transport systems like rail networks provide specific opportunities and constraints on choice, and intelligent strategists make every effort to understand these well.  So, correspondingly, the historian needs to do so as well if he/she is to explain the choices taken. (If you want to invade Burgundy from Frankfurt in 1860, don't plan to move your army by train. And if you plan to invade Russia by rail in 1910, be prepared for the change of gauge at the frontier.)Military historians generally pay careful attention to logistical factors as they attempt to understand military choices and strategies. But analysis of resource-time-space-activity factors probably receive less attention in other parts of historical and social research than they should.Where does the concept of logistics fit into the concepts we use to analyze historical processes and actions? Some historians might say that it is a minor and peripheral analytical tool. But seen properly, I would say that the notion of logistics is actually a key concept that ties together the complex and extended historical actions that we want to be able to explain.  It is thus a central concept within an adequate historical ontology.This point is relevant to historical research at two levels. First, it emphasizes the importance of incorporating a careful analysis of the agent's beliefs about the constraints he/she faces into the analysis of the eventual plans and choices. And second, at a more systemic level, it suggests that study of major logistical systems --transport, water management, urban infrastructure, the food system -- may have substantial value as a source of hypotheses about large historical causes. These systems structure the opportunities and constraints that face rulers and ordinary people alike, and they have the capacity of pushing development in one direction or another in a particular historical conjuncture.  They therefore function as historical causes."}, {"title": "Realism for the social sciences?", "date": "Thursday, May 1, 2008", "text": "Scientific realism is the idea that scientific theories provide descriptions of the world that are approximately true.  This view implies a correspondence theory of truth -- the idea that the world is separate from the concepts that we use to describe it.  And it implies some sort of theory of scientific rationality -- a theory of the grounds that we have for believing or accepting the findings of a given area of science.  (See a brief article on the basics of scientific realism including some useful references here.)  Realism, objectivity, and facts go together.  We can interpret a theory realistically just in case we believe that there is a fact of the matter concerning the assertions contained in the theory. (See earlier postings relevant to this topic, Concepts and the World and Social Construction.)Realism raises all kinds of interesting questions when we consider applying it to the social sciences.  For one thing, it requires a useable distinction between the world and the knower.   This raises the question: is there an objective social world independent from the perceptions and concepts of observers?  And this also is a complicated question, because the persons who make up social processes at the micro-level are themselves \"knowers\" of the social world.  So there is a question about the objectivity of the social world and a corresponding question about social construction of social reality.  If all social phenomena are socially constructed, then how can it be the case that some statements about social phenomena are objective and independent from the conceptual schemes of the observer?Scientific realism got its impetus from the fact that physical theories invoke theoretical concepts  that are not themselves directly observational --  muon, gravity wave, gene (at an early stage of biology).   So the question arose, what is the status of the reference and truth of scientific sentences that include non-observational concepts -- for example, \"muons have a negative electric charge and a spin of -1/2\"? Since we can't directly inspect muons and measure their charge and spin, sentences like this depend for their empirical confirmation on their logical relationships to larger bits of physical theory -- and ultimately upon a measure of the overall degree to which this physical theory issues true experimental and observational predictions.  And the empirical confirmation of the theory as a whole, the story goes, provides a rational basis for assigning a reference and truth value to its constituent sentences.  So the fact that \"muon\" is embedded within a mathematical theory of subatomic reality and the theory is well confirmed by experimental means, gives us reason to believe that muons exist  and possess approximately the characteristics attributed to them by muon theory.But all of this has to do with esoteric physical theory. Is there any relevant application of realism in the social sciences?  Here's one important difference: the social sciences are barely \"theoretical\" at all in the sense associated with the natural sciences.  The concepts that play central roles in social theories -- charisma, bureaucratic state, class, power -- aren't exactly \"theoretical\" in the sense of being non-observational.  And social concepts aren't defined implicitly, in terms of the role that they play in an extended formal theoretical structure.  Rather, we can give a pretty good definition of social concepts in terms of behavior and common-sense attributes of social entities.  In the social sciences we don't find the conceptual holism that Duhem and Quine attributed to the natural sciences (Pierre Duhem, The Aim and Structure of Physical Theory; W. V. O. Quine, Word and Object).  Instead, both meaning and confirmation can proceed piecemeal.  So if realism were primarily a doctrine about the interpretation of theoretical terms, there wouldn't be much need for it in the social sciences.But here are several specific ways in which scientific realism is useful in the social sciences, I think. And they all have to do with the kinds of statements in the social sciences that we think can be interpreted as expressing facts about the world, independent of our theories and concepts.Causal realism.  We can be realist about the meaning of assertions about causation and causal mechanisms.  We can take the position that there is a fact of the matter as to whether X caused Y in the circumstances, and we can assert the objective reality of social causal mechanisms.  On the realist interpretation, social causal mechanisms exist in the social world -- they are not simply constructs of the observer's conceptual scheme.  And the statement that \"Q is the process through which X causes Y\" makes a purportedly objective and observer-independent claim about Q; it is an objective social process, and it conveys causation from X to Y. Q is the causal mechanism underlying the causal relationship between X and Y.Structure realism.  We can be realist about the existence of extended social entities and structures -- for example, \"the working class,\" \"the American Congress,\" \"the movement for racial equality.\"  These social entities and structures have some curious ontological characteristics -- it is difficult to draw boundaries between members of the working class and the artisan class, so the distinctness of the respective classes is at risk; institutions like the Congress change over time; a social movement may be characterized in multiple and sometimes incompatible ways; and social entities don't fall into \"kinds\" that are uniform across settings.  But surely it is compelling to judge that the Civil Rights movement was an objective fact in the 1960s or that the Congress exists and is a partisan environment.   And this is a version of social realism.Social-relations realism.  If we say that \"Pierre is actively involved in a network of retired French military officers\", we refer to a set of social relations encapsulated under the concept of a social network and composed of many pair-wise social relations.  Here too we can take the perspective of social realism.  It seems unproblematic to postulate the objective reality of both the pair-wise social relations and the aggregate network that these constitute.  Each level of social relationship can be investigated empirically (we can discover that Pierre has regular interactions with Jean but not with Claude), and it seems unproblematic to judge that there is a fact of the matter about the existence and properties of the network -- independent of the assumptions and concepts of the observer.Meaning realism.  Now, how about the hardest case: meanings and the objectivity of interpretation.  Can we say that there is ever a fact of the matter about the interpretation of an action or thought?  When Thaksin offends Charat by exposing the bottoms of his feet to him -- can we say that \"Charat's angry reaction is the result of the meaning of this insulting gesture in Thai culture\"?  Even here, it is credible to me that there is a basis for saying that this judgment expresses an objective fact (even if it is a fact about subjective experience); and therefore, we can interpret this sentence along realist lines: \"Thaksin's gesture was objectively offensive to Charat in the setting of Thai culture.\"  It is evident that many of our interpretations of behavior and action are substantially underdetermined by context and evidence; so it may be that much interpretation of meaning does not constitute a \"fact of the matter.\"  But this seems to be a fact about particular judgments rather than a universal feature of the interpretation of meanings.So it seems that it is feasible and useful to take a social realist perspective on many of the assertions and theories of the social sciences; and what this says, is that we can interpret  social science statements as being approximately true of a domain of social phenomena that have objective properties (i.e. properties that are independent from our conceptualization of them)."}, {"title": "Chuck Tilly", "date": "Wednesday, April 30, 2008", "text": "Along with many others, I was saddened today to learn that Chuck Tilly has died after a long fight with cancer.

Several things worked well, including simply reading some talented contemporary historians carefully. But the most truly innovative and stimulating twist was a week spent reading and discussing Robert Darnton's numerous reviews of books on the period of the French Revolution in the New York Review of Books. (Darnton's own book, The Great Cat Massacre: And Other Episodes in French Cultural History, was also a great addition to the seminar -- but that's another posting.)Written over roughly a twenty-year period, Darnton's smart reviews provide a great perspective on how the historiography of the French Revolution has changed. From the structural, class-centered approach of Albert Soboul, through Richard Cobb's insistence on mentalit\u00e9s, or Simon Schama's person-centered telling of the story, it is possible to see a shifting scene of historians' judgments about causes, structures, ideas, movements, and scale. All by itself this is an important insight into historical understanding.  And it illustrates an important fact about historical knowledge: no event is ever known with finality.  (This parallels the point made in my recent posting on China's Cultural Revolution.)But in our discussions we also found that it is possible to look at Darnton's reviews themselves as an extended and implicit historiographical essay. In his commentary on the writings of others Darnton also reveals many of his own historical intuitions.  And of course Darnton's own ethnographic turn in The Great Cat Massacre -- evidently worked out while Darnton was teaching an interdisciplinary seminar with Clifford Geertz -- is itself an important step on the historiography of French social change. And so the project of trying to discover whether there is a coherent and innovative philosophy of history nested within these reviews proved to be a fruitful one -- there is.  And this provides an interesting new avenue of approach to the problem of formulating a philosophy of history, a different wrinkle on the insight that we can learn a lot from observing the practice of great historians.Several points come out of this set of reviews quite vividly: for example, the deep contingency of historical change, the importance of the particular, the importance of experience and mentalit\u00e9s, the dialectic of events and agents, and the difficulty of framing a large historical event.(If you have a subscription to the New York Review of Books, all the reviews are available electronically in the archive.)"}, {"title": "Philosophy and society", "date": "Friday, April 25, 2008", "text": "How does philosophy intersect with the social world?  How does philosophical thinking contribute to better understanding of society? (At the right we see Jurgen Habermas teaching philosophy in 1960.)It is possible that philosophy is not a well-defined discipline.  But philosophers regard themselves as having something of a method, and something of a subject matter.  The method, for analytically trained philosophers, anyway, is based on careful, critical analysis of ideas, concepts, and statements, and an effort to arrive at developed philosophical theories of important subjects: justice, rationality, equality, relativism, social construction, ...  The subject matter is a little harder to specify.  But there is an open-ended set of subjects that have drawn philosophers' attention for the past several hundred years: empirical knowledge, foundations of mathematics, the nature of the mind, moral truth, political justice, and the foundations of religious belief, for example.So let's take this cluster of methods and topics to serve as one possible definition of philosophical thought; the question here is, how can philosophical reasoning be focused on understanding the nature of society?One clear area of intersection is the philosophy of \"knowledge of society\" -- the philosophy of social science. Here the questions are epistemological -- how secure is the knowledge offered by the social sciences; methodological -- what methods of inquiry are well suited to the study of society; explanatory -- what is required for a good social explanation; and ontological -- what assumptions do we need to make about the nature of the social world in order to pursue social science research?  It is fairly clear how philosophers can contribute to the development of theories and perspectives about these questions.Another area where philosophy is relevant to society is normative social philosophy -- the theory of justice, human well-being, or communitarianism/liberalism, for example. Here the philosopher brings some organized thinking about values, ethical theory, and the messy facts of human social arrangements into the discussion.  Here again, it is fairly clear how rigorous philosophical thinking can illuminate these questions; philosophy can help our understanding of these issues to progress.But in addition to these fairly clear examples of philosophy about society, there seems to be another domain of intersection between philosophy and society that isn't as well charted. This is \"empirically and historically informed study of social metaphysics\".  Many of the postings on this blog fall roughly into this category.  Here the philosopher begins with some bits of knowledge about an aspect of the social world -- economic development, the world food system, or social contention; but then asks fairly foundational questions about how we ought to think about the components of these areas of phenomena.A recurring subject in this blog, for example, is reflection on the question, \"Social mechanisms or social regularities?\".  And the contributions here aren't purely conceptual, purely empirical, or purely inductive; instead, they are \"theory informed by concrete examples of real social processes.\"  And this approach to a problem seems different from all of the following -- pure methodology, pure epistemology, ethical theory, empirical investigation, or traditional social scientific theory formation.  Instead, this level of philosophizing seems to deliberately call upon a synthesis of some empirical knowledge, some conceptual reflection, and some ontological reasoning.  (Might we say that it looks something like a combination of Kant in his synthetic metaphysics, with Newton and Kepler in their theoretical and empirical research?)(This approach, by the way, is exactly similar to what I want to advocate for the philosophy of history as well: philosophical reflection upon real examples of historical change and historical reasoning; and analysis of genuinely important and difficult problems that arise in both the course of history and the course of historical writing.  So my view of the philosophy of history too is one that is neither purely a priori nor an exercise in direct historical scholarship.)So the question today is -- what is the rational or intellectual standing of the assertions that are made in this synthetic form of philosophy?"}, {"title": "Are there patterns of economic development?", "date": "Thursday, April 24, 2008", "text": "There is an old-fashioned and discredited theory that holds that there are only a small number of development trajectories. Crudely, Western Europe's experience -- agricultural modernization, handicraft manufacture, population growth, urbanization, and large-scale mass manufacturing -- is the paradigm and \"normal\" case, and different processes in other countries are deviations or abnormalities. This is the approach economic historians once took towards Asian economic development; it is substantially refuted by Bin Wong (China Transformed: Historical Change and the Limits of European Experience) and Ken Pomeranz (The Great Divergence: China, Europe, and the Making of the Modern World Economy.).A somewhat better approach postulates that there are alternative pathways of development, and that English, Italian, Indian, Chinese, and Brazilian historical experiences of development all illustrate different trajectories. Charles Sabel and Jonathan Zeitlin explore this idea (World of Possibilities: Flexibility and Mass Production in Western Industrialization).  This approach emphasizes path dependence and the salience of institutions in economic development. Thus Robert Brenner maintains that it was differences in the particulars of the social-property relations governing farming that explained English transformation and French stagnation (The Brenner Debate: Agrarian Class Structure and Economic Development in Pre-industrial Europe; see also a short descriptive essay, The Brenner Debate).But other historians have pushed contingency and variation even deeper. So Pomeranz argues against a nation-based model of development. He argues that China's processes of development were very different in different regions, north and south, east and west.  So instead of analyzing \"China,\" he picks out one large macro-region, the lower Yangzi region, as the unit possessing enough integration to possess a distinctive pattern of development. Essentially, this is to say that the complex of institutions, crops, population dynamics, and urban patterns are unified but distinct in north China and southeast China, and that each constitutes a system of production with its own dynamics. So this serves to disaggregate China into several important and different regions.So, with all this disaggregation and differentiation of economic development, let's ask the question again: are there patterns of economic development? Or is every region, city, or state sui generis?Here is what seems plausible to me. The best hope we have for generalizations about economic development is not at the level of wholes -- regions or nations. Rather, what we can hope to do is to discover a number of recurring processes and mechanisms -- political, demographic, technology, institutional, and economic -- that can be identified and studied in multiple historical cases. In this category of recurring processes and mechanisms, I would include \"proto-industrialization,\" \"scissors crisis,\" \"high level equilibrium trap,\" \"state fiscal crisis,\" and \"rapid urban growth\" -- along with dozens of other comparable social and economic processes.  These are mid-level social processes and mechanisms that correspond to specific opportunities or situations of persons and groups in a developing society, and they can arguably occur in historically separate cases.  And actors will adjust their behavior in relation to these processes in their particular settings, to pursue their goals. Finally, some of these processes will aggregate in particular historical settings -- often in novel ways -- to give rise to a particular historical trajectory.  (Notice that this is methodologically very similar to the picture that McAdam, Tarrow and Tilly paint about the possibility of generalizations about contentious politics; Dynamics of Contention.)"}, {"title": "Retreat of the Elephants", "date": "Wednesday, April 23, 2008", "text": "Mark Elvin's title, The Retreat of the Elephants: An Environmental History of China, is brilliantly chosen to epitomize his subject: the human causes of longterm environmental change in China over a four-thousand year period of history.  How many of us would have guessed that elephants once ranged across almost all of China, as far to the northeast as what is now Beijing?  And what was the cause of this great retreat?  It was the relentless spread of agriculture and human settlement.In other words, human activity changed the physical environment of China in such a profound way as to refigure the range and habitat of the elephant.   \"Chinese farmers and elephants do not mix.\"  This story provides an expressive metaphor for the larger interpretation of environmental history that Elvin offers: that environmental history is as much a subject of social history as it is a chronology of physical and natural changes.  Human beings transform their environments -- often profoundly and at great cost.This is now a familiar story, when we consider the anthropogenic influences on global warming in the past fifty years.  What Elvin's book demonstrates is that human activity is an integral part of the story in the long sweep of history as well. Nowhere is this fact more evident than in Elvin's treatment of the perennial problem of water management in China.  Seawalls, canals, dikes, drainage, irrigation, desalinization, and reservoirs were all a part of China's centuries-long efforts at water control.  And each of these measures had effects that refigured the next period in the water system -- the course of a river, the degree of silting of a harbor, the diminishment of a lake as a result of encroachment.  (Peter Perdue'sExhausting the Earth: State and Peasant in Hunan tells a similar story about the fortunes of Hunan's Dongting Lake.)  The waterscape of late Imperial China was very much a moving picture as human activity, deliberate policy interventions, technology innovations, and hydrology and climate interacted.  There is a particular drama in seeing a centuries-long history of magistrates attempting to control the hydrology of the great rivers and deltas of the Yangtze and Yellow Rivers, to counteract silting and flooding and the massive problems that these processes entailed.  Here the local officials made their best efforts to absorb the history of past interventions and their effects in order to design new systems that would obviate silting and flooding.  This required planning and scientific-technical reasoning (137); it required large financial resources; and, most importantly, it required the mobilization of vast amounts of human labor to build dikes and polders.  But always, in the end, the water prevailed.Elvin's history is fascinating in a number of ways.  He is an innovative writer of history, bringing new materials and new topics into Chinese historical research.  His interweaving of agriculture, population growth, technology, and environmental change is masterful.  He combines economic history, cultural history, and natural history in ways that bring continual new flashes of insight.  He makes innovative use of literature and poetry to try to get some inklings into the attitudes and values that Chinese people brought to the environment.  And he returns frequently to the dialectic of population growth and resource use -- a rising tempo of change that imposes more and more pressure on the natural environment.(See The High-Level Equilibrium Trap for a discussion of one of Elvin's earlier and highly influential ideas -- the idea that Chinese agriculture had reached a stage of development by the late imperial period in which technique had been refined to the maximum possible within traditional technologies, and population had increased to the point where the agricultural system was only marginally able to feed the population.  This is what he refers to as a \"high-level equilibrium trap.\"  He returns to something rather similar to this idea in Retreat of the Elephants by offering a theory of environmental exhaustion (\"Concluding Remarks\"): a measure of the degree to which population increase and economic growth have placed greater and greater pressure on non-renewable resources.)"}, {"title": "Social change in rural China", "date": "Tuesday, April 22, 2008", "text": "Contemporary China is a vivid demonstration of the fact that sociology is not a \"finished\" science.  The processes of change that are underway in both rural and urban settings are novel and contingent.  Existing sociological theory does not provide a basis for conceptualizing these processes according to a few simple templates  -- modernization, urbanization, structural transformation, demographic transition.  Instead, a sociology for China needs to engage in sustained descriptive inquiry, to untangle the many processes that are occurring simultaneously; and innovative theory formation, in order to find some explanatory order in the many empirical realities that China represents.  The social reality of China is complex -- many separate processes are simultaneously unfolding and interacting; and it is diverse -- very different conditions and processes are occurring in different regions and sectors of Chinese society.Consider one complex example, the wide and heterogeneous range of processes involved in the transformations of rural society: the explosive growth of a periurban sector that is neither city nor village; the rapid expansion of businesses and factories; the creation of an entrepreneurial social segment; the migration of tens of millions of people from rural areas to cities and from poor areas to more affluent areas; the emergence of new social groups in local society; the push-pull relationships between central government and regional and local government; the shifting policy positions of the central government towards rural conditions; the occurrence of social disturbances -- rural and urban -- over issues of property, labor, environment, and corruption; the rise of ethnicity as a political factor; various permutations of clientelism as a mechanism of political control; and the social consequences of family planning policies (e.g. skewed sex ratios).  These are all social processes involving policy makers, local officials, entrepreneurs, farmers, workers, business owners, activists, and other agents; they are processes that have their own dynamics and tempos; they are processes that interact with each other; and they aggregate to outcomes that are difficult or impossible to calculate on the basis of analysis of the processes themselves.In other words: we can't understand the current and future development of rural society in China based on existing theories of social change. Instead, we must analyze the current social realities, recognize their novelties, and perhaps discover some of the common causal processes that recur in other times and places.  And we should expect novelty; we should expect that China's future rural transformations will be significantly different from other great global examples (United States in the 1880s, Russia in the 1930s, France in the 1830s, etc.).I began by saying that China demonstrates that sociology is not a finished science.  But we can say something stronger than that: it demonstrates that the very notion of a comprehensive social science that lays the basis for systematizing and predicting social change is radically ill-conceived.  This hope for a comprehensive theory of social change is chimerical; it doesn't correspond to the nature of the social world.  It doesn't reflect several crucial features of social phenomena: heterogeneity, causal complexity, contingency, path-dependency, and plasticity.  Instead of looking for a few general and comprehensive theories of social change, we should be looking for a much larger set of quasi-empirical theories of concrete social mechanisms.  And the generalizations that we will be able to reach will be modest ones having to do with the discovery of some similar processes that recur in a variety of circumstances and historical settings.There are some excellent current examples of research on contemporary China that conform to this approach.  Kevin O'Brien attempts to discover a mechanism of social protest in his theory of \"rightful resistance\"(Rightful Resistance in Rural China); C. K. Lee identifies a set of mechanisms of mobilization in her treatment of \"rustbelt\" and \"sunbelt\" industries (Against the Law: Labor Protests in China's Rustbelt and Sunbelt); and Anita Chan identifies some common mechanisms of the exploitation of immigrant labor in  China's Workers Under Assault: The Exploitation of Labor in a Globalizing Economy.   Each of these books is a positive example of the kind of sociological research that will shed the most light on China's present and future: empirically rich, theoretically eclectic, and mindful of contingency and multiple pathways as state, society, environment, and other social processes interact."}, {"title": "The Perestroika debate in political science", "date": "Saturday, April 19, 2008", "text": "A debate has been raging in the discipline of political science for at least a decade, over the nature of the scientific status and methods of the discipline.  Fundamentally, the \"dissidents\" argue that a narrow and \"scientistic\"  conception of what good political science research ought to look like has reigned and has repressed other, more pluralistic approaches to political science research.  The formal methods of rational choice theory, game theory, and statistical analysis prevail, and the more narrative approaches associated with comparative research, area studies, and qualitiative research have been marginalized.  And, the critics maintain, the flagship journals of the discipline and the tenure committees of the leading departments converge in maintaining this orthodoxy within the discipline.  (Kristen Renwick Monroe has edited a valuable collection that gives the reader a pretty good understanding of the origins and faultlines of the debate;  Perestroika!: The Raucous Rebellion in Political Science).One of the central issues is this: what should a science of politics involve?  What form of knowledge should political science produce?  What is the role of universal laws or regularities in political science? How important are predictions?Another key issue, related to the first, is the issue of the methodology of research that ought to be favored.  Should quantitative methods be preferred? Should stylized assumptions be offered as the basis for formal rational-choice models of various forms of political behavior?  What role should ethnographic research or case-study research play in the discovery of social-science knowledge?Sanford Schram identifies some of the strands of the Perestroika critique in these terms: \"Some focus on the overly abstract nature of much of the research done today, some on the lack of nuance in decontextualized, large-sample empirical studies, others on the inhumaneness of thinking about social relations in causal terms, and still others on the ways in which contemporary social science all too often fails to produce the kind of knowledge that can meaningfully inform social life\" (Monroe : 103).One of the most useful contributions to the Monroe book mentioned above is an essay by David Laitin.  He takes issue with Bent Flyvbjerg's book, Making Social Science Matter: Why Social Inquiry Fails and How it Can Succeed Again, and his advocacy of \"phronesis\".    Laitin characterizes the method of phronesis as one that is sensitive to context and that pays close attention to the singular and specific features of a particular social process -- for example, the positioning that occurs as a city decides on its economic development strategy.  So the method of phronesis is intentionally not aiming to discover regularities across a set of instances, but rather to uncover some specific features of a particular ongoing process.Laitin argues that this approach is too narrow a foundation for social-science knowledge.  He assimilates the phronesis method to what he calls a \"narrative\" approach; and he argues that good social science needs to use a three-fold methodology.  Investigators should make use of the tools of narrative analysis; but they also need to use statistical methods (quantitative analysis across cases) and formal modeling (models of complex social situations based on assumptions along the lines of rational choice theory).  Laitin refers to this approach as a \"tripartite\" method of comparative research.Where does the philosophy of social science fit into this debate?  I suppose that the philosophy of social science I have advocated has quite a bit in common with the criticisms raised by the Perestroikans.  My views emphasize the contingency of social processes, lack of social regularities, multiple conjunctural causes at work, plasticity of social institutions, the value of ethnographic work, and the need for a plurality of methods of inquiry and explanation in the social sciences.  And these views are at odds with the natural-science assumptions about how social phenomena ought to be investigated that the Perestroika group is criticizing.  And some of the researchers whom I admire most deeply -- James Scott, Charles Tilly, Benedict Anderson, Theda Skocpol, or Susanne Rudolph -- are cited in the original Perestroika manifesto!  At the same time, I am committed to the idea of empirical rigor, causal explanation, and making a connection between social science knowledge and practical social problems  -- a set of views that are post-positivist but still in the tradition of enlightened empiricism, and opposed to the currents of post-modern jargon that are sometimes mixed into the debate.So the task is clear: to formulate a conception of social-science research and knowledge that preserves the values of empirical rigor and theoretial clarity, while embracing a pluralism that will permit the formulation of social-science knowledge adequate to the social world and social problems we find around ourselves.  The Perestroika debate is an important one, and can help us better  in the task of understanding society.Quantitative sociology attempts, among other things, to establish causal connections between large social factors (race, socio-economic status, residential status) and social outcomes of interest (rates of delinquency).  Is this type of inquiry analogous in any way to the use of large disease databases to attempt to identify risk factors?  In other words, is there a useful analogy between sociology and epidemiology?Suppose that the divorce rate for all American men is 30%. Suppose the rate for New York City males with income greater than $200K is 60%. We might want to draw the inference that something about being a high-income male resident of New York causes a higher risk of divorce for these persons. And we might want to justify this inference by noticing that it is similar to a parallel statistical finding relating smoking to lung cancer. So sociology is similar to epidemiology. Certain factors can be demonstrated to cause an elevated risk of a certain kind of outcome.  There are \"risk factors\" for social outcomes such as divorce, delinquency, or drug use.Is this a valid analogy? I think it is not. Epidemiological reasoning depends upon one additional step -- a background set of assumptions about the ontology and etiology of disease. A given disease is a specific physiological condition within a complex system of cells and biochemical processes. We may assume that each of these physiological abnormalities is caused by some specific combination of external and internal factors through specific causal mechanisms. So the causal pathways of normal functioning are discrete and well-defined, and so are the mechanisms that cause disruption of these normal causal pathways. Within the framework of these guiding assumptions, the task of the statistics of epidemiology is to help sort out which factors are causally associated with the disease. The key, though, is that we can be confident that there is a small number of discrete causal mechanisms that link the factor to the disease.The case is quite different in the social world. Social processes are not similar to physiological processes, and social outcomes are not similar to diseases. In each case the failure of parallel derives from the fact that there are not unique and physiologically specific causal systems at work. Cellular reproduction has a specific biochemistry. Cancerous reproduction is a specific deviation from these cellular processes. And specific physical circumstances cause these deviations.Now think about the social world. A  process like \"urbanization\" is not a homogeneous social process. Rather, it is a heterogeneous mix of social developments and events; and these components are different in different times and places. And outcomes that might be considered the social equivalent of disease -- a rising murder rate, for example -- is a also composite of many distinct social happenings and processes. So social systems and outcomes lack the simple, discrete causal uniformity that is a crucial part of epidemiological reasoning.This is not to say that there are not underlying causal mechanisms whose workings bring about a sharp increase in, say, the population's murder rate. Rather, it is to say that there are numerous, heterogeneous and cross-cutting such mechanisms. So the resultant social outcome is simply the contingent residue of the multiple middle-level processes that were in play in the relevant time period.  And the discovery that \"X, Y, Z factors are correlated with a rise in the incidence of O\" isn't causally irrelevant. But the effects of these factors must be understood as working through their influence on the many mid-level causal mechanisms."}, {"title": "Agency and deliberation", "date": "Thursday, April 17, 2008", "text": "People act as a result of a great variety of mental influences: instincts, emotions, impulses, loyalties, norms, as well as reasons, intentions, and plans. A subset of this cacophony is \"rational-intentional action\": actions that are the result of deliberation about ends and means, and choice among the set of available options for action. How does this sub-system of action fit into the larger swirl of psychological causes within the actor's mental system?  The photo to the right is relevant; it is an image of a demonstration at Berkeley in the 1960s, in which the motives of the participants were surely a mix of rational, ethical, emotional, and collective impulses.One picture that philosophers of action have used is the idea of \"higher\" and \"lower\" faculties of motivation and choice. This is an Aristotelian model of practical reason.  The higher system is the rational process of deliberation; the lower system is the range of emotions and impulses; and the point of the picture is that the rational component should govern the workings of the lower faculties.How does this construction work as an empirical theory of human behavior (even if an idealized and simplified one)? It could prove faulty in several different ways: The emotions could turn out to be the more important cause, with rational deliberation a weak and tardy late arrival. Or it could turn out that the system of action is a more integrated process in which \"emotion\" and \"deliberation\" play a more equal and interactive role. Or it could turn out that these two realms really can't be separated at all, and reason and emotion are comingled.  We might find that it is possible to deliberate and reason about emotions, and it is possible for some emotions to push the deliberative process one way rather than another. And, most radically, it could be argued that these categories of introspection and folk psychology don't explain behavior at all; instead, we need a more scientific and non-mentalistic foundation for explanation of behavior.There are a few basic facts about action that constrain any proposed theory:(a) actions are influenced by the goals that people have, so deliberation must be a part of the story. Whatever else we observe, it is certainly true that people are sometimes goal-directed and calculating.(b) We can provide clear and important examples of actions provoked by emotion or passion, so means-end rationality isn't the whole story.(c) People often give reasons for actions that do serve to motivate their actions, but that are not framed as \"means-end\" reasoning. (For example, acting out of fairness.)  So there are instances of action that are reasoned but not utility-maximizing.What these points seem to demonstrate is that the mental system underlying behavior and choice is complex. No simple theory -- Markov mechanisms, operant conditioning,  maximization, or rule-following--captures the full range of behavior.These questions are important for several reasons. First, we need some indication of an answer to the question if we are to have confidence in rational choice theory at any level. Second, our ability to explain a wide range of human behavior depends on our having better ideas about how reasons, emotions, and norms play out to create behaviors such as extreme altruism, hate crimes, suicide attacks, or indifference to the suffering of others.  So social science needs to have a credible theory of human agency and choice.Who has the right kind of expertise to attempt to theorize in this area? Philosophers, to start; this discipline has devoted a lot of rigorous effort towards creating a framework for talking about the mind, intentionality, and action. Second, psychologists have some powerful theoretical tools for conceptualizing and investigating behavior. Here I think of the example of cognitive psychology and its paradigm of trying to devise theories that would represent a psychological process that possesses a given set of cognitive capacities (memory, pattern recognition, speech). And, conceivably, it might be that the discipline and methods of neurophysiology and brain science can shed light on action and mentation as well."}, {"title": "The world food system", "date": "Tuesday, April 15, 2008", "text": "Here is one very concrete way in which we live in a global world: the most basic need that we have -- food -- is satisfied on the basis of a system with global reach and global price and production interconnections.  The planet's 6+ billion people need a daily diet of grains, oils, and protein, and the most important of these foods are produced within the context of a global trading system.  Current estimates of malnutrition indicate that a significant percentage of the world's population live in hunger (Facts about Hunger, PRB).  And, after a decade or so of relative stability in this system, changes in the world market are threatening major disruptions of food supplies.  (See an earlier posting on the recent sharp rise in rice and wheat prices.)Consider grain production and consumption. Here are a few websites with useful information about the world grain trade in the past decade: USDA, providing a lot of data on grain production and consumption; UC-Davis, a simple introduction to the global and US rice markets; UNCTAD, a thumbnail of the basics of the global rice trade over the past two decades; FAO, a compendium of data on food production; and IRRI, a compendium of data about rice production. One thing that becomes clear in reviewing some of this data is that the current crisis in grain prices should not have been a surprise.  The forecast provided in the USDA report is based on 2006-07 data -- and it gives a clear indication of the supply and price crisis that the world is facing today.This system is interesting for UnderstandingSociety because it provides a nice example of a complex and causally interlinked social system that invites careful analysis.  And it is a system that has the potential for stimulating explosive social upheaval -- given the political volatility that food prices and hunger have had historically.We ought to ask a whole series of questions about how the food system works:Technology -- how extensive and widespread are the forms of technology innovation that are changing the food system?  Is there a Green Revolution 2.0 underway?Productivity -- what are the trends in productivity in agriculture?  Output per hectare, output per unit of input, output per labor-dayInternational trading institutions -- corporations, commodity and futures markets, flow of incomes to stakeholders.  What effect have free-trade agreements had on grain production and prices -- WTO, NAFTA?Social institutions of farming.  What are the various institutions through which grain is produced -- peasant farming, family farming, large-scale corporate farmingSocial effects of agrarian change -- how do rural conditions and quality of life change as a result of technology change in agriculture?Macro-stability -- does growth in food supply match growth in population?If we want to know how the global world works as a system, then we need to understand agriculture and agricultural trade better than we currently realize.(Here is another New York Times story on the subject, highlighting the tension between food production and greenhouse gas emission reduction. See my earlier post on sustainable agriculture as well.)"}, {"title": "The reality of society", "date": "Friday, April 11, 2008", "text": "We sometimes speak of \"global society\", we refer to \"French society\"; and we also think of face-to-face organizations and neighborhoods as small societies or social groups.  There is an important conceptual point in the background in these common ways of speaking: what are the features of interaction or relationship that must obtain in order for a group of people to constitute a \"society\" or a \"social group\"?There are a couple of points that are fairly obvious.  These ensembles of individuals are not social groups:all the people in the state whose last name begins with \"J\"all the people in the world who enjoy spicy foodall the people in the worldthe set of people who live within 100 miles of their state or provincial capital cityWe would probably say that these aren't social groups or societies for several reasons:these ensembles bring together very heterogeneous and disassociated individualsthese individuals don't interact significantly and persistently with each otherthe individuals in each case lack a common identitythe individuals in these groups do not share a single set of values or moresthe populations described here do not possess a dense set of social networks that link almost all members of the group togetherthere is not a set of social structures that serve to coordinate and orient the behavior of all or most of the members of these ensemblesThe fundamental point is that it would seem that the members of a society, as opposed to a random assembly of individuals, must have some strands of connection with each other.So we might try this out: a society is a set of individuals  --who share a broad identity with each other, in at least the minimal sense that they regard themselves as members of the same society.who share some set of values and ideas -- perhaps non-uniform but overlapping who are related to each other through economic, political, or social interactions and networks of connectionswho are subject to a common set of social institutions.But these criteria are debatable. Does the first criterion above threaten to rule out Canada and Spain, because there are Quebecois and Basque separatist groups within these countries?  Are the people who choose to live in the isolated compound of the Yearning for Zion ranch a part of United States society, given their extreme efforts to avoid any relationships with the larger society?  Is a Facebook group of \"friends\" a society, given that the members are generally geographically and socially dispersed?Most fundamentally, the criteria for defining an assembly of people as a \"society\" can't be too restrictive because a \"society\" is a looser assembly than some other kinds of social groupings -- religious organizations, social movements, or labor unions, for example.  In each of these latter instances there is a high degree of coherence, solidarity, and shared identity and values across members of the group.  Societies, on the other hand, embody diversity and difference across persons: multiple values, multiple social networks, multiple group identities.  So somehow our definition of society needs to fall intermediate between the random assemblages of persons listed first, and the intentional communities mentioned above.We might say, then, that a society is knit together by only an overlapping but non-comprehensive set of relationships, values, and identities.  Individuals share values and identities with some other individuals; this defines one aspect of the \"social-connectedness\" graph of a society.  And individuals interact with other individuals through economic, political, or cultural transactions; this defines another aspect of a social-connectedness graph.  Everyone in a society is related through a set of network relationships to many other people in society; but there is no set of network relationships that encompasses everyone.  And I suppose that it is possible that, when we have drawn out a massively complex graph of networks and relationships within the population, that there may be some groups that exist in \"islands\" within the larger social map, with relationships with each other but not with outsiders."}, {"title": "Knowing poverty", "date": "Wednesday, April 9, 2008", "text": "Poverty is an important social fact in virtually every society. What is involved in knowing about poverty -- for the citizen, for the poor person, for the social scientist, the historian, and the novelist?To start, there is a set of descriptive and analytical features of poverty. How do we define the concept of being poor: is it a specific income level in a specific country or region; is it a specific level of deprivation in terms of access to a defined set of basic goods; is it a threshold level of resources necessary to actualize one's capabilities?And then we want to know the facts about the disribution of poor people, geographically and demographically. What is the percentage of poor people in urban locations? How much rural poverty is there? How do poverty rates compare across major social groups (race, age, marital status)? And how have these statistics changed over time? We could imagine presenting this body of knowledge as a compact set of dynamic maps and graphs, representing the large body of data in terms of a series of displays over time and space -- for example, CensusScope. (Edward Tufte's work comes to mind here -- visit his website and an early, direction-setting book, The Visual Display of Quantitative Information, 2nd edition.)Parallel to this factual and statistical knowledge about the distribution of poverty over a population is the sociological question, what are the social mechanisms that give rise to these patterns and trends?  What kinds of factors cause some populations to have a persistent and high rate of poverty, while other populations experience much lower rates?Another and distinct aspect of \"knowing poverty\" has to do with getting to the experience of being poor. This is partly a question for ethnography -- how do poor people struggle and cope?How do they experience their daily lives? And how do they express their experiences? But it is also an attempt to gain a clearer grasp of the situation of being poor -- what it means for everyday nutrition, how it affects options when illness or accident arises.  Sociologists with an ear for qualitative investigation and conversation have bee able to capture a lot of this (Sennett and Cobb, The Hidden Injuries of Class; Richard Sennett, The Craftsman.)  So making an effort to gain an understanding of the situation and experience of being poor is an important aspect of knowing poverty.And how are non-poor people able to gain some knowledge of the situation and experience of being poor? This is where the knowledge of literature comes in; through the ability of the poet or fiction writer to vividly and accurately capture something of the lives and thoughts of people in very different circumstances than one's own.  This is an important aspect of a multicultural pedagogy: finding materials that permit students to immerse themselves in the texture of other people's experiences of the world.Now, finally, citizens. Poverty, it seems, is largely invisible to middle class people in the United States.  Their knowledge of the basic facts and insights mentioned above is extremely limited. Here the problem isn't research or pedagogy. It is clear enough how the Detroit Free Press or the Atlanta Constitution could present the basic facts about national or regional poverty on a clear and understandable form. Instead, the problem seems to be a cognitive version of myopia. The social circumstances that confront us up close, and that are likely to influence our basic interests, get our focused attention. But all too often, more distant social problems don't get a second look.  And this seems all too often to be the case for poverty."}, {"title": "What people know", "date": "Monday, April 7, 2008", "text": "It is interesting to consider what kinds of social knowledge people need in their everyday lives.This is clearly a question of scale. At the proximate and local level, people need to know how to interact with local social practices and institutions. We need to know how to behave in the doctor's office, police station, and grocery store. We need to know whether the bus requires exact change. We need some way of understanding the provocative behavior of people we encounter -- panhandlers, teenagers, people asking for directions or a match, strangers in a cafe striking up a conversation. (Think about how challenging each of these situations can be in a foreign city -- and potentially how consequential.) And, of course, there is a wide range of organizational knowledge that we need in the workplace in order to function well within the organization.So there are innumerable scripts we need to have in mind in order to navigate everyday life. Some of this knowledge has to do with the protocols of mundane institutions, and some of it involves an ability to interpret the intentions of other people as they seek to interact with us.Now push back a level and consider another zone of important social knowledge -- knowledge of larger institutional practices that we need to take into account as we plan for the more distant future. What choices can I make today that will benefit me tomorrow, or shelter me from risks the day after?  For example -- How does my retirement account work? What will the interest rate be on this variable rate mortgage in three years? How can my friends in the clubhouse or the statehouse help build my new consulting business?  How secure is my job with this employer -- should I be looking for work in a more predictable industry? (This might be a question a mechanical engineer asks herself in the auto industry today.)Now push the zoom-slide another notch and consider the knowledge of the larger social environment that the citizen needs to arrive at political judgments. What is the reality of public schools? How many high school students graduate from high school each year? What is happening in the labor market -- how much unemployment, how many new jobs are being created, what sectors and skills are in demand?  How much hunger,  poverty, and inequality is there in my region or state?  What are the facts about the availability of health insurance within the general population?  How much corruption and abuse of power is there within our government?At roughly this level of abstraction are topics having to do with science and technology. How risky is nuclear power? How urgent a problem is global warming? What percentage of greenhouse gases stem from autos and what share from coal-fired electricity?These last areas of knowledge are the most problematic.  As we move up the scale from the face-to-face environment to knowledge of more distant social and environmental factors, it is almost certain that most people's beliefs become hazier, less accurate, and less comprehensive.  Our stereotyped representations of things like poverty, opportunity, schooling, and employment levels are notoriously incomplete and inaccurate.  And maybe this is entirely predictable from a cognitive \"cost-benefit\" point of view. It may be that the personal cost of being ignorant of the extent of global climate change, poverty, or urban health deficits is low. But from a collective point of view, this widespread ignorance is disastrous. It is hard to see how an electoral consensus can emerge in support of policies that are intelligently designed to solve major problems if the great majority of voters lack an understanding of those problems.And here is a large and important question: to what extent is it realistic to expect that the general public can become knowledgeable, at some level of approximation, about how their society works?  Is it inevitable that most citizens will have a clear knowledge of their neighborhoods but a very limited and often erroneous knowledge of the broader society?  Or is there some hope that universities, news media, and the internet can do a better job of providing a reasonably accurate representation of some of the most pressing social realities and problems, in such a way that the broad population will come to be better informed about the workings of contemporary society?(See \"Folk Sociology\" for more on this theme.)"}, {"title": "China's cultural revolution", "date": "Sunday, April 6, 2008", "text": "What is involved in understanding China's Cultural Revolution?The question comes to mind for several reasons -- but most vividly because of a recent interview in France in the le nouvel Observateur with Song Yongyi.  Song's personal itinerary is historic -- he was a \"rebel Red Guard\" in 1967, a political prisoner in China from 1970 to 1976, a librarian at Dickinson College in 1998, and a prisoner in China again in 1999 for six months for the \"crime\" of collecting documents about the Cultural Revolution. (See his website at California State University at Los Angeles.)  Song is in the middle of creating a large database on the events of the Cultural Revolution, including especially an effort to document the killings and massacres that occurred during this period.  Song estimates, for example, that more than 50,000 people were killed during the purge of the Mongolian Communist Party alone, and he attributes to an internal party document a figure of 1.72 million deaths during the period of the Cultural Revolution.The question is interesting for UnderstandingSociety because it has to do with historical knowledge and understanding.  A vast amount has been written about the Cultural Revolution -- by western scholars and by Chinese people who participated in the CR or were victims of its violence.  We have both first-hand stories and careful academic scholarship that document many aspects of this period of China's recent history.  So in one sense, we are in a position to know a lot about this period of China's history.  And China scholars have asked the \"why\" question as well -- why did it take place?  For example, Roderick MacFarquhar's multivolume history of the period, culminating in Mao's Last Revolution, goes into great detail about the politics that surrounded the CR.   Also of great interest is Joseph Esherick, Paul Pickowicz, and Andrew Walder's recent edited volume, China's Cultural Revolution As History.We might want to say, then, that the history of the Cultural Revolution has been written.But as Song Yongyi demonstrates, this would be incorrect, in two ways.  First, the scope of the violence and the ways in which it was perpetrated -- the military and political institutions that were involved deeply in the transmission of the violence across China -- these factual aspects of the period of 1966-76 are still only partially known.   And there is reason to believe that the remaining areas of ignorance are likely to substantially change our interpretation of the events.  In brief, it seems likely that the scope of violence and killings is substantially greater than what historians currently believe, and the degree of deliberate political control of the instruments of disorder is greater as well.  So the simple factual question, what happened?, is still to be answered in many important areas.  More would be known if the authorities were to make the official archives available to scholars; but this has been a highly sensitive and secretive subject since 1989.Even more important than the factual story, though, is the explanatory story.  We don't yet have a good understanding of why this period of upheaval took place; what the social and political causes were, what the institutions were that facilitated or hindered the spread of disorder, and how these events aided or impeded the political agendas of powerful figures and factions in China.  (When you visit the summer palace and Buddhist temples in Chengdu, for example, the guides tell you that these structures survived the destruction of the Red Guards because Deng Xiaopeng maintained control of the military in this region and gave orders to protect these historical structures.)So the history of the Cultural Revolution still remains to be written.  And this fact presents us with a very real question of historical epistemology: how much can we ultimately know about a vast and important event, for which there are voluminous archival sources and surviving witnesses?  Can we hope to come to a \"final\" and approximately true interpretation of these events? And can we learn something important about social movements and political institutions from this history?"}, {"title": "Agency, action, and norms", "date": "Saturday, April 5, 2008", "text": "How do norms influence behavior?  More fundamentally, what is a norm?The question arises for two separate reasons.  First, we are interested in knowing why people behave as they do (agency).  And second, we are interested in knowing how large social factors (moral and cognitive frameworks, for example) exert influence over individuals (social causation).The agency question is the more fundamental. Philosophers typically want to answer the question in terms of a model of practical rationality and deliberation.  One philosophical answer derives from Aristotle and represents action as the result of rational deliberation.  Individuals have a set of goals and values; they have a set of beliefs about the world; and they deliberate about the choices they confront with the aim of achieving their goals consistent with their values, given their beliefs about the world.  But philosophers and thinkers as diverse as Nietzsche, Skinner, or Adorno would take issue with this reason-centered theory of action.   Other sources of behavior might include unconscious habits or prejudices, instincts, impulses, emotions, and role-playing.  A model that incorporates these diverse possible influences on action is unavoidably complex -- but human behavior is likewise complex.Now let's try to locate the role of norms within a theory of agency.  Norms have to do with the reasons and motives that people have for their actions.  A norm is a particular kind of influence on action: it is a rule of behavior that leads someone to do something that is otherwise contrary to immediate impulse or interest. Norms get us to do things we don't want to do.We might say, then, that a norm is a rule of behavior -- for example, \"Don't wear shorts to a business meeting,\" \"Don't take coins from the blind man's cup,\" \"Give up your seat on the bus to a disabled person.\"  And a rule can either be internally or externally represented; this means that the the rule may be internalized into the agent's process of decision-making, or it may influence the agent's behavior through punishments and rewards.Even this simple discussion raises questions, however.  Do norms have to be consciously accessible to the agent?  Is a moral principle such as \"Always keep your promises\" a norm, or do ethical principles fall in a different category?  Do norms have rational justification, or are they simply an accidental social product like tastes or styles?As for the ways in which norms influence behavior --It would seem that there are only a few mechanisms through which norms could possibly influence individual and collective behavior, largely distinguished by being external and internal.First, it may be that there is an effective mechanism of social education through which each individual develops or activates an internally regulative system of norms or rules.  This process can be described as \"moral education.\"  The most superficial observation of social behavior indicates that this is so, and social psychologists and sociologists have some ideas about how these systems work.  But the bottom line appears fairly clear: individuals who are reared in normal human settings eventually possess action-behavior systems that embody a set of personal norms that influence their conduct.  We might draw the analogy to the example of language learning: a normal human child is exposed to the linguistic behavior of others, and arrives at a psychologically realized grammar that guides his/her own language production.Second, a norm might be embodied in the attitudes, judgment, and behavior of others in such a way that their actions and reactions create incentives and disincentives for the actor. For example, others may possess a set of norms concerning civility in public discourse, and they may punish or reward others according to whether their words are consistent with these norms. In this case the agent conforms to the requirements of the norm out of a calculation of costs and benefits of performance. (It would appear that there is a possibility of circularity here: the externally imposed norm depends upon the internally embodied norm of enforcement of the content of the rule on the part of others.)Third, it might be the case that there are some norms of inter-personal behavior that are hard-wired.  Some norms might have a biological, evolutionary basis.  This is the line of thought that sociobiologists have explored with varying levels of success.  The emotional responses that adults have to infants and children probably fall in this category -- though it is a conceptually interesting question to consider whether these emotional responses are \"norms\" or simply features of  the affective system. This is relevant to the work that Allan Gibbard does in Wise Choices, Apt Feelings: A Theory of Normative Judgment.  Gibbard's fundamental insight seems to be that there must be an evolutionary basis for the \"norm-acquisition system\" -- the features of human psychology that permit them to acquire certain kinds of moral motives (altruism, friendship, fairness).So -- what can we say about norms?  Human beings act on the basis of deliberation, norm, impulse, and emotion.  So our theory of practical rationality and action must make a place for the workings of norms.   Second, norms are transmitted to individuals through concrete social processes -- family experiences, schooling, religious institutions, etc.  Our theories of social life must incorporate an account of the processes of normative education through which individuals come to possess a particular normative structure.  These experiences are the counterpart to the exposure to language on the part of the infant.  And third, norms are socially enforced through the actions of others.  So norms are socially embodied -- in the institutions of enforcement, the institutions and practices of moral education, and in the practical cognition of the individuals who make up the society."}, {"title": "Are there discrete social mechanisms?", "date": "Friday, April 4, 2008", "text": "McAdam, Tarrow and Tilly direct our attention to the level of the concrete social mechanisms that recur in many instances of social contention (Dynamics of Contention). They specifically refer to escalation, radicalization, brokerage, and repression as examples of social mechanisms that produce the same effects in the same circumstances, and that concatenate into historical processes and events. To this list I would add my own examples -- free-rider problems, norm diffusion, and communications networks.I wholeheartedly endorse the idea that social explanations need to proceed on the basis of an analysis of underlying social mechanisms. But can this program be carried out in a Mendeleev sort of way -- try to discover a \"table of elements\" of causal mechanisms that aggregate into \"molecules\" of social contention?The closer I look at the argument, the more concerned I become about the discreteness and elementality of the items MTT offer as examples. Take brokerage -- isn't this really an umbrella term that encompasses a number of different kinds of negotiation and alliance-formation?  So brokerage isn't analogous to \"expansion of ice during freezing\" -- a clear example of a physical causal mechanism that is homogeneous across physical settings.  Brokerage is rather a \"family-resemblance\" term that captures a number of different instances of collective behavior and agency.If we find this line of thought somewhat persuasive, it suggests that we need to locate the causal connectedness among social settings at an even deeper micro-level. It is the situation of \"agents with interests, identities, networks, allies, and repertoires\" that constitutes the causal nexus of social causation on contention -- not a set of frozen mid-level groups of behaviors such as brokerage or radicalization. Instead, these mid-level concepts are descriptive terms that allow us to single out some broadly similar components of social contention.Or in another vocabulary: the level at which we find real causal connections in the social world is the level of the socially situated and socially constituted individual in interaction with other individuals -- the perspective of methodological localism (Levels of the Social). This doesn't undermine causal realism -- but it does undermine the idea that there are meso-level \"causal mechanisms\" such as brokerage that really recur across instances."}, {"title": "Marc Bloch's history", "date": "Wednesday, April 2, 2008", "text": "One of the historians whom I most admire is Marc Bloch. He was one of France's most important medieval historians in the first half of the twentieth century, and he died at the hands of the Gestapo while serving in the Resistance in Paris in 1944. (Carole Fink's biography is an outstanding treatment of his thought and life; Marc Bloch: A Life in History; also important is Marc Bloch, l'historien et la cite.)Here I am primarily interested in the substantive contributions Bloch brought to the writing of history. Bloch was one of the founders of the Annales school of history, along with Lucien Febvre, and he left a deep impression on subsequent historical imagination later in the twentieth century. In particular, he gave a strong impetus to social and sociological history, and he brought a non-Marxist materialism into the writing of history that represented a very important angle of view.  The largest impact of the Annales school -- Febvre, Bloch, Ladurie, Braudel, Le Goff -- is the set of perspectives it forged for the understanding of social and cultural history -- looking at the structures and experiences of ordinary people as one foundation for the formation of history. This required the invention of new historical vocabulary and new sources of data. And Bloch was central in each area.A couple of Bloch's books are most significant.  Feudal Society is a very important contribution to our understanding of the institutions and social relations of feudalism -- the manorial system, vassalage, and kingship.  And his writings about French agricultural history are of special interest (French Rural History: An Essay on Its Basic Characteristics). These books document quite a few important aspects of French rural social life -- both high and low. But even more importantly, Bloch brought several distinctive ideas into historical writing that continue to serve as illuminating models about how to understand the past. One is a version of materialist historical investigation -- Bloch provides great insight into the forces and relations of production in rural medieval France and the material culture of the middle ages. A second is an adept ability to single out and scrutinize some of the forms of political structure and power that defined French feudal society. And a third is a subtle way of characterizing the social whole of medieval society and mentality that owed much to Durkheim. In a curious way, then, Bloch's work picked up some of the themes that constituted modern social theory in Marx, Weber, and Durkheim.Bloch's materialism is most evident in French Rural History. Here Bloch gives a detailed and scholarly treatment of the social and community consequences of the diffusion of the heavy wheeled plough. He provides a careful technical analysis of the advantages and exigencies of the heavy plough, which was most suited to the heavy soil of northern France. And he works out the social prerequisites of this technology -- basically, a degree of community organization that could successfully coordinate land use consistent with ownership and the turning radius of the heavy implement and its team of horses. The technical requirements of the plough required certain social arrangements. And the social structure of the northern French village satisfied these conditions -- in striking contrast to the looser coordination found in southern French villages.  \"Only a society of great compactness, composed of men who thought instinctively in terms of the community, could have created such a regime.  The land itself was the fruit of collective labour\" (French Rural History, 45).This is materialism; but it is not especially Marxist materialism. It doesn't give primacy to class relations. And it doesn't support any kind of teleology in historical development. But the central point was clear. Bloch sought to demonstrate that a major technology -- for example, cultivation with the heavy plough -- incorporates and implicates a whole complex social and cultural system. And a major part of social history is to discover the sequence of adjustments through which the technology system is incorporated.The Durkheim part of the story is also an important one. Durkheim was a major influence on French social thought in the teens and twenties, and the vector to Bloch was particularly direct. The journal Annales d'Histoire Economique et Sociale was created by Bloch and Febvre as a vehicle for inviting a more sociological approach to economic history and to encourage interdisciplinary research in this field, and Bloch and Febvre were deeply influenced by the debate that surrounded history and Durkheimian sociology in the period 1890-1910.\u00a0    R. Colbert Rhodes has written a good essay on Durkheim's influence on Bloch.  Rhodes writes: \"Bloch's essentially sociological approach to historical writing is responsible for some of the most distinctive and useful features of his work. Bloch reflects the Durkheimian social realist metaphysic by reaching behind individuals to the social group considered in its broadest aspect, the collective mentality. Bloch acknowledges in the Historian's Craft his dominant interest in the study of man integrated into the social group. In the Craft, Bloch borrows a citation from Lucien Febvre to state his own interest as 'not man, again, never man.' We are interested in \"human societies, organized groups\" (47).The final feature of Bloch's thought I want to highlight is his vocabulary of structure and power in his treatment of French feudalism. There is a parallel with Weber in this body of thinking.  Bloch spent a year studying in Germany and was presumably aware of Weber's thought, but there is no clear evidence of direct influence.  But there are several ways in which some of Bloch's thought parallels Weber's.  One is in his use of ideas about historical concepts that are similar to Weber's concept of ideal types.  And the other is his careful analysis of the historical realities of relations of power and social structures that embody power.Bloch's writings repay a careful reading -- both for their importance as first-rate historical scholarship and for the light they shed on the problem of historical knowledge and conceptualization.  And it is highly relevant to find that all the strands of classical sociological theory find a counterpart in his thought."}, {"title": "New forms of collective behavior?", "date": "Sunday, March 30, 2008", "text": "Personal electronic communication and the Internet -- have these new technologies changed the game for collective action? Here I am thinking of email and instant messaging, but also cell phones and other personal communications devices, as well as the powerful capacity for dissemination of ideas over the web -- has this dense new network of communication and coordination fundamentally changed the ability of groups to pursue their political or social goals?There is no doubt that these technologies are relevant to collective action.  Communication, coordination, and assurance are crucial features of successful collective action -- and these are precisely the qualities that current technologies offer.  Moreover, the ability for a party or movement to disseminate its programs, ideas, and promises to potential followers is crucial for its ability to gather support; and this is what the Web offers better than any prior form of communications technology.A couple of data points are relevant.The City of New York has  recently subpoenaed the software and records of TXTmob from an MIT graduate student (story). TXTmob is a software tool created more or less on the fly before the party conventions in 2004 to permit demonstrators to use text messages to assemble and disperse quickly and effectively. Will.i.am's music video of Barak Obama's \"Yes We Can\" speeches has been viewed by eight million people since posting on YouTube -- generating funds, votes, and passion for the candidate. Cell phone photos and videos have made their way out of Tibet and Burma documenting the crackdowns that have occurred in those places -- allowing passionate groups of people outside the area to bring their protests to bear.  So what is genuinely new in this list? Covert cameras and travelers have existed for a long time. Cell phones were available in Gdansk and Teheran during street protests there in the 1970s. And newspapers, magazines, and television and radio have disseminated ideas widely. So, again, is there any reason to think that current communications technologies have changed anything fundamental -- either the nature of popular mobilization or the balance of power between the powerful and the numerous?Two factors are important enough to significantly change the nature of struggles between the powerful and the popular. First is the capacity for coordination among a large group that is created by cell phones and IM devices. A \"flash mob\" can form and dissolve in minutes. This can make their actions and demonstrations more effective and more difficult to repress. And there is a secondary benefit for the organization -- rapid multi-sided communication can help to maintain solidarity and commitment within the group.Second, the low cost and broad distribution of web-based communication gives a new advantage to the numerous but poor. Swift Boaters required hundreds of thousands of dollars to disseminate their attack ads against candidate Kerry -- whereas a six-minute video can reach millions of people on YouTube for free. This tips the balance of power away from the deep pockets towards the creative activist group.So it seems reasonable to judge that these communications technologies are indeed  a significant new element in the field of play of collective action.  Groups can self-organize more effectively; they can coordinate their actions; and they can share and reinforce the urgency of their commitments through the use of cell phones, text messages, web pages, and dissemination points such as YouTube.All this has implications for popular politics within a law-governed democracy.  It is less clear that these technologies offer as much leverage for the powerless within an authoritarian state. Combine a powerful authoritarian state's ability to monitor communications with a perfect readiness to repress activists and dissidents and to control the technology -- and you get a situation in which these tools of communication are much less useful for an opposition."}, {"title": "Explaining technology failure", "date": "Wednesday, March 26, 2008", "text": "Technology failure is often spectacular and devastating -- witness Bhopal, Three Mile Island, Chernobyl, the Challenger disaster,  and the DC10 failures of the 1970s. But in addition to being  a particularly important cause of human suffering, technology failures are often very complicated social outcomes that involve a number of different kinds of factors. And this makes them interesting topics for social science study.It is fairly common to attribute spectacular failures to a small number of causes -- for example, faulty design, operator error, or a conjunction of unfortunate but singly non-fatal accidents. What sociologists who have studied technology failures have been able to add is the fact that the root causes of disastrous failures can often be traced back to deficiencies of the social organizations in which they are designed, used, or controlled (Charles Perrow, Normal Accidents: Living with High-Risk Technologies). Technology failures are commonly the result of specific social organizational defects; so technology failure is often or usually a social outcome, not simply a technical or mechanical misadventure.  (Dietrich Dorner's The Logic of Failure: Recognizing and Avoiding Error in Complex Situations is a fascinating treatment of a number of cases of failure; Eliot Cohen's Military Misfortunes: The Anatomy of Failure in War provides an equally interesting treatment of military failures; for example, the American failure to suppress submarine attacks on merchant shipping off the US coast in the early part of World War II.)First, a few examples. The Challenger space shuttle was destroyed as a result of O-rings in the rocket booster units that became brittle because of the low launch temperature -- evidently an example  of faulty design. But various observers have asked the more fundamental question: what features of the science-engineering-launch command process that was in place within NASA and between NASA and its aerospace suppliers led it to break down so profoundly (Diane Vaughan, The Challenger Launch Decision: Risky Technology, Culture, and Deviance at NASA)?  What organizational defects made it possible for this extended group of talented scientists and engineers to come to the decision to launch over the specific warnings that were brought forward by the rocket provider's team about the danger of a cold-temperature launch? Edward Tufte attributes the failure to poor scientific communication (Visual Explanations: Images and Quantities, Evidence and Narrative); Morton Thiokol engineer Roger Boisjoly  attributes it to an excessively hierarchical and deferential relation between the engineers and the launch decision-makers. Either way, features of the NASA decision-making process -- social-organizational features -- played a critical role.Bhopal represents another important case. Catastrophic failure of a Union Carbide pesticide plant in Bhopal, India in 1984 led to a release of a highly toxic gas.  The toxic cloud passed into the densely populated city of Bhopal.  Half a million people were affected, and between 16 and 30 thousand people died as a result.  A chemical plant is a complex physical system. But even more, it is operated and maintained by a complex social organization, involving training, supervision, and operational assessment and oversight.  In his careful case study of Bhopal, Paul Shrivastava maintains  that this disaster was caused by a set of persistent and recurring organizational failures, especially in the areas of training and supervision of operators (Bhopal: Anatomy of Crisis).Close studies of the nuclear disasters at Chernobyl and Three Mile Island have been equally fruitful in terms of shedding light on the characteristics of social, political, and business organization that have played a role in causing these great disasters.  The stories are different in the two cases; but in each case, it turns out that social factors, including both organizational features internal to the nuclear plants and political features in the surrounding environment, played a role in the occurrence and eventual degree of destruction associated with the disasters.These cases illustrate several important points. First, technology failures and disasters almost always involve a crucial social dimension -- in the form of the organizations and systems through which the technology is developed, deployed, and maintained and the larger social environment within which the technology is situated.  Technology systems are social systems.  Second, technology failures therefore constitute an important subject matter for sociological and organizational research. Sociologists can shed light on the ways in which a complex technology might fail.  And third, and most importantly, the design of safe systems -- particularly systems that have the potential for creating great harms -- needs to be an interdisciplinary effort. The perspectives of sociologists and organizational theorists need to be incorporated as deeply as those of industrial and systems engineers into the design of systems that will preserve a high degree of safety.  This is an important realization for the high profile risky industries -- aviation, chemicals, nuclear power. But it is also fundamental for other important social institutions, including especially hospitals and health systems. Safe technologies will only exist when they are embedded in safe, fault-tolerant organizations and institutions. And all of this means, in turn, that there is an urgent need for a sociology of safety."}, {"title": "Processes versus structures", "date": "Friday, March 21, 2008", "text": "Comparative historical sociology seeks to provide an answer to this type of question: what causes certain kinds of large historical outcomes? And it proceeds, often, on the basis of controlled comparison of a small number of cases. Theda Skocpol's classic book, States and Social Revolutions: A Comparative Analysis of France, Russia and China, is a good example of the approach.  So far so good. But what kinds of causes do CHS researchers typically look for?  The method of comparison is often described in terms of Mill's methods of similarity and difference. Find cases with variation in the outcome to be explained and similar/different causal conditions; and then seek out patterns of co-variation that suggest that certain factors are necessary and/or sufficient conditions for the outcome to be explained. These factors are then said to cause the outcome.  (Mill's approach to social research is described in Fred Wilson's entry on Mill in the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy.)This way of formulating the approach has fairly strong ontological presuppositions. Basically, it assumes that social causes are large, pervasive factors that obtain or fail to obtain in the multiple cases. For example, in explaining revolution the investigator might identify food crisis, population density, weak state institutions, and war as potential causal factors, and then compare the cases with respect to the variance of these factors. The comparative method assumes that large social units (societies, regions, social groups) are the operative units, and their causal properties are largescale, pervasive social conditions.But what if our view of social causation is focused at a more disaggregated level -- not at the level of gross social conditions and structures, but at the level of lower-level processes and mechanisms? What if we thought that the action is really taking place at the level of the contingent unfolding of social processes at more local levels?  This ontology wouldn't imply that the large social factors just mentioned are not part of the true causal story. But it would cast serious doubt on the expectation that there will be neat patterns of covariance across cases identified solely at this level. And yet this is exactly what Mill's methods require.The turn to concrete social mechanisms as the unit of social analysis suggests that it is most fruitful to seek out explanations of outcomes as the \"concatenation\" of a set of common social mechanisms (Social Mechanisms: An Analytical Approach to Social Theory). And this implies that the traditional comparative method is not likely to succeed; there won't be a neat pattern of co-variation at the level of macro-characteristics and structures. So what is the alternative?We might say that a credible alternative, still falling within a broad definition of \"comparative historical sociology\", is this: select a number of cases for detailed study. Uncover in some detail the processes and factors that appear to have led to the outcome (process-tracing).  And arrive at generalizations by discovering that certain mechanisms or processes recur across multiple cases, and that large structural factors interact with these processes in recurring ways.This is the approach that McAdam, Tarrow, and Tilly take in Dynamics of Contention.  And it would appear to me that this approach permits an appropriate marriage between social ontology and social science methodology. The methodology is suited to the ontological insight that social phenomena are composed of lower-level social mechanisms and processes, and the outcomes are the contingent and path-dependent result of the concatenation of these mechanisms.  There are no \"laws of revolution\" (or war, or civil strife); rather, there are a large number of social mechanisms that can be observed in many instances of these large social outcomes.  These mechanisms can be rigorously analyzed, and we can explain outcomes (for example, the success of the Bolshevik revolutionary strategy) as the result of a concatenation of various of these mechanisms."}, {"title": "Structures in Marx's thought", "date": "Sunday, March 16, 2008", "text": "The concept of a social structure has often played a large role in social theorizing. The general idea is that society consists of an ensemble of durable, regulative structures within the context of which individuals live and act. Sometimes structures are interpreted functionally: the ensemble of structures constitute a system, and discrete structures satisfy important social functions. This is a physiological approach to society: what are the chief sub-systems in society and what do they do; how do they fit together to assure the continuing functioning of society?There is much to fault in this set of ideas about the constituent parts of society -- for example, its tendency to reify a continually shifting social reality and its tacit assumption that the social order is a system in  functional equilibrium.But here I want to ask a smaller question: does Marx offer a social ontology that includes enduring social structures?It would appear that the answer is a resounding \"yes\".  Marx looks at capitalism as a system. For example, consider this statement from the Preface to the Contribution to the Critique of Political Economy: In the social production of their life, men enter into definite relations that are indispensable and independent of their will, relations of production which correspond to a definite stage of development of their material productive forces. The sum total of these relations of production constitutes the economic structure of society, the real foundation, on which rises a legal and political superstructure and to which correspond definite forms of social consciousness.   The mode of production of material life conditions the social, political and intellectual life process in general. It is not the consciousness of men that determines their being, but, on the contrary, their social being that determines their consciousness.   At a certain stage of their development, the material productive forces of society come in conflict with the existing relations of production, or \u2014 what is but a legal expression for the same thing \u2014 with the property relations within which they have been at work hitherto. From forms of development of the productive forces these relations turn into their fetters.   Then begins an epoch of social revolution. With the change of the economic foundation the entire immense superstructure is more or less rapidly transformed. In considering such transformations a distinction should always be made between the material transformation of the economic conditions of production, which can be determined with the precision of natural science, and the legal, political, religious, aesthetic or philosophic \u2014 in short, ideological forms in which men become conscious of this conflict and fight it out. Just as our opinion of an individual is not based on what he thinks of himself, so can we not judge of such a period of transformation by its own consciousness; on the contrary, this consciousness must be explained rather from the contradictions of material life, from the existing conflict between the social productive forces and the relations of production. Here and elsewhere Marx picks out the forces of production and relations of production as the fundamental determinants of historical change. He identifies social classes as the chief actors in society. And he offers a conception of the capitalist mode of production as consisting of an economic base -- the economic structure -- and an ensemble of superstructural elements -- law, state, ideology, religion, culture --that stand above the economic structure and serve to preserve its conditions of reproduction. All of this invokes an ontology of social structures, social systems, and functional interdependency (G. A. Cohen, Karl Marx's Theory of History: A Defence).The functionalism implicit in this ontology has been deeply challenged (Jon Elster, Making Sense of Marx; Daniel Little, The Scientific Marx). The bottom line of these criticisms seems inescapable: there is no basis whatsoever to expect that social structures will develop that are functionally suited to the needs of the social system. There is no process of natural selection for social arrangements. So if there is alignment across structures, we need to seek out the specific social mechanisms that bring it about.But what about the structuralism? Is this ontology a credible one if it is separated from the functionalist assumption?Here we need to be very careful at every step of the argument. Marx is right that Britain and France possessed a set of property relations in capital and labor in the mid-nineteenth century. These relations were distinct from those of French feudalism in the fourteenth century. These social relations are durable and coercive.  Those differences created different historical dynamics in nineteenth-century Britain and France. So far so good -- there were durable, coercive social relations embodied on the two societies, and it doesn't seem misleading to call these \"structures.\"  Moreover, these structures had historical effects, much as Marx described them to have. Likewise, his definitions of \"proletariat\" and \"capitalist\" are rigorous and historically grounded. So Marx succeeds in identifying social structures in particular societies.But here it is very important to avoid the error of reification: the assumption that the structures of capitalism are substantially the same in every capitalist society, or the same in one capitalist society over time. Rather, there are substantial and causally important differences across the basic economic institutions, and the situations of the great classes, in different capitalist societies. This is one of the central insights of the new institutionalism (Kathleen Thelen, How Institutions Evolve: The Political Economy of Skills in Germany, Britain, the United States, and Japan). These differences over time and across societies in turn imply that the structuralism of the concept of the capitalist mode of production must be abandoned as well. There is no super-category of \"capitalism\" and its logic that can be used to subsume the historical trajectories of multiple societies.Finally, it bears repeating that all theories of structures require microfoundations. Structures do not exist free-standing; instead, they must be embodied on the actions and thoughts of socially constituted individuals. (See Levels of the Social for more on this.) I don't think Marx would object to this stricture -- I think he actually provides an agent-centered political economy himself. But the more holistic advocates of French structuralism (Althusser or Poulantzas, for example) would object strenuously.So this leaves us with a pretty tame version of a Marxian structuralism. Social structures exist. They vary from society and across time. They are not functionally adapted. There are no transcendent structures possessing a unique historical dynamic. And, finally, all these claims about causally active social structures need to be compatible with microfoundations at the level of the social actors."}, {"title": "Social change and natural selection?", "date": "Wednesday, March 12, 2008", "text": "Are there any valid analogies between the evolution of species and various kinds of social change?Here's the basic argument for the evolution of species in Darwinian theory: individual organisms transmit traits to offspring; there is a low but positive rate of mutation of traits; there is no inheritance of acquired characteristics; traits influence the overall reproductive success of the organism (phenotype); organisms with a higher level of reproductive fitness proliferate their traits more frequently; and, in time, the novel trait prevails within the population.  Over long periods of time, the species becomes more adapted to the particular features of its environment through the accumulation of fitness-enhancing traits.  An important conceptual issue that needed resolution in the development of modern evolutionary theory is the unit of selection: is it the individual, the gene, the kinship group, the extended group, or the species as a whole?  For the mechanism of natural selection to work, we need to identify the individual as the unit of selection, not the extended group, because the mechanism depends on changing the frequency of a given gene within the population as a whole.  Group selection is not a valid Darwinian mechanism of evolution. (This topic gained greater clarity through debates over altruism in animal behavior; G. C. Williams, Adaptation and Natural Selection.)In general, I don't find that the analogy of natural selection has proven very useful as a basis for explaining social change.  \"Social evolution\" appears to be a misnomer. In order for the analogy to work as a possible explanation of any kind of social change, we would need to be able to identify several specific things: the unit of selection; the features or traits that constitute the \"phenotype\" of the unit; the substrate in which the coding for traits exists (genotype); the mechanism of transmission by which \"parent\" transmits the trait to \"offspring\"; and the connection that is postulated between current traits and future reproductive success.  We would also need a theory about the mechanism of mutation at the level of the coding of social traits, and -- if we are to stick with Darwinian evolutionary theory -- we would need to assure ourselves that acquired traits are not transmitted.  Finally, the social situation would need to be one in which there are numerous independent \"individual units\" whose independent reproductive success over time leads to a change in the frequency of traits over time.Partly the unsuitability of the analogy for explaining social change derives from the problem of the unit of selection: what are the units over which differential rates of survival are to be measured? The earliest social borrowers from Darwin chose to compare whole societies. The idea was that certain characteristics made one society more viable than another, and over time this advantage would lead to the dominance of the more fit society.  But this isn't really a natural selection argument at all; there aren't enough societies, and the concepts of reproduction and fitness are not well defined.  A second sort of effort tried to draw a more exact analogy by singling out a kind of social organization which existed in multiple \"phenotypes\" in society.  For example, evolutionary economics considers models in which the unit of selection is the business firm; the measure of reproductive success is profitability; and \"reproduction\" is simply survival from one period to the next.  Putting the analogy simply: some firms have traits that make them more efficient and effective; these firms will be more profitable as a result; they will grow larger and stronger; and they will drive weaker competitors out of business.  The market represents the selection mechanism.  Over time, then, the superior business organization will become the standard -- until a next round of innovation occurs.  But this analogy isn't really a good one either, for a host of reasons.  A firm is constituted by the ideas and behaviors of the individuals who make it up; there is no underlying genotype; participants actively redesign the traits of the organization (why else would there be consulting firms?); there is no real analogy to the transmission of traits through reproduction; and there would certainly be the possibility of transmission of acquired traits.  So \"evolution\" towards more efficient or profitable forms of business organization seems to be simply a metaphor, not a theory of social change grounded in a mechanism of social reproduction and selection.  If anything, the theory that seems to best describe the process identified here is \"design, build, redesign\" -- create a form of organization, observe its functioning, and modify the organization so as to achieve higher efficiency.  In other words -- not natural selection but intelligent design.A recent effort to use the theoretical machinery of natural selection as a scientific basis for social explanation is a paper by Paul Ehrlich, director of Stanford University's Center for Conservation Biology.  Ehrlich uses available data about the timing and places of innovation in Polynesian canoe design to make an argument about cultural evolution.  In an interview with Wired he puts his finding this way: \"Features of culture that are tested against the environment will evolve at different rates from those not tested against the environment.\"  Only the abstract is available online, so the full text isn't available; but it would appear that the argument goes something like this. The unit of selection is the local canoe-building tradition; the \"genotype\" is the hypothetical blueprint of the canoe this tradition builds; mutations are local innovations in design; and the winners are those canoe designs that are most seaworthy -- thus permitting their builders to populate more islands and build more canoes. As a theory of technological change, I'm not convinced that the \"selection\" mechanism is doing much work here.  Natural selection is a blind process; the finch doesn't notice that a longer beak would be a big advantage in digging out bugs from the bark.  Rather, the \"long beak\" mutation occurs, and the long-beak finches out-reproduce the short-beak finches.  In the canoe case, on the other hand, it is entirely credible that the skilled canoe builders are themselves observing and applying the test of nature; they are correcting the design so as to address the seaworthiness problems involved in the current iteration.  So, as has turned out to be the case in so many other instances of social evolutionary thinking, the evolutionary metaphor doesn't seem to help much.  This isn't to say that it isn't possible to explain the diffusion of technical innovations over time and place as some kind of feedback process.  It is certainly true that certain design traditions out-perform their rivals, and it is likely that these winners will eventually produce all the canoes within a certain domain (or steam engines, or silicon chips).  Rather, the point is an explanatory one.  We need to look for the concrete social mechanisms through which artifacts and traditions of skill change over time in response to the features of the environment and the society.  And these mechanisms are almost certainly more intentional than the blind process of mutation and selection would suggest."}, {"title": "Technological inevitability?", "date": "Monday, March 10, 2008", "text": "Some historians imagine that new technologies force other kinds of social changes, or even that a given technology creates a more or less inevitable process of development in society.  Marx is sometimes thought to offer such a theory: \"the forces of production create changes in the relations of production.\" This view is referred to as technological determinism.The logic underlying this interpretation of history goes something like this: a new technology creates a set of reasonably accessible new possibilities for achieving new forms of value: new products, more productive farming techniques, or new ways of satisfying common human needs.  Once the technology exists, agents or organizations in society will recognize those new opportunities and will attempt to take advantage of them by investing in the technology and developing it more fully.  Some of these attempts will fail, but others will succeed.  So over time, the inherent potential of the technology will be realized; the technology will be fully exploited and  utilized.  And, often enough, the technology will both require and force a new set of social institutions to permit its full utilization; here again, agents will recognize opportunities for gain in the creation of social innovations, and will work towards implementing these social changes.This view of history doesn't stand up to scrutiny, however.  There are many examples of technologies that failed to come to full development (the water mill in the ancient world and the Betamax in the contemporary world).  There is nothing inevitable about the way in which a technology will develop -- imposed, perhaps, by the underlying scientific realities of the technology; and there are numerous illustrations of a more complex back-and-forth between social conditions and the development of a technology.  So technological determinism is not a credible historical theory.For more credible interpretations of the relationships that exist between technology and historical change, we can consider the work of some very gifted historians.An example of such a study of social-technological development is offered in William Cronon's fascinating history of Chicago, Nature's Metropolis: Chicago and the Great West.  Cronon tracks the effects that the extension of the rail network had on the city of Chicago and the region surrounding it into Illinois, Wisconsin, Iowa, and Michigan.  Cheap, reliable rail transport between Chicago and New York created large markets for grain and beef.  This gave incentives to farmers and traders to organize their activities in such a way as to take advantage of the profits newly available in these markets.   But Cronon points out that transportation by railroad of large volumes of grain required a reorganization of the market institutions that were used: the establishment of grain elevators along the rail lines,  the establishment of a gradiing system for qualities of grain being sold by farmers to elevator operators, and the establishment of a futures market for grain and beef.  And he observes that entrepreneurs recognized the gains that could be achieved by developing these institutions and carried them forward.  So the technology \"needed\" a reorganization of the market for grain; entrepreneurs recognized an opportunity for profits in achieving this reorganization; and the necessary social innovations occurred.This makes the business and ecological transformation of Chicago's region sound inevitable, given the extension of the rail system into Chicago.  However, contingency comes into this story from numerous angles.  The build-out of the American rail network was itself a highly contingent matter; the major east-west lines could have been placed in numerous alternative routes, including a network that would have made St. Louis the major rail nexus in the center of the country.  Second, the policy environment within which the American rail network developed represented another major form of contingency.  As Frank Dobbin demonstrates, England, France, and the United States possessed very different \"policy cultures\", and these differences created substantial differences in the way in which the basic technology of the railroad was exploited in the three national settings (Forging Industrial Policy: The United States, Britain, and France in the Railway Age).  And third, there are multiple social solutions that would work roughly as well as the institutions of the grain elevator and the futures market for solving the business challenges of mass transport and marketing of grain.  The solutions that emerged in Chicago were therefore contingent as well.Cronon and Dobbin illustrate several different aspects of technological causes and technological contingency in their accounts of the railroad.  But for an author who takes the contingency of technology change even more seriously, see Thomas Hughes' history of electric power in Networks of Power: Electrification in Western Society, 1880-1930. Hughes demonstrates that the basic scientific discoveries associated with the technology of electric power had multiple possible realizations in machines and devices, and that the social constraints that existed in different national scientific-technical-political cultures led to substantial and fundamental differences in the development of the technology.  The celebrated contest between alternating and direct current as the foundation of power transmission is one such example, but there are hundreds of other examples of choice that can be uncovered in the history of this fundamental modern technology.  And, most pointedly, Hughes illustrates the way in which different municipal political requirements in England, France, and the United States led to substantially different implementations of the power stations and transmission networks in the three national contexts.These examples illustrate several fundamental points about the role of technology in historical change.  A new technology creates new opportunities for power, wealth, efficiency, or productivity; so a new technology can be a powerful force for social and economic change.  Governments, farmers, entrepreneurs, and corporations have a complicated set of incentives that lead them to consider developing the new technology.  So new technologies certainly function as effective historical causes.  The development of a technology, however, introduces deeply significant elements of contingency. The term \"path-dependency\" is an accurate description of the process of the development of a major technology.  Third, a technology is both influenced by social factors in the society in which it is developed, and also influences the future direction of social factors in the society.   Thus technology is both cause and effect of social change.  And, finally, it is evident that the study of the history of technology is inevitably a study of social processes and institutions as much as it is a study of machines and inventions.  Technology is a social product, shaped by the needs and powers that exist in society as much as it is shaped by scientific imagination and discovery."}, {"title": "Chaos and coordination in social life", "date": "Sunday, March 9, 2008", "text": "Much social behavior is chaotic, in that it simply emerges from the independent choices of numerous agents during a period of time. It is analogous to Brownian motion -- particles in a liquid moving in random motions as a result of innumerable bumps and pushes at the molecular level.However, there are also many patterns that become visible in social behavior -- examples of what I would like to call \"coordinated social action\": stock market panic selling, holiday travel, rumors, style, riots, pickpockets in train stations.   And we can identify many causes of coordination of individual behavior into larger patterns: commands, regulations, institutions, customs, conventions, collective plans, shared beliefs about social behavior, common sources of information, and common changes in the environment of choice, for example.What I mean by \"coordination\" here is the opposite of chaos -- something analogous to the coherence of photons associated with the laser effect.  In a laser a set of photons are stimulated to fire coherently with each other, resulting in a beam of light that possesses focus and parallel propagation that is different in kind from the scattered diffusion of photons from an incandescent bulb.  \"Coordinated\" social action is a set of actions that possess synchronicity or regularity in their occurrence, resulting in an observable regularity of behavior over time and space.  A crucial problem for social inquiry is to provide an explanation of the mechanisms that underlie the instances of coordinated social action that we can identify.Examples of coordinated social action can easily be offered, and specific mechanisms can be identified that produce these forms of social coordination. An army moves in concert across a landscape (command). People drive on the right in North America (regulation). People send their children to school (institution).  People greet each other with a polite \"good morning\" (custom). Villagers come together to fish as a group in the morning (convention). People discuss a spontaneous demonstration in front of the mayor's office on Wednesday, and many appear (collective plans).  Drivers choose Route 3 rather than Route 1 because they expect a lot of traffic on Route 1 (shared beliefs). People buy a large number of batteries and chocolate, anticipating an approaching hurricane (common environmental change).These are all mechanisms that create a degree of coordination or synchronization of behavior among independent agents. There seem to be several large categories of mechanisms here: hierarchical coordination (command, regulation); common response coordination (each individually responds to the same signal); communications and network coordination (individuals exchange messages to secure coordination); and strategic coordination (each intends to behave in a way that will be desirable given his/her expectation of actions by others).  Might we try out the thought that all forms of regularities of social behavior derive from one or another of these forms of coordination? This thought is probably somewhat too strong a claim. For example, there are probably social regularities that derive from our biology and evolutionary histories -- limitations of memory, bonds of intra-group loyalty, kin altruism. But the impulse is a sound one: when we are able to observe patterns of social behavior, there must be a cause of those regularities that works its way through influence on the individual actors who constitute the domain of action. And there are only so many mechanisms that might serve.These sorts of regularities and mechanisms constitute part of the regularity of social life, but perhaps only part.  It may be that they don't capture other kinds of more \"structural\" regularities -- for example, \"racial discrimination increases health disparities,\" \"feudal political systems are slow to respond to external aggression\", \"capitalist market systems are more innovaative than planned economies\".  But there is an important aspect of social explanation that centers exactly on this question: what are the social mechanisms that bring a degree of coherence and coordination among the actions of a population of independent actors?"}, {"title": "Prejudice and social framing", "date": "Saturday, March 8, 2008", "text": "People bring highly contingent assumptions, beliefs, and frames to their reading of their social worlds. These framing assumptions are presumably the effect of prior life experiences and learning -- this is what we  can refer to as the social psychology of social perception.(It is possible there is some degree of biology here as well; we can't exclude the possibility that there is a natural-selection basis to a neurophysiology of social perception, as argued by the sociobiologists. The case is not resolved at present.  Are there any social impulses that are hard-wired through our evolutionary history?)Another thing we know about social cognition is that human beings are great storytellers. We can take a small detail and weave it into an orderly narrative. And we are likely to tell stories that play out our expectations, fears, or hopes. We interpret the events and behavior around us in ways that go vastly beyond the slender facts that we observe.(There is probably a developed area of research on this particular feature of social cognition, analogous to the study of reading or pattern recognition, though I am unaware of such research. But it would go something like this: assemble a set of video clips of people acting and interacting without much explicit context, and ask the subjects to briefly describe what is going on. Insert various social cues and see how that changes the stories subjects construct -- for example, change the actor's clothing or adornments slightly.)Now let's see what the point is. I suggest that these features of human social cognition make prejudice and discriminiation a very common feature of social cognition. Take a small dimension of mistrust of strangers; add to this a slight propensity for being uncomfortable with difference; add the usual fact of the information sparsity available in most social interactions; and fold in the degree of fictionalizing and narrative construction that social cognition normally involves -- and what are you likely to get? It seems credible that the resulting stories will often enough represent the other in terms that support prejudice, discrimination and fear. And it seems credible that these internalized stories, and the actions and consequences they produce, will reinforce and proliferate the prejudicial stories and behaviors.This suggests a basis for expecting mechanisms of social cognition that are xenophobic, racist, homophobic, and sexist. It is an unpleasant possibility.It also suggests that when we advocate for a society based on assumptions of trust, equality, and mutual respect -- that we need to be considering as well how to create a learning environment that creates these cognitive habits. We shouldn't assume that trust and equality are \"natural\" states of mind, but rather a set of cognitive habits that need to be specifically cultivated.If this has some credibility, it probably gives some indications of what a non-xenophobic pedagogy ought to look like. It ought to work to provide more background knowledge about human differences -- to fill in part of the data gap. It ought to work specifically to defuse theorigins of \"stranger anxiety\" -- to work against the background of fear that structures many human interactions. And it ought to affirmatively make the case for equality among persons -- to counteract a tendency for the group superiority stories to emerge.In other words, a just and equalitarian society needs to be created. It isn't an accident."}, {"title": "How does regional economic development work?", "date": "Thursday, March 6, 2008", "text": "Countries, states, regions, and cities are interested in stimulating economic development in their jurisdictions.  Various possible strategies are often mentioned:encourage entrepreneurshipimprove the talent baseenhance the attractiveness of the region to outsiders with creative talentscreate a legal, fiscal, and regulatory environment that encourages new businessescreate larger pools of venture capitalattract out-of-region businesses through regional business-attraction centersencourage research and development in local universitiesfacilitate the movement of inventions from the lab to the business planThe primary question here is a causal one: what strategies actually work, and how would we use empirical research to evaluate alternative policy interventions by governmental and non-governmental organizations?  How would we decide which policies to invest in?In order to begin to answer this question, we need to get a little more specific about what we mean by \"regional economic development.\" I'll just stipulate an answer to this:Regional economic development entails the creation of new businesses and expansion of existing businesses, in a way that expands the total number of jobs and results in a rising average wage. So regional economic development aims at creating more employment and a rising standard of living in the region, and it seeks to do this through causing expansion of profitable business activity in the region. And, in order to create higher-paid jobs, the businesses created or expanded need to be on the high-value-added end of the spectrum; this often means skill- or knowledge-intensive industries. New jobs in low-productivity manufacturing or service businesses will not increase the average wage.(The last statement isn't necessarily true in a region with persistent unemployment. A new low-productivity factory with a low average wage will raise the average standard of living if it significantly reduces unemployment.  However, it seems perverse to have the goal of stimulating the growth of low-productivity sectors and businesses rather than higher-wage opportunities.)There are several ideas that arise from these simple statements and questions. One concerns the limits that exist on the ability of state or local governments to actually influence the rate of growth of business activity, jobs, and wages at all. It is an open question whether a state or region that has done an optimal job of aligning its policies and investments will actually have a higher probability of growth in these outcomes than one that has no strategies, bad strategies, or poorly aligned strategies. This is because the decisions made by investors and entrepreneurs are influenced by many other factors besides the policy tools available to the municipal or state governments. And the success or failure of business choices is determined by events outside the policy arena.  The best way of capturing this thought is to recognize that the causal influence of good policies may still be small relative to other non-policy factors.Second, though, we might have strong theoretical reasons for thinking that one policy choice is likely to have larger effects on the desired outcome than another.  If we can demonstrate a theoretical basis in economics or organizational theory, for example, for concluding that factors X, Y, and Z are favorable for producing the outcomes we want, even if they are not decisive, then it is logical that we should try to identify the most influential of these factors; design a coherent package of policies that enhance these factors (i.e. avoid combinations that are self-defeating), and make the effort possible to implement this package of policies. That is, there may be a basis in social science theory for judging that policy X should have a positive effect on the probability of desired outcome Y.  The reasoning may be economic (businesses will have an incentive to locate in regions where they can have a high confidence of recruiting a qualified workforce) or perhaps logistical (businesses will choose locations where transport is convenient) or fiscal (firms will take careful account of the total cost of doing business in Michigan versus California or North Carolina).  But if we can demonstrate on theoretical grounds that X should positively influence Y, then we have reason to implement X even if we don\u2019t have direct empirical evidence of X\u2019s effectiveness.This is the role of theory in justifying the choice of a policy package: a set of antecedent theoretical reasons for believing that this set of policies will work to increase the outcomes we are interested in achieving. There is another more empirical basis for assessing alternative policies, based on comparison of cases: look at a number of cases in which X is present or not present, and measure the status of Y. From a social science point of view, this inquiry is feasible but difficult.  If we select six cities for comparison and find that the cities with a high percentage of college grads have high growth while those with low college grad percentages have low growth -- does that demonstrate that \"talent causes economic growth\"? Not exactly; the observed correlation could be spurious, accidental, collateral, or reversed. And likewise with the large-N version of the study. Suppose we find either that Y is positively correlated with X or that Y is not correlated with X, based on the values of X and Y over a large number of cases.  Does the first finding demonstrate that \u201cX causes Y\u201d, and does the second case demonstrate that \u201cX does not cause Y\u201d? Neither conclusion is justified on the basis of just these facts.  The non-correlation finding may be the result of a genuine causal influence masked by a number of disturbing influences; and the positive correlation may be the result of a common cause that is influencing both X and Y.  So, as econometricians and epidemiologists know very well, the design of empirical studies that sort out the causal impact of various treatments is challenging.In addition to these issues having to do with our ability to assess the causal weight of various policy treatments, we also have to consider the ratio of costs and benefits associated with various bundles of policies. Policy makers are forced to arrive at some estimate of the relative costs and benefits of the available policy options in order to make sensible choices among them.  But here too there are the same problems of estimation: it is difficult to estimate either the probability of success of a given policy or the net value of the success of the policy.The upshot of this short reflection, if there is one, is that it is very difficult to arrive at solid, precise, and rigorous estimates of either the economic impact of various policy choices or of their likelihood of success.  And yet the policymaker does not have the luxury of indecision; economic development is a crucially important component of the wellbeing of a region's population.  So it seems unavoidable that the best we can do is to assess policies on the basis of their likely contribution to economic growth, based on available economic and social theories, and be ready to finetune our choices as experience indicates."}, {"title": "Concepts and the world", "date": "Wednesday, March 5, 2008", "text": "What is the relation between concepts and the world?  And how do we arrive at a conceptual scheme that provides a perspicuous way of representing reality?This way of putting the question invokes one of the central polarities that has defined modern philosophy, including the traditions of Locke, Descartes, and Kant.  It is the contrast of representation and reality; the polarity between the structures of mentation through which we conceptualize and represent the world, and the world itself, the given, the objective features of reality independent from our schemes of representation.  Richard Rorty's title, Philosophy and the Mirror of Nature, expresses his skepticism about this polarity and about the conception of the relation between knower and the known that it corresponds to.  But the intellectual conundrums these questions raise are unavoidable.One of the views that we can take on the relation between mind and world is \"realism\": the idea that, for a given range of stuff, the stuff is independent from the ways in which we represent it.  So we can be realist about fish or electrons, for example; and what this means is that we think there are real fish and electrons, and that their properties are objective and independent of the ways in which we conceive or represent them.   But there is a huge problem with this view -- even as much as I want to defend a form of realism.  It is the problem that \"properties\" are not objective features of the world, but are rather attributes singled out by concepts.  And concepts are part of our mental schemes -- not inherent or objective features of the world that we are representing.  So properties are not objective features of reality.  \"Facts\" are similarly representation-dependent: we can't express a fact about the world except on the basis of a set of concepts.  So we can't say that properties and facts are independent of the scheme of representation.  And this seems to lead to the conclusion that naive realism is untenable.The alternatives to realism include idealism and conceptualism -- the view that the properties of \"stuff\" are constituted by the mental schemes that we bring to the study of \"stuff\".  But idealism is intellectually unpalatable, in its Berkeleian version anyway: in the idea that there is no objective, material world, but only a set of subjective mental representations conforming to an orderly succession in the mind.  A particular version of conceptualism is the Whorf hypothesis, according to which different cultures inhabit different worlds because of the fundamental and incommensurable differences that exist between their conceptual schemes (Benjamin Whorf, Language, Thought, and Reality).  And there is the Kantian version of these ideas -- the view that empirical reality cannot be recognized except through an organizing set of concepts or categories; so naive realism is ultimately incoherent.  There is nothing we can say about a \"noumenal\" world -- a world as it really is beyond the categories of empirical experience.So we might cautiously admit to the correctness of \"conceptualism\" -- that anything we say about the objective or real features of the world in inevitably couched within a set of concepts or categories, and there is no uniquely best set of concepts on the basis of which to analyze experience.  This doesn't take us to idealism, however.  It doesn't say that the world is subjective or constituted by consciousness; it doesn't say that the world lacks an independent status from the mind.  What it says is that knowledge and representation of the world are inherently conceptual -- and this is an act of mentation rather than simply a reflection of the objective features of the world.Within this conceptualism, we might say that the best we can do is to acknowledge that the world of stuff interacts with the knower; the knower brings a set of concepts to his/her interactions with stuff; and knowledge  and the world are the joint product of this interaction.  This view isn't necessarily idealist in the Berkeley sense -- according to which reality is simply an ensemble of mental representations.  But it is non-objectivist when it comes to the facts about the world: the facts are dependent upon a scheme of concepts within the context of which we characterize states of affairs.  And, at the same time, it permits us to assert that there are objective facts of the matter once we have settled on a conceptual scheme.This set of issues has special relevance to the philosophy of social science; I'll have to return to the topic in another posting."}, {"title": "Koestler's twentieth century", "date": "Tuesday, March 4, 2008", "text": "Arthur Koestler is most celebrated for his historical novel about the Moscow show trials, Darkness at Noon.  And the book is indeed a deeply revealing look at the heart of totalitarianism in the twentieth century -- the more so if you do a side-by-side reading of the trial of the fictional Rubashov and the transcripts of the trial of the historical Bukharin (Report of Court Proceedings in the Case of the Anti-Soviet Bloc of Rights and Trotskyites: Heard Before the Military Collegium of the Supreme Court).  Koestler caught the psychology and history of the period exactly right -- and he did it more or less as a contemporary observer, not an archival historian with leisurely access to the archives after the fact.But in some ways I find his autobiographical books even more gripping, and none more so than The invisible writing; An autobiography, published in 1954.The Invisible Writing is an amazing window onto some of the most important events of the twentieth century: the rise of Hitler, the struggles between Communists and Nazis in the streets of Berlin, the gradual decapitation of all forces of the left in Germany in the 1930s, the great famine in the Ukraine, and the cruelty of the Spanish Civil War.  Here is a telling description of a moment in time: \"With the constant dismissals at Ullstein's [the publisher], and the shadow of Hitler lying across the country like a monster-shaped cloud, our motley little crowd of intellectuals was too scared to be capable of any clear thought.  It was easy to win their sympathy for Russia, but almost impossible to make them take a determined stand for their own interests in Germany. The liberals in Germany -- and elsewhere -- have rarely understood that there are situations in which caution amounts to suicide.\"Koestler was situated in such a way as to be a participant-eyewitness in these world-historical events.  A few snapshots from this period -- street fighting in Berlin in 1932 between Communist workers and Nazi thugs; a train journey through the Ukraine during the worst of the deliberate war of famine that Stalin waged against the peasantry; Koestler's own denunciation of a loved one for a trivial suspicion; and a series of narrow escapes in fascist Spain (including a period of three months in a Franco prison under a sentence of death).Koestler's political adulthood witnessed his own movement from Communist journalist and activist in Berlin in the 1930s to a committed anti-Communist in the 1950s.  And his anti-Communism derived from his own honest willingness to confront the terrible truths of Stalinism -- Comintern's betrayal of the Spanish republicans, the Moscow show trials, the deliberate policy of famine as a tool of social war, and the repression and brutality of the Soviet state against its own citizens.The book provides absorbing, valuable reading.  And it offers deep lessons for us today -- about politics, about personal integrity, about the relationship between individuals and the state, and about the terrible power that ideology has wielded over humanity.What Koestler learned from his part of the twentieth century, and was able to express so evocatively in his writings, was a series of brutal facts about power: the power of a fascist state to destroy all organizations that might challenge its grip on society, the power of propaganda to conceal and falsify evident social realities, and the power of ideology to blind intellectuals to the meaning of the events unfolding around them.  Lies and coercion were the central realities of the state and the party -- both in Germany and in the Soviet Union.Koestler describes the central paradox of the Moscow show trials in these terms:To the western mind, unacquainted with the system and the rules, the confessions in the Trials appeared as one of the great enigmas of our time. Why had the Old Bolsheviks, heroes and leaders of the revolution, who had so often braved death that they called themselves 'dead men on furlough', confessed to these absurd and hair-raising lies? If one discounted those who were merely trying to save their necks, like Radek; and those who were mentally broken like Zinoviev; or trying to shield their families like Kameniev, who was said to be particularly devoted to his son--then there still remained a hard core of men like Bukharin, Piatakov, Mrachkovsky, Smirnov, and at least a score of other with a revolutionary past of thirty, forty years behind them, the veterans of Czarist prisons and Siberian exile, whose total and gleeful self-abasement remained inexplicable.  It was this 'hard core' that Rubashov was meant to represent.Here is a final, amazing twentieth century irony.  The lead prosecutor in the Moscow show trials (1936-38) -- the person who established the jurisprudence of coercion, intimidation, and the crushing subordination of the individual to the overwhelming power of the state, was Andrei Vyshinsky.  It was he who stage-managed the shameful miscarriage of justice that led to the executions of Zinoviev, Bukharin, Kamenev, and other leading Bolsheviks.  And it was the very same Andrei Vyshinsky who was the Soviet Union's chief delegate in 1949 in the drafting of ... the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.  Here, surely, we find a person with a fine understanding of human rights."}, {"title": "Micro cultures?", "date": "Sunday, March 2, 2008", "text": "Is there such a thing as a \"micro\"-culture -- a culture that is somewhat distinctive of a particular community in a specific time and place, and different from the culture of similar communities in other places?The sorts of communities I'm thinking of might include sports teams, university faculties, union locals, church congregations, street gangs, or rural villages.  Is it possible that Village X is a friendlier place than Village Y?  Or that Local W is more militant than Local Z?  Or that Gang S is less willing to use violence against younger brothers of rivals than Gang T is?  And is it possible that these differences are real, persistent, and self-reinforcing through mechanisms that constitute a basis for dynamic cultural continuity?Take the Boston Celtics.  The players and coaches are all recruited in a national and international labor market; they generally are well acquainted with each other through their high-profile college basketball careers, camps, and leagues; and the NBA spends a lot of money in cultivating a national NBA culture rather than a micro-culture for particular teams.  So you might imagine that every team would be simply a generic expression of national basketball culture.  And yet it's possible that the Boston Celtics are a distinctive team, in terms of a number of characteristics.  They might have more of a team ethic than, say, the Los Angeles Lakers; they might have some traditions that play out in practices and games; they might have a lore about the Celtics greats of the past -- Havliceck, Bird, Dennis Johnson, and they might conceivably have a style of play that persists through changes of coaches and players.  So here the question is whether the national culture of NBA basketball is the key, or whether there are important differences in behavior, values, practices, and style that persist for specific teams over time.  This speculation raises two sorts of questions: How would we attempt to determine whether there are such differences?  And what sorts of social mechanisms would serve to preserve and reproduce such cultural specifics?The basketball version of this story is pretty speculative on my part -- few of us have the close acquaintance with professional sports to have an opinion on the subject of local team cultures.  But university faculties -- that's a different story.  Here I feel more confident in asserting that there are indeed significant differences of culture across institutions, even institutions that are otherwise very similar.  Among select liberal arts colleges, for example, there are wide variations on different campuses about the value of \"university citizenship\" (service on college committees, for example); the expectations and duties associated with teaching undergraduate students (high commitment versus low commitment to spending time with students; a felt obligation to provide meaningful commentary on student writing assignments); and probably differences around the standards of what is acceptable in gender relations (for example, the acceptability of romantic relationships between faculty and students or senior faculty and junior faculty).  A little less tangibly -- it seems to me that there are visible differences on different college faculties concerning the depth and extent of social relationships among faculty members.  Some faculties are tight-knit, with a lot of socializing independent from official functions; and others are more distant, with few serious friendships among faculty members.  Some faculties give an impression of welcoming newcomers; others give a more standoffish or even unfriendly impression.  (As a young faculty member on the job market years ago I was very aware of the reputations that different philosophy departments had for the way in which they conducted interviews with prospective assistant professors.  One department was legendary for positioning the members of the search committee in a semi-circle surrounding the candidate, so that the candidate couldn't actually see everyone at once.)One way of rephrasing the question here is this: is the climate and culture of a place (a university or a basketball team) just the net result of the personalities and idiosyncracies of the group of people who happen to have been recruited into the group; or does the culture of the group have a certain normative persistence, capable of transmission to new arrivals?  The example of university faculties seems to support the second interpretation.  And in fact it seems possible to identify some of the social mechanisms through which this transmission occurs: for example, imitation, coaching and mentoring, social discipline, and the transmission of narratives of \"who we are at University X or College Y\".  The behaviors that are valorized through existing group members' practices and observations serve as a prescriptive model for the behaviors of more junior people.  And of course, these processes of transmission are imperfect and malleable.  The culture of a place changes over a period of several decades.So I am tempted to think that small communities do in fact make their own cultures over an extended period of time, and that these cultures -- values, practices, modes of inter-personal interaction, experiences of commitment -- have some degree of durability.  They do in fact succeed in changing the new recruits that come into the community, often enough to allow the mix of values and experiences that characterize the micro-culture to persist across multiple generations."}, {"title": "Paired comparisons", "date": "Thursday, February 28, 2008", "text": "Sidney Tarrow is a gifted and prolific student of comparative politics.  (Listen to my interview with Professor Tarrow.)  He has spent much of his career trying to understand social movements, contentious politics, and the causes of differences in political behavior across national settings.  And one of his special contributions is his ability to think clearly about the methods that social scientists use.Tarrow attaches a lot of weight to the idea of \"paired comparisons\" as a method of research and discovery: Locate a few cases that are broadly similar in many respects but different in a way that is important, interesting, or surprising.  Then examine the cases in greater detail to attempt to discover what explains the difference between the two cases. (One of his early books that employs this method is From center to periphery: Alternative models of national-local policy impact and an application to France and Italy.)Nothing special turns on \"pairs\" here; what Tarrow is describing is really the logic of small-N comparative research.  The point about the broad similarity that is the basis for choosing the cases follows from the logic of causation: if we presuppose that the outcome P is caused by some set of antecedent social and political conditions and we know that C1 and C2 have different outcomes -- then the more factors we can \"control\" for by finding cases in which these factors are constant, the better.  This is so, because it demonstrates that none of the constant factors in the two cases are the cause of variation in outcome.  And this limits our investigation of possible causes to the factors in which the cases differ.If this sounds like Mill's methods of similarity and difference, that's appropriate -- the logic is the same, so far as I can see.  Here is Mill's method of difference: A    B   C    D    -E => P A    B   -C    D    -E                    => -PAnd in this case -- making the heroic assumption that A,B,C,D,E exhaust all possible causes of P, and that the cause of P is deterministic rather than probabilistic -- then we can infer that the presence of C causes P.This reasoning doesn't take us to a valid conclusion to the effect that C is the only factor that is causally relevant to the occurrence of P; it is possible, for example, that there is a third case along these lines:-A    B    -C    D    -E                    => -PThis would demonstrate that A is a necessary condition for the occurrence of P; withhold A and P disappears.  And each of the other factors might also play a role as a necessary condition.  So it would be necessary to observe as many as 32 cases (2^5) in order to sort out the status of A through E as either necessary or sufficient conditions for the occurrence of P.  (The logic of this kind of causal reasoning is explored more fully in my essay, \"An Experiment in Causal Reasoning,\" which is also published in Microfoundations, Methods, and Causation.)But I don't think that Tarrow is intending to advance the method of paired comparison as a formal method of causal inference, along the lines of inductive or deductive logic.  Instead, I think he is making the plausible point that this method should be understood as a part of an intelligent research strategy.  Social processes are complex.  We are interested in explaining variation across cases.  And we probably have the best likelihood of discovering important causal relationships if we can reduce the number of moving parts (the other kinds of variation that occur across the cases).Tarrow gives an example of the application of the method of paired comparisions in the context of his early study of the political fortunes of the Italian Communist Party (PCI) in the south of Italy.  In this case the paired comparison involves northern Italy and southern Italy.  Both are subject to the same national political structures; both populations speak Italian; both populations have an Italian national identity.  However, the PCI was fairly successful in mobilizing support and winning elections based on a militant political program in the north, and was persistently unsuccessful in doing these things in the south.  What explains the difference?As Tarrow explains his reasoning, his expectation in conducting the research was a \"structural\" one.  He expected that there would be large structural factors in post-war Italy -- features of economic and political institutions -- that would explain the difference in outcome for PCI political activism.  And there were indeed large structural differences in social organization in the two regions.  Northern Italy possessed an economy in which industrial labor played a key role and constituted a substantial part of the population.  Southern Italy was agrarian and backward, with a large percentage of exploited peasants and only a small percentage of industrial workers.But, very significantly, Tarrow now believes that these \"structural\" expectations are probably too \"macro\" to serve as the basis of social explanation.  Instead, he favors the importance of looking at the dynamics of social processes and the specific causal mechanisms that can be discovered in particular social-historical settings.  This means looking for causal factors that work at a more strategic and meso level.  In terms of the southern Italian PCI outcome that he was interested in explaining thirty years ago -- he now believes that the causal mechanism of \"brokerage\" would have shed much more light on the political outcomes that were of interest in Italy.  (This is the heart of the approach that he takes, along with Doug McAdam and Chuck Tilly, in Dynamics of Contention.)This finding doesn't invalidate the heuristic of paired comparisons.  But it probably does invalidate the expectation that we might discover large \"structure-structure\" patterns of causation through such comparisons.  Instead, what the method facilitates is a more focused research effort on the part of the comparativist, in the context of which he/she can search out the lower-level causal mechanisms and processes that are at work in the various settings under study."}, {"title": "Is network analysis inconsistent with agent-centered explanation?", "date": "Monday, February 25, 2008", "text": "Quite a few researchers who study dynamic social processes are making use of some of the tools of network analysis.  And it is sometimes maintained that this approach is inconsistent with an agent-centered approach to social processes.  Some of these researchers take the view that \"it's not what is in the heads of various actors, but rather their relationships in networks that provide the causal underpinnings of social change.\"  And they sometimes maintain that the actor's psychological states can't even be identified in isolation from his/her social relationships. So, once again, explanation cannot rest upon facts about individuals alone. And this sort of finding is thought to cast doubt on methodological individualism in particular, and agent-centered explanatory strategies more generally.  (Chuck Tilly and co-authors sometimes take a view along these lines; for example, Doug McAdam, Sidney Tarrow and Charles Tilly, Dynamics of Contention.)There is something right about the intuition that we can't ground social explanations on assumptions that are too narrowly confined to features of individual psychology.  Individuals are socially constucted and socially developed, and our explanations of social processes needto reflect this fact. This is why I prefer the phrase \"methodological localism\" to \"methodological individualism.\" But both ontologies are agent-centered. So the question remains: does the causal salience of social networks demonstrate that agent-centered accounts are inherently incomplete -- or even worse, inherently unworkable (because we can't even specify the individual agent's powers and motives independently of his/her networks)?I don't think so, for several reasons. First, what is a network but a set of socially constructed agents in concrete relations with each other -- communication, coordination, power, subordination, and recognition?  The facts about the network are exhausted by a description of the social beliefs of the relevant actors and their material relations to each other.Second, it is certainly true that an agent's possibilities for exercising power are a function of facts beyond his/her own psychological characteristics. So Albert, the peasant activist in the tiny Breton village, is much more empowered than his psychological twin across the border in Normandy, by the fact that he alone has strong relationships with leaders in both the Catholic Church and the wine-growers' guild. His social networks permit him to amplify the scope of action and effect he may attempt. What this means is that Albert's social networks are a causal component in his ability to wield influence. In this sense it is reasonable as well to attribute causal status to the network and to characterize this standing as being independent of Albert as an individual.But it remains true that all of the causal powers associated with the network depend on the states of agency of the many persons who make it up. We therefore need to be able to provide an agent-centered account of the network's causal powers, distributed over the many agents who make it up. We must have \"microfoundations\" for the claim that the network exercises  social influence.  If the actors who constitute nodes within the network didn't have the right mental frameworks, motivational dispositions, or bodies of knowledge, then they would not in fact behave in a way that was sustaining of the network's social-causal properties.So, it seems inescapable that, when we say that \"Albert's power as a peasant activist depends upon the social fact that he is part of such-and-so networks\" -- that we have only uncovered another field of research where more agent-centered research is needed. The network's social-causal properties must themselves disaggregate onto a set of facts about the agents who constitute the network.  The current causal properties of the network and the agents who make it up are the complex and iterative result of many inter-related actions and alliances of prior generations of agents.And this in turn demonstrates that network analysis is by no means inconsistent with an agent-centered approach to social explanation.(See \"Levels of the social\" for more on this subject.)"}, {"title": "The flea market analogy", "date": "Friday, February 22, 2008", "text": "Is the flea market a helpful analogy for understanding the social world (\"The Dis-unity of Science\")?  Does it serve to provide a different mental model in terms of which to consider the nature of social phenomena?What it has going for it is heterogeneity and contingency, and an  obvious share of agent-dependency. The people who show up on a given  Saturday are a contingent and largely disorganized mix of humanity.  And the products that wind up on the jumble tables too are highly  disorderly and random. Each has its own unique story for how it got there. There is no overall guiding design.But there is also a degree of order underlying the apparent chaos of the jumble tables. All is not random in a flea market. The participants, for example: there are regular vendors, street people, police officers, health inspectors, jugglers, and pickpockets -- as well as regular shoppers, tourists, school children, and occasional shoppers looking for a used toaster or a single kitchen chair. In most cases there are reasons they are there -- and the reasons are socially interesting. Moreover, the ethnographer of the flea market is likely enough to spot some seasonal or social patterns in the products and people present in a certain month or time of year. So -- a blend of chaos and order.But the order that can be discerned is the result of a large number of overlapping, independent conditions and processes -- not the manifestation of a few simple forces or a guiding system of laws.Both accident and order are characteristic of the larger social world as well.  The helter-skelter of the flea market is in fact highly analogous to many aspects of social phenomena -- army recruitment, incidents of crime, mortgage defaults. But it is also true that there are other social phenomena that aren't so accidental. So the jumble sale is perhaps less good as an analogy for highly organized and managed social processes -- a tight administrative hierarchy, an orchestrated campaign event, or a coordinated attack in battle.This addresses the \"accidental conjunction\" part of the analogy. What about the \"composite order\" part of the analogy?  This element too works pretty well for many examples of social phenomena. When students of the professions discover that there are interesting patterns of recruitment into accountancy or the officer corps, or discover that there are similarities in the organizations of pharmacists and psychotherapists -- they also recognize that these patterns result from complex, intertwined patterns of strategic positioning, organizational learning, and economic circumstances. In other words, the patterns and regularities are themselves the result of multiple social mechanisms, motives, and processes. And these processes are in no way analogous to laws of nature.So, all considered, the analogy of the flea market works pretty well as a mental model for what we should expect of social phenomena: a degree of accident and conjunction, a degree of emerging pattern and order that results from many independent but converging social processes, and an inescapable dimension of agent-dependency that refutes any hope of discovering an underlying, law-governed system."}, {"title": "The \"dis\"-unity of social science", "date": "Wednesday, February 20, 2008", "text": "One of the central goals of Vienna Circle philosophy of science was the idea of the unity of science. The idea included at least two separable parts: methodological unity and unity of content under a single system of laws. On the methodological side there was the idea that the logic of explanation and confirmation should be the same in all the empirical sciences. If there were to be differences across disciplines, these should be heuristic rather than epistemic differences.  (Jordi Cat provides an extensive discussion of the unity of science doctrine in an article in the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy.)The more basic goal for unity was the idea of a single comprehensive theory that would, in principle, provide the foundation for the theories of all the special sciences. Physics was the intended foundation, and the goal was to demonstrate that all the fields of the natural sciences could be derived in principle from the laws of physics. For example, the hope was that the properties and laws of chemical elements and molecules should be derivable from fundamental physics.The reasons for wanting to see a unified physical theory were a preference for parsimony and simplicity and a metaphysical conviction that all of nature must really derive from a single set of fundamental laws.The fate of the unity of science doctrine can be pursued elsewhere. Here the question is whether there is a similar aspiration for the social sciences. The parallel principle could be stated along these lines: there should be some set of basic facts about individuals in social interactions that is sufficient to permit one to derive all varieties of social behavior, given relevant knowledge about context and boundary conditions.The attractions of such a unified social science are the same as in the natural science case: parsimony, simplicity, and comprehensiveness. And, in fact, unifying theories for social explanation are sometimes advanced. The most thorough-going attempt is the effort by rational choice theory and microeconomics to unify all social action as the consequence of preference-maximizing individual rationality within constraints.Attractive as this effort might be from an abstract or aesthetic perspective, it is profoundly misguided when if comes to understanding society. Social phenomena are not the law-governed consequences of a few underlying facts and features of individuals. Rather, they are the  contingent and mixed results of an inherently heterogeneous set of motives, psychologies, and institutions.  The fundamental problem is that the social world is not a system at all in the natural science sense. Instead, it is the contingent and dynamic sum of a variety of shifting processes and contexts.A better metaphor for the social world -- better than the metaphor of a table of billiard balls governed by the laws of mechanics -- is a large urban flea market. The wares on sale on a particular Saturday are simply the sum of the accidents of circumstance that led a collection of sellers to converge on that particular day. There are some interesting regularities that emerge over time -- in the spring one finds more used lawnmowers and in times of dearth one finds more family treasures. These regularities require explanation. But they do not derive from some governing \"law of flea markets\" that might be discovered. Instead, the flea market and the larger society are, alike, simply the aggregate result of large numbers of actions, motives, circumstances, and structures that turn kaleidoscopically and produce patterned but non-lawlike outcomes.So where does this take us with regard to \"unified social science\"? It leads us to expect something else entirely: rather than unity, we should expect eclectic theories, piecemeal explanations, and a patchwork of inquiries at a range of levels of description. Some explanatory theories will turn out to be more portable than others. But none will be comprehensive, and the social sciences will always remain open-ended and extensible. Instead of theoretical unification we might rather look for a more and more satisfactory coverage, through a range of disciplines and methods, of the aspects of the social world we judge most interesting and important. And these judgments can be trusted to shift over time.  And this means that we should be skeptical about the appropriateness of the goal of creating a unified social science.(See an earlier posting on \"Coverage of the Social Sciences\" for more relevant comments on this topic.)"}, {"title": "Politics and science", "date": "Tuesday, February 19, 2008", "text": "In the idealized version of science, the enterprise of scientific knowledge discovery follows its own logic without extraneous non-cognitive or non-rational influences.  But this is unrealistic.  Science is a social activity, conditioned by institutions, governments, and other social forces.  So it is worth considering how politics influences the course of science and how these influences affect the rationality or veridicality of the enterprise.  Does the fact of political influence on science make science either less rational or less true?There are at least two ways in which science can be affected by social or political factors: in terms of the formulation of research questions and priorities, and in terms of the content of the findings of scientific research. Pernicious examples of the second kind of influence are easy to find in the history of science.  For example, Stalin's insistence on the correctness of Lysenko's adaptationist theory of species led Soviet biology into a biological science that was profoundly untrue: organisms do not evolve according to the processes or mechanisms attributed to them by Lysenkoism.  So the political imperative from Stalin to the adoption of a particular scientific hypothesis led to erroneous science. It was also irrational science (because it depended on criteria of acceptance that were political rather than empirical). This form of influence of politics on science is clearly anti-scientific and anti-rational.  And, regrettably, we appear to have clear instances of this kind of substitution of political expediency for rational scientific judgment in the behavior of the current US administration, in the form of its efforts to control the content of scientific judgments about climate change (article).So one form of political influence on science is clearly anti-scientific.  When politicians substitute their wishes for the judgment of capable scientific researchers, it is inevitable that the result will be bad science.  And, of course, bad science is a bad basis for future problem-solving.But consider the other form of influence mentioned here: the setting of priorities for scientific research, especially through funding strategies.  Is this kind of influence inherently inconsistent with the empirical and rational claims of science?It is obvious that science is subject to this kind of influence.  When the National Institutes of Health decides to give higher priority to one kind of cancer rather than another, or to diabetes research over Alzheimer's research, this national institution is setting the agenda for university researchers throughout the country.  When the US government gave priority to space exploration research over atmospheric or oceanic research in the 1960s, it likewise gave encouragement to certain scientific disciplines and inhibition to others.  And, predictably, there was more progress in the scope and depth of scientific knowledge in some disciplines than others, following the spending priorities.  Science requires resources, and one of the duties of a democratic government is to decide about priorities in the expenditure of public moneys. What this kind of influence does not do, is to dictate the content of the findings.  Once the resources are committed, it is essential that the normal processes of science -- empirical study, peer review, experimentation, theory development -- should take place without interference from political or social pressure. So we might say that the \"priority-setting\" influence of politics on science is benign from the point of view of scientific rationality.  The political decision-makers decide what scientific problems are most important from the public's point of view; and the scientists, following the funding sources, then do their best to understand and solve those problems.  But this means that one of our crucial political goals ought to be to create and defend institutions that assure the political independence of scientists, so their research findings are the result of empirical investigation and theory formation rather than pressured conformance to the state's expectations.Now let's bring these ideas back to the social sciences.   Social science research has been subject to both kinds of political influence in American history.  There have sometimes been intense pressures on social scientists and historians about the content of their research -- for example, the field of China studies during the period of McCarthyism.  When social scientists arrive at unpalatable truths, they are sometimes subjected to shameful political pressures.  But second, the social sciences have certainly been shaped in the past forty years by the spending priorities of federal and non-profit funding agencies.  This influence isn't necessarily bad, or anti-scientific.  In fact, it is unavoidable.  But, in the social sciences especially, it may have the insidious effect of pushing social science research away from some difficult or controversial topics; and this may be so, even when those topics turn out to be particularly important for arriving at a better understanding of where our society is going."}, {"title": "What was E P Thompson up to?", "date": "Sunday, February 17, 2008", "text": "Let's think about E P Thompson. His 1963 book, Making of the English Working Class, transformed the way that historians on the left conceptualized \"social class.\" But what, precisely, was it about?Whereas other Marxist historians focused particularly on the large structures of capitalism, Thompson's eye was turned to the specific and often surprising details of artisanal and working culture in pre-industrial England, the many ways in which the working people at the bottom of English society conceived of themselves and created their own organizations for education and politics in the last half of the eighteenth century.  Neither peasant nor middle class, the many segments of working people in England were socially organized by trade and skill, and with remarkably distinct cultural traditions, songs, and political repertoires.  They were not, in fact, a \"class\".  And yet, they became a class -- this is the \"making\" that Thompson's title refers to.(Harvey Kaye's British Marxist Historians offers an excellent survey of the major British Marxist historians -- Hobsbawm, Hilton, Dobbs, Thompson, and others.)Commentators often describe Thompson's central contribution as being the provision of a detailed understanding of \"class consciousness\" in counterpart to Marx's conception of a \"class in itself\" -- a group of people defined in terms of their relation to the system of property relations.  On this line of interpretation, Thompson provided one of the missing links within Marxist theory, by demonstrating how the transition from \"class in itself\" to \"class for itself\" was accomplished.This is too simplistic a reading of Thompson, however.  For one thing, Thompson's book demonstrates the very great degree of contingency that attached to the historical construction of the English working class when we consider this process in cultural detail.  But to find that the process is contingent, is also to negate the Marxist idea that there is a necessary and direct connection between a group's structural position in the property system and its social consciousness.  For another and related reason, Thompson's story goes well beyond Marx's in its emphasis on the independent agency of English working people.  Their organizations, their ideas, and their political strategies were not simply derivative of the structural situation of \"labor and capital\", but rather were the result of specific acts of leadership, creativity, and popular mobilization.So let's consider the main elements of Thompson's historiography.  What was his goal as a historian of this period of England's social history?   In writing the book, Thompson took a huge step forward in creating the field of social history, and he established a paradigm of historical writing that guided a generation of historians.  His goal is almost ethnographic: he wants to discover the many threads of thought and culture that passed through the many segments of English working people.  He takes ideas and ideology very seriously -- and recognizes that the ideas of English Methodism and the rhetoric of liberty were profoundly important in these segments of English society.  In particular, the ideas and the modes of organization that were associated with Methodism, were deeply formative for the laborers' and artisans' consciousness that was being forged.Just as important as these elements of \"high\" culture, Thompson articulates his concept of the \"moral economy\" of the crowd -- the idea that there is a shared set of norms in popular culture that underlie social behavior.  He identifies popular disturbance -- riots, strikes, and expressions of grievances of various kinds -- as a crucial indicator of political behavior and popular consciousness.  And he tries to demonstrate that the popular disturbances of the eightheenth and nineteenth centuries were governed by a set of norms that were popularly observed and enforced -- about price, about social obligation, and about justice. The \"bread riot\" was not a chaotic or impulsive affair. And this becomes an important theme in the consciousness of the working class that Thompson describes: a consciousness that denounces political oppression as deeply as it decries exploitation.In other words, Thompson's version of working class consciousness invokes liberty and justice as much as it does deprivation and material factors.  \"In the end, it is the political context as much as the steam-engine, which had most influence on the shaping consciousness and institutions of the working class\" (197).  \"The people were subjected simultaneously to an intensification of two intolerable forms of relationship: those of economic exploitation and of political oppression\" (198).The culmination of this retelling of the multi-threaded histories of English working people is indeed \"a working class consciousness\" -- a more or less coherent social and political philosophy that supported a political program and a morality of equality and solidarity.  \"Thus working men formed a picture of the organization of society, out of their own experience and with the help of their hard-won and erratic education, which was above all a political picture. They learned to see their own lives as part of a general history of conflict between the loosely defined 'industrial classes' on the one hand, and the unreformed House of Commons on the other.  From 1830 onwards a more clearly defined class concsiousness, in the customary Marxist sense, was maturing, in which working people were aware of continuing both old and new battles on their own\" (712).Thompson's book remains an innovative and pathbreaking classic -- and one that can continue to provide new ideas about how to understand society.(See this post on ChangingSociety for more discussion of E. P. Thompson.)"}, {"title": "Social science and social problems", "date": "Saturday, February 16, 2008", "text": "Several of the interviews that I\u2019ve conducted in recent weeks have agreed on an important point: that the social sciences ought to be directed towards addressing important social problems, and that the research agenda for social science ought to be influenced or shaped by the constituencies in society who are most affected by these social problems.  At bottom \u2013 the social sciences ought to be engaged in a serious way in improving the quality of life for the people of the globe.  They can best do this, it would seem, by discovering some of the causes of persistent social problems and providing a sound basis for designing policies that have a chance of ameliorating them.  And they can focus their research agendas by working closely with practitioners and the ordinary people who experience these social problems.What is the reality, however?  To what extent do the social sciences conform to this ideal?  As David Featherman expresses in his interview, the social sciences in the United States in the 1950s and 1960s took a turn away from goals of social engagement and problem solving, and they really haven\u2019t yet turned back.  Instead, the major social science disciplines took on the model of disinterested, academic theory formation. The natural sciences provided the role model, and the driving goals were quantifiability, theoretical parsimony, and formalizability. \u201cApplied\u201d research was devalued.Re-establishing the connection between social science and social problems should be a high priority for all of us -- social scientists and citizens alike.  The social problems we face are crucially important, they are intractable, and they are often trending in the wrong direction.  Consider this partial list of particularly pressing problems facing our society and the world.United StatesEndemic urban povertyRacial segregationUrban decline and despairRising inequalities of income, wealth, and quality of lifeLack of universal provision of health servicesRising social cost of health careFailing delivery of education for children and adolescentsInternational --deepening poverty in many countriesdeepening inequalities of wealth, income, and quality of lifeViolence against individuals and groupsEthnic violence   Genocide   Crime   Thuggery   Oppressive statesOppression of women and girlsGlobal environmental crisis   Climate change   Resource exhaustion   Environment degradationPolitical regimes   Persistent authoritarian regimes   Imperfect democraciesCorruption   Inadequate systemic response to disasterThese are all problems with massive consequences for human wellbeing.   Each of them is itself the manifestation of complex social and behavioral forces.  And solutions will require the artful design of new institutions and new ways of coordinating social behavior.  In short -- these are problems that are much more challenging, intellectually and practically, than decoding the human genome or controlling a nuclear reactor or putting a human on Mars.  The best efforts of talented and committed researchers will be needed in order to understand and change these conditions.Fortunately, there are some signs that mainstream social scientists are beginning to turn their gaze back in the direction of concrete social problems. There is significant, sustained work going on in sociology and political science on the topics of poverty, inequality, racial segregation, and social disaffection, and this work is taking on some of the urgency and relevance that was displayed in the research of the Chicago school of sociology seventy-five years ago. The Center for Advancing Research and Social Solutions at the University of Michigan is an example of a group of researchers coming together with a commitment to bringing social science research to bear on social problems.  (See the Featherman interview for a description of CARSS.)  A recent symposium published in The Yard, Harvard\u2019s Faculty of Arts and Sciences magazine, features a group of Harvard social scientists under the heading, \u201cThe New Social Science,\u201d and the discussion focuses almost entirely on these social problems and some of the methods that can be used to address them.  Featured in the article are Edward Glaeser, William Julius Wilson, Mary Waters, Claudia Gay, David Cutler, and Robert Putnam.  (Unfortunately this publication doesn\u2019t have a web presence.)  It is very good to see research at this level of empirical detail and practical focus coming into the spotlight.There seem to be two large meta-goals that the social sciences should have in confronting social problems.  One is the problem of understanding these problems in detail \u2013 both the empirical details of how the problem is distributed and evolving, and the causal issue of discovering some of the factors that produce and reproduce the problem.  What are the trends in urban and suburban social evolution?  Why is urban poverty so intractable over multiple generations? Why have urban schools been unsuccessful in providing a high-quality education to all the children that they serve?The second large meta-goal for the social sciences is to be able to provide a basis for policies and interventions that have a meaningful probability of solving the problems that we care about.  Policies should be driven by the best possible understanding of the social and behavioral dynamics of the problems they are designed to address.  And the social sciences should endeavor to provide sober assessments of the likely consequences of various proposed policies.But nothing is simple in social life \u2013 and it is clear enough that there are complex interactive causal processes at work in the creation and sustenance of most social problems.  The scope of prediction in the social sciences is limited, and this means that it is rarely possible to provide a categorical prescription such as this: \u201cdo this, and such-and-so will result.\u201d   Instead, the social sciences are perhaps most useful when they help to identify some of the behavioral complexities that might turn into \u201cunforeseen consequences\u201d \u2013 and thereby help to design policies that are more fault-tolerant.None of this is simple.  But there is no doubt that our society needs the knowledge and methods that the social sciences can provide, if we are to have a good chance of solving the problems we face.  And this means that the social sciences need to take on the task of practical engagement with seriousness and commitment."}, {"title": "Agent-based modeling as social explanation", "date": "Friday, February 15, 2008", "text": "Logical positivism favored a theory of scientific explanation that focused on subsumption under general laws.  We explain an outcome by identifying one or more general laws, a set of boundary conditions, and a derivation of the outcome from these statements.  A second and competing theory of scientific explanation can be called \"causal realism.\" On this approach, we explain an outcome by identifying the causal processes and mechanisms that give rise to it.  And we explain a pattern of outcomes by identifying common causal mechanisms that tend to produce outcomes of this sort in circumstances like these.  (If we observe that patterns of reciprocity tend to break down as villages become towns, we may identify the causal mechanism at work as the erosion of the face-to-face relationships that are a necessary condition for reciprocity.)But there are other approaches we might take to social explanation and prediction.  And one particularly promising avenue of approach is \"agent-based simulation.\"  Here the basic idea is that we want to explain how a certain kind of social process unfolds.  We can take our lead from the general insight that social processes depend on microfoundations at the level of socially situated individuals. Social outcomes are the aggregate result of intentional, strategic interactions among large numbers of agents.  And we can attempt to implement a computer simulation that represents the decision-making processes and the structural constraints that characterize a large number of interacting agents.Thomas Schelling's writings give the clearest exposition to the logic of this approach Micromotives and Macrobehavior.  Schelling demonstrates in a large number of convincing cases, how we can explain large and complex social outcomes, as the aggregate  consequence of behavior by purposive agents pursuing their goals within constraints.  He offers a simple model of residential segregation, for example, by modeling the consequences of assuming that blue residents prefer neighborhoods that are at least 50% blue, and red residents prefer neighborhoods at least 25% red.  The consequence -- a randomly distributed residential patterns becomes highly segregated in an extended series of iterations of individual moves.It is possible to model various kinds of social situations by attributing a range of sets of preferences and beliefs across a hypothetical set of agents -- and then run their interactions forward over a period of time.  SimCity is a \"toy\" version of this idea -- what happens when a region is developed by a set of players with a given range of goals and resources?  By running the simulation multiple times it is possible to investigate whether there are patterned outcomes that recur across numerous timelines -- or, sometimes, whether there are multiple equilibria that can result, depending on more or less random events early in the simulation.Robert Axelrod's repeated prisoners' dilemma tournaments represent another such example of agent-based simulations. (Axelrod demonstrates that reciprocity, or tit-for-tat, is the winning strategy for a population of agents who are engaged in a continuing series of prisoners' dilemma games with each other.)  The most ambitious examples of this kind of modeling (and predicting and explaining) are to be found in the Santa Fe Institute's research paradigm involving agent-based modeling and the modeling of complex systems. Interdisciplinary researchers at the University of Michigan pursue this approach to explanation at the Center for the Study of Complex Systems.  (Mathematician John Casti describes a number of these sorts of experiments and simulations in Would-Be Worlds: How Simulation is Changing the Frontiers of Science and other books.)This approach to social analysis is profoundly different from the \"subsumption under theoretical principles\" approach, the covering-law model of explanation.  It doesn't work on the assumption that there are laws or governing regularities pertaining to the social outcomes or complex systems at all.  Instead, it attempts to derive descriptions of the outcomes as the aggregate result of the purposive and interactive actions of  the many individuals who make up the social interaction over time.  It is analogous to the simulation of swarms of insects, birds, or fish, in which we attribute very basic \"navigational\" rules to the individual organisms, and then run forward the behavior of the group as the compound of the interactive decisions made by the individuals.   (Here is a brief account of studies of swarming behavior.)How would this model of the explanation of group behavior be applied to real problems of social explanation?  Consider one example: an effort to tease out the relationships between transportation networks and habitation patterns.  We might begin with a compact urban population of a certain size.  We might then postulate several things:The preferences that each individual has concerning housing costs, transportation time and expense, and social and environmental environmental amenities.The postulation of a new light rail system extending through the urban center into lightly populated farm land northeast and southwestThe postulation of a set of prices and amenities associated with possible housing sites throughout the region to a distance of 25 milesThe postulation of a rate of relocation for urban dwellers and a rate of immigration of new residentsNow run this set of assumptions forward through multiple generations, with individuals choosing location based on their preferences, and observe the patterns of habitation that result.This description of a simulation of urban-suburban residential distribution over time falls within the field of economic geography. It has a lot in common with the nineteenth-century von Thunen's Isolated State analysis of a city's reach into the farm land surrounding it.  (Click here for an interesting description of von Thunen's method written in 1920.)  What agent-based modeling adds to the analysis is the ability to use plentiful computational power to run models forward that include thousands of hypothetical agents; and to do this repeatedly so that it is possible to observe whether there are groups of patterns that result in different iterations.  The results are then the aggregate consequence of the assumptions we make about large numbers of social agents -- rather than being the expression of some set of general laws about \"urbanization\".And, most importantly, some of the results of the agent-based modeling and modeling of complexity performed by scholars associated with the Santa Fe Institute demonstrate the understandable novelty that can emerge from this kind of simulation.  So an important theme of novelty and contingency is confirmed by this approach to social analysis.There are powerful software packages that can provide a platform for implementing agent-based simulations; for example, NetLogo.  Here is a screen shot from an implementation called \"comsumer behavior\" by Yudi Limbar Yasik.  The simulation has been configured to allow the user to adjust the parameters of agents' behavior; the software then runs forward in time through a number of iterations.  The graphs provide aggregate information about the results."}, {"title": "\"Folk\" sociology", "date": "Tuesday, February 12, 2008", "text": "All of us are sociologists, at some level.  We have social concepts in terms of which we analyze the social world around us -- \"boss,\" \"working class guy,\" \"politician,\" \"evangelical\", \"millennial generation\".  (Stereotypes of groups defined in terms of race and class probably fall in that category.)  We operate on the basis of stylized schemata about social causes -- what sorts of things influence what other things.  And we operate with some stylized social facts.  (\"Bad economic times make people more suspicious,\" \"Big cities are more unsafe than towns,\" \"Elections are decided by big campaign contributions,\" \"Midwestern people are more socially conservative than Californians.\")  Putting all these sorts of assumptions together, we can say that we possess a conceptual framework and causal theory of the social world, which helps us to navigate the social relationships, conflicts, and needs that we have in ordinary life. Action proceeds on the basis of a representation of the world.What this comes down to is the obvious point that humans are cognitive beings who undertake to conceptualize and explain the world around them; they come up with conceptual schemes and causal hypotheses about how things work, and they construct their plans and actions around these frameworks.  We are \"cognitive\" -- we undertake to represent the world around us, based on observation and the creation of organizing concepts.  And, of course, many of those concepts and hypotheses are badly grounded; they don't divide the world in a way that is really illuminating, or they offer stereotypes about how things work that aren't actually true.  (\"Don't bet on red -- it's come up four times in a row, so it's not likely to come up next time.\" That's a false statement about a series of randomly generated red and black events, and the player who follows this rule will lose to the player who is guided by probability theory.)This sort of everyday social cognition is similar to what philosophers of psychology call \"folk psychology\" -- the ordinary categories of thought and action that we attribute to each other in order to describe and explain each other's behavior (intention, belief, pain, anger, ...).  And philosophers have asked whether there is any relation at all between folk psychology and scientific psychology.  (Ian Ravenscroft treats this issue in the philosophy of psychology in his article in the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy.)  Some philosophers have argued that the most fundamental and scientifically satisfactory explanations of individual behavior will be couched in terms that bear no relation at all to the concepts of ordinary mentalistic psychology.So what is the status of folk sociology?  We can ask several questions about this common sense framework of social cognition and expectation.  First, where does it come from?  What are the social processes of learning through which we arrive at the specifics of the social assumptions and concepts that we employ?  Second, to what extent are there important differences across individuals with respect to the features of their social frameworks?  (For example, we can explore whether there are cultural and national differences, gender and race differences, or generational differences across different groups and cohorts.) Third, we can examine the degree to which these categories and assumptions are rigid, or whether they are open to modification through additional experience -- \"learning\".A different question, though, is also important: What is the relationship between these ordinary sociological frameworks and scientific sociology?  Is there a relationship at all? Can scientific sociology learn from common sense?  And can common sense improve its grasp of the social world through interaction with scientific sociology?  Might we speculate that ordinary common sense does a fairly good job of picking out the salient features of the social world?  Or, on the contrary, might we judge that the categories of \"folk\" sociology are about as misleading as pre-modern, magical concepts of nature?  Or perhaps, might we say that rigorous scientific sociology can serve to refine and improve upon our \"folk\" concepts of the social world -- lead us to abandon categories such as race, for example, in our efforts to understand Obama, Michael Jordan, and DuBois?The example of the natural sciences would lead us to one set of answers on these questions: \"folk\" knowledge of the natural world was not in fact a good guide to scientific physics, and the concepts of modern physics bear little intelligible relationship to common sense concepts of ordinary experience of tables and chairs.  One way of putting this is to say that physics concepts are \"theoretical\", whereas common sense concepts are \"phenomenological\" (based on immediate experience).Whether that is a valid distinction or not in physics, it probably is not a valid distinction in the social sciences.  Social life is more transparent than the physical world; so our best scientific understanding of the social ought to bear some understandable relationship to the categories of ordinary social cognition.  Common sense may not be highly specific in theorizing the concept of \"power\" in social life; but the phenomena of power are in fact fairly visible, and ordinary common sense captures these phenomena reasonably well.  It is possible to paraphrase virtually any esoteric sociological thesis about power, in terms that are understandable in ordinary social experience.  And likewise for exploitation, alienation, disaffection, racism, prejudice, discrimination, and affinity groups (to list a grab bag of sociological concepts): each of these concepts can be related to ordinary experiences and ordinary, common sense categories of social interaction.So here is a possible answer to our original question -- how do ordinary social concepts relate to those of scientific sociology?  We can say that there ought to be a critical but intelligible relationship between the two sets of concepts.  Scientific sociology can point out the limitations and blind spots of ordinary ways of representing the social world.  But ordinary social observation and conceptualization constitute the real content of sociological hypothesis and theory. So both systems of social knowledge fruitfully interact with each other, and -- ideally -- lead to a rising level of competence in cognizing and understanding society."}, {"title": "A normative aspect to power", "date": "Monday, February 11, 2008", "text": "It sometimes seems as though there is a normative dimension to our concept of power.  What if we defined \"power\" in these terms: an agent exercises power when he/she undertakes to compel individuals or groups to act in ways they prefer not to act, against their interests and without the justification of a legitimate state underwriting the compulsion. Notice that the last qualification entails that the exercise of power is by definition \"illegitimate\"; legitimate authority compels behavior but does not exercise power. So on this definition, there is a behavioral element and a normative element in the proposition that \"A exercises power over B\": A compels behavior by B and A does not have a legitimate political or moral right to do so.This might appear to be largely a semantic question: what do we mean by \"power\"?  Is the exercise of the enforcement of law within a procedurally and substantively just polity an exercise of \"power\"? Or is it rather the exercise of rightful authority? Certainly it is correct to observe that the behavioral aspect of involuntary compulsion is present in both types of cases.  The criminal who is imprisoned for his crimes is treated coercively, in that he is confined against his will; so the state has the ability to \"compel individuals to act contrary to their will\".   If we took the element of compulsion and coercion as uniquely central, then both the lawful state and the extortion gang are exercising power -- over criminals and innocent citizens respectively.  If, on the other hand, we think that coercively backed authority is something different from \"power\", then a democratically established legal authority cannot be said to be exercising power over its citizens (though it may do so over its international adversaries).If we go down this road in analyzing power, then there is a close relationship between power, social justice, and democracy.How would we decide this question?  And does it have any importance for the purposes of social and political explanation, or for the design of social policies?Political and social power involves the exercise of social resources to compel various kinds of unwilling behavior by others.  What creates power in society?  What are the sorts of social and structural factors that permit individuals to exercise power? And what features of personality lead a given individual to choose to use the instruments of power to achieve his/her will?  In short -- how does power pertain to \"structure\" and \"agency\"?This is one of the categories in social analysis that requires that we bring together both agency and structure.  Individuals wield power; but they only do so on the basis of resources and advantages that are conferred upon them by existing social relations.  The enduring social relations that exist in a society -- for example, property relations, administrative and political relations, or the legal system -- constitute a structure within which agents act, and they determine the distribution of crucial social resources that become the raw materials on the basis of which agents exercise power over other individuals and groups.  So the particular details of a social structure are crucial in determining the forms of power that exist in the society.  For example, a privileged position within the property system -- the possession of significant income and wealth -- confers a resource advantage on people in that position.  They can use their wealth to solicit powerful allies; they can purchase media outlets; they can influence politicians -- all with an eye to achieving their goals in spite of the contrary wishes or interests of others.Likewise, a privileged position in the communications system -- a television news producer or newspaper publisher, for example -- can use his/her position to alter the way in which stories are presented in such a way as to change the way the public thinks about the issues; and these changes in thought can lead to changes in behavior.  And an elected official can exercise power by setting the agenda for others -- by including or excluding various options from consideration.So one's position within these various social structures -- systems of social relations -- determines the volume of social resources upon which one can call in the effort to constrain or compel the actions of others.  Position determines one's capacity for power.  But it does not determine the exercise of power.  To be said to exercise power, it is necessary to have the goal of compelling people to do things they don't want to do. This is where agency or the \"will to power\" comes in.  It is possible for a person with access to great power resources to nonetheless behave in ways that do not make use of power but rather depend on building consent and consensus.  We might contrast Churchill with Stalin in mobilizing society for war; Churchill persuaded the British people to sacrifice in support of the war effort, whereas Stalin used the coercive power of the state to achieve his war mobilization goals.This fact suggests that we need to consider something of the psychology of power.  This is a topic that Adorno and other critical theorists invoked through the concept of the \"authoritarian personality\" -- an idea invoked largely in an effort to understand fascism.  Others might attempt to assimilate the willingness to use power under the category of \"opportunistic\" or \"instrumentalist\" decision-making: coercion is considered as simply one out a menu of feasible strategies for achieving one's will.  (This is perhaps the foundation of Hobbes's understanding of the pursuit and use of power.)  And here we might speculate that the \"democratic personality\" is a set of dispositions to behavior that lead the agent to seek out persuasion and consensus rather than force, deception, and coercion as instruments through which to achieve one's goals.  (Taken to the limit, we might say that a proper democracy creates an environment in which there is neither opportunity nor impulse towards the exercise of power.)On this way of laying out the landscape of power, there are several dimensions to be considered: the social arrangements that make it possible for some individuals to pressure, coerce, and compel other individuals to do their bidding; the social arrangements that create profound conflicts of interest in the context of which the incentive to wield power naturally arises; and the circumstances of  social psychology and personality that lead some individuals to choose to make use of resources of power to coerce, while others choose strategies that depend on willing consent to achieve collective purposes."}, {"title": "Large social forces?", "date": "Saturday, February 9, 2008", "text": "We often analyze the world around us in terms of large social forces and trends -- globalization, the rise of ethnic identities, the spread of global capitalism, the rise of China as a coming super-power.  These large forces are the \"folk theories\" through which we try to make sense of the world as it changes around us. But do these constructs actually make sense from an analytical, social scientific point of view? Or are they more akin to the large supra-historical categories advanced by pseudo-historians such as Toynbee or Spengler?One reason for drawing that last conclusion is a justified skepticism about large impersonal social causes. We need to know what the microfoundations are, the concrete local mechanisms through which any social force works -- and merely postulating that \"the forces of globalization are producing more social unrest\", for example, doesn't provide the necessary illumination at that level.This critical concern comes along with another: the observation that \"folk\" concepts of large social forces (for example, \"spread of extremism\" or \"globalization\") often encompass a pretty wide and heterogeneous set of lower-level processes. Presumably globalization works differently in Australia, Kenya, and London.  So the term is more of an umbrella than a specific theory of how the world works.But all of this said -- is there any rigorous and scientifically justifiable use for the idea of large social forces?I think there is such a use. The concerns just mentioned are entirely valid. But they don't exclude the possibility that there are some processes of change in the world that are large and systemic, and that do have the requisite degree of microfoundations at the disaggregated levels. The examples I can think of come largely from the economic realm, but I am sure we could come up with cultural and social examples too.--- The global effects of the Great Depression  in the 1930s. The stock market crash of 1929 created financial and business consequences all over the United States. And the alterations in demand and price for commodities such as cotton or coal had consequences throughout the world. Small peasant farmers in North China were forced to reconfigure their cropping regimes as a result of events that took place on Wall Street. So we can say that the Great Depression was a large social force and one whose consequences were global in scope.--- The Asian financial crisis of 1997 likewise created a cascading series of effects that were eventually felt everywhere in the world.--- The SARS epidemic of 2002-2003 was an example of the possibility of global pandemic caused by the rapid transmission of exposure from China to Canada through the air travel system.In each case we have an example of a large social cause. And we have a good understanding of the \"transmission belt\" through which these local events can have global consequences. It is the degree of integration among separate agents and groups that is created by national and global markets, communications systems, and transportation systems. Markets have foundations that are both global and local. They signal future events to millions of independent actors throughout space. These actors modify their behavior. And these shifts in turn create new market situations. So the rapid transmission of information, people, and products constitutes the microfoundational account that is needed for asserting the large social force.There are similar stories that can be told for the transmission of ideas and cultural variations -- e.g.  new forms of Christian or Muslim activism.  (Stephen Greenblatt has some great examples of the transmission of cultural ideas in Marvelous Possessions: The Wonder of the New World.)So the forces of globalization are real enough. And they depend upon mechanisms of transmission that create a systemic interdependence of behavior in widely separated places. Moreover, the examples give us an idea about how to characterize the idea that \"globalization is changing the world.\" We can break this claim down into the idea -- an empirical one -- that asserts that there is a rising level of integration across societies, achieved by communications systems, transportation systems, and economic interdependency, through which the actions of people in Indonesia and the UK are much more systemically interconnected than they were a century ago.   The analytical task is to be as specific as possible in identifying the pathways through which global influence of a factor is achieved, and not to engage in lazy thinking about big social forces that we really don't understand."}, {"title": "Social progress in India?", "date": "Thursday, February 7, 2008", "text": "How much social progress has India made since Independence sixty years ago?  According to economist V. K. Ramachandran, not very much when it comes to life in the countryside.  (Hear my interview with Ramachandran on iTunes and on my web page.)   Ramachandran gives a profile of the social problems faced by India at the time of Independence -- depths of income poverty, illiteracy, avoidable disease, and the worst forms of caste, class and gender oppression in the world -- and then judges that, appallingly, these same problems continue in the countryside without significant change.  And this failure derives from the country's failure to solve its agrarian question.  Poverty, inequality, and deprivation continue to be rampant in rural society.  And this persistence derives from the failure to address the fundamental relations of property and power in the countryside.  Moreover, the processes of globalization and liberalization have, if anything, intensified these problems.Professor Ramachandran is a research professor at the Indian Statistical Institute in Kolkata, and is the author of Wage Labour and Unfreedom in Agriculture: An Indian Case Study.Professor Ramachandran takes issue with the view of India that appears to be emerging in Japan and the United States -- as a country with shopping malls, hi-tech companies, and rapid economic growth.  These images are true of some places in India -- but they have little relevance to conditions in rural India.  (And the population of India continues to be at least 70% rural and agricultural.)  The progress that has occurred in the countryside is meaningful -- agriculture has increased its productivity significantly since 1960, and India is now grain-self-sufficient.  India is no longer locked into a \"ship-to-mouth\" existence.  But these changes in the productivity of agriculture have not been associated with changes in the basic institutions present in the countryside -- what Ramachandran refers to as the \"agrarian structure.\"  And these social relations continue to create a system that entrenches inequality and deprivation for peasants and agricultural workers. Ramachandran maintains that three \"new\" inequalities have emerged -- inequalities between regions, inequalities between crops, and inequalities between classes.  (As an expert on agricultural workers, Ramachandran is in a good position to observe what has happened for this segment of India's rural population.)Ramachandran is an activist-scholar, and he is involved in a large collaboration with other scholars to provide a review of conditions in villages in a growing list of states in India. Ramachandran underlines the point that there is great variation across the map of India.  The goal of these studies is to provide a detailed snapshot of the social conditions in the villages -- studies of the oppressed classes, tribes, and women; the state of village amenities (sewerage, clean water, roads, education).  Over a number of years the goal of the research effort is to arrive at a more nuanced description of the conditions of rural life across many states in India. This research is highly valuable, since it permits disaggregation of descriptions of the countryside that are often based on aggregated data.An interesting feature of this research project is the fact that it is deliberately linked to the activist organizations of peasants, workers, and women.  The researchers consult with the agrarian activists to discover what the most important issues are -- and then to focus research effort on discovering the social details associated with these issues.  And Ramachandran is emphatic in saying that the rigor of scientific investigation can and should be combined with this collaboration with the activist organizations.  In fact, he indicates that the organizations themselves are insistent about this point.  \"Don't lose your academic rigor,\" the leaders of the organizations insist.There is a lot more in the interview.  But the bottom line is that Ramachandran offers a really good example of the engaged scholar.  And the kind of social research that he and his colleagues are doing is well designed to help to diagnose some of the changes and public policies that are needed in India."}, {"title": "Reasoning about agents", "date": "Tuesday, February 5, 2008", "text": "Rational choice theory usually advances a highly abstract theory of decision-making -- utility-maximizing choice among discrete options -- and then draws deductive conclusions. But actual human reasoners don't look much like this abstract ideal.  It is interesting to consider how much one can explain while weakening the heroic assumptions about agent rationality. It turns out that it is possible to explain quite a bit of social behavior on the basis of a theory of agency that incorporates only a few qualitative assumptions about practical agency: purposiveness, deliberation, comparison, and choice -- without the specific mathematics of utility theory.  And this gives a basis for a \u201cpractical agency\u201d type of social explanation that doesn\u2019t fall directly under the many criticisms that are offered of formal rational choice theory. And it represents a framework of analysis that corresponds fairly directly to Aristotle\u2019s conception of deliberation.First, purposiveness. We assume that agents have purposes -- states of affairs that they want to bring about. Their actions are intended to bring about their goals.  (This is the basic assumption of means-end rationality.)Second, deliberation. We assume that agents collect information about the courses of action that are feasible in the moment. And they collect information about the likely consequences of the various actions that they are considering. Within a deliberative process they choose an action to pursue.Third, comparison. We assume that the agent deliberates by considering the advantages and disadvantages of each action (costs and benefits) and the degree to which the possible or probable effects of the choice serve the set of purposes the agent pursues. Further, the agent may compare choices on the basis of the nature of the action itself rather than solely on the basis of consequences -- that is, the agent may combine deontological considerations with utilitarian considerations (this represents an element of Kant\u2019s theory of moral decision-making).  That is, the agent chooses on the basis of full comparison of the choices.So far we have described purposive deliberation without invoking utilities. We have invoked the idea of preference in this account, because we have assumed that the agent prefers outcomes that better fulfill his/her purposes. And we have likewise invoked comparison and the idea of \u201cmore and less\u201d of something in ranking outcomes. The apparatus of utility theory is one way of articulating or modeling these features -- but we are not forced to attribute a full apparatus of utility measurement and aggregation in order to attribute purposiveness and comparison. It will suffice if the agent can judge \"X is better than Y in fulfilling my purposes.\"So let's refer to this less abstract description as a \u201cbroad theory of purposive agency\u201d. The question here is a simple one: does this description give us enough to get a social explanation going? I believe that it does, and that this demonstrates that the conception of agents as purposive decision-makers is more durable than any particular formal theory of decision-making.I support this observation with a single inconclusive illustration. We can reproduce the public goods problem, and the derivation of the rationality of free-riding, using only the comparative resources of the reduced theory of agency. And we can simultaneously prepare a theoretical location for future empirical research for those instances where free-riding does not materialize as expected.First the derivation of the tendency toward free riding in the presence of public goods. The agent has preferences among the possible outcomes of possible collective action. He/she recognizes that the probability of realizing the collective good is not significantly altered by participation. Agent further recognizes that there is a cost to participation. Agent decides to not participate, based on costs and outcomes: the benefit of participation and non-participation is equal and the cost of participation is greater, so non-participation is preferred.But now consider what happens when we turn on a deontological component of the comparison. Agent notes that non-participation involves taking unfair advantage of the actions of others. Agent prefers actions that are fair. Agent therefore chooses participation.Finally, we might further complicate things by allowing that agent allows tradeoffs between the cost-benefit comparison and the deontological comparison. In some instances the weight of fairness prevails and agent chooses the less-good alternative.  In other cases the situation reverses. Agent sacrifices minor unfairness and chooses the better outcome.There are many, many examples of explanations in sociology, anthropology, and history that account for an outcome based on analysis of the situation of deliberation confronting a hypothetical set of purposive agents; and substantial explanations ensue.  (As one example, consider Jean Ensminger\u2019s explanation of Kenyan cattle-tending and bride price practices as a solution to a principal-agent problem between cattle owners and cattle tenders; Making a Market: The Institutional Transformation of an African Society.)"}, {"title": "Power and violence in China", "date": "Saturday, February 2, 2008", "text": "Several recent postings on this blog have focused on power. Ultimately power depends upon a threat of violence.   And recent reports from China have thrown the spotlight on the use of violence against innocent citizens who are challenging one aspect of power or another.  The photo at left is taken from a news story reporting the results of homeowners' protests in a Beijing neighborhood against unplanned buildings on the greenspace of their neighborhood.  (Reportage and more photos are available here.)What this incident reflects is a disturbing and apparently growing incidence of the use of violence by private security companies against groups of citizens in China who are engaging in a variety of efforts to protect their interests or advance their claims.  These incidents of violence also occur at the hands of Chinese police -- for example, the beating death of a newspaper editor that was reported in an article in the New York Times a few years ago.These reports are somewhat rare -- not because the behavior is rare, but because it is very difficult for journalists to do the sort of investigating and reporting that would be needed in order to uncover these outrages.  (Remember Amartya Sen's theory that a free press in India is the best explanation of the absence of famine since Independence; think how different China's political scene would be with a practice of unfettered investigative journalism.)But what these reports suggest is a very sober reality: that under current conditions in China, ordinary groups of Chinese people are subject to the imposition of serious violence if they come together to press their claims.  There are reports of violence by paid thugs concerning migrant workers, factory workers, peasants subject to land confiscation, and ordinary poor people who have somehow gotten into conflict with the authorities.What this also suggests is that the forging of an effective and binding legal order in China -- one that clearly articulates and defends the civil and individual rights of citizens that are valid even in circumstances of conflict between the powerful and the powerless -- creation of this legal order is a profoundly important goal for Chinese society.  Only on the basis of these kinds of legal guarantees can civil society be an arena in which citizens and groups can advocate for their interests in a peaceful and progressive manner."}, {"title": "Innovative social science research", "date": "Thursday, January 31, 2008", "text": "What are some ways in which the community of social science researchers can arrive at useful innovations in theory and method in order to do a better job of understanding society?

David is professor of sociology at Michigan and the founding director of the Center for Research and Solutions for Society (CARSS).  David has been a national leader in the development of the social sciences as a previous president of the Social Science Research Council and as a former director of Michigan's Institute for Social Research.  CARSS is a genuinely original collaborative effort at stimulating new thinking in the social sciences, and the interview gives a good exposure to some of the thinking that gave rise to the center.  (The interview is posted on YouTube and iTunes.)  The goal of CARSS is to serve as an incubation place for collaborative research aimed at contributing to solutions to some large social problems -- for example, more effective K-12 education, sustainable transportation systems, and responses to pandemic diseases. In each case there is a prominent role that is played by complex human behavior in the unfolding of the issue, and the solutions that policy makers attempt to design need to be well informed by the best thinking about how behavior is motivated and influenced.Two threads in the conversation were particularly significant for me.  First was David's emphasis that CARSS projects are interdisciplinary and usually involve practitioners as well as academic scientists.  We discussed the forms of knowledge that experienced practitioners bring to a discussion of a complex social problem -- in the genre of expert local knowledge -- and some of the intellectual challenges involved in trying to integrate theoretical and local knowledge into a solution.  And we talked about the challenges associated with bringing widely separated forms of academic research into a single conversation -- engineers, lawyers, and sociologists attempting to understand the transportation systems of the future, for example.A second important thread was the idea of engagement of the social sciences with social issues and problems.  This was very much the case with the Chicago school of sociology in the 1920s through 1940s.  But David makes the point early in the conversation that the social sciences made a turn in the 1960s towards greater disciplinary narrowness and a sharper separation between theory and practice.  The social sciences became more narrowly confined to the academy and its disciplinary institutions.But David and I agreed that two things were true: that the sciences ought to be shaping their disciplines and research programs with an eye to helping to solve some of society's problems -- for the good of society; but more deeply, that perhaps the quality of the science itself would increase as a result of this engagement.  These are important ideas that we need to talk about as we consider the directions the social sciences should take in the coming decades."}, {"title": "What is global about globalization?", "date": "Sunday, January 27, 2008", "text": "Of course we live in a globalizing world. But what does that really mean?One point that might be made emphasizes the local and the regional rather than the global. This is the observation that every part of the world is undergoing its own process of social change in a distinctive way. China, Brazil, and Nigeria are experiencing very different processes of economic growth and change. Mexico, Kenya, and Sri Lanka are coping with different forms of insurgency and ethnic conflict. India, Spain, and Guatemala witness very different social processes affecting peasants and rural society. So we might say that the whole world is changing -- but with different processes and dynamics everywhere.  On this line of thought, the global world is really just a patchwork of the many peoples, regions, and processes that are found in various countries.What is genuinely global is the working of a handful of large social processes of change that have effects in virtually every part of the globe. These mechanisms serve to convey causation rapidly throughout the globe -- sometimes with integrative effects and sometimes with the effect of creating new sources of conflict.  International trade and investment, and the international institutions that support these, are the most obvious such processes. But the cultural interconnections that are facilitated by new technologies of communication, transportation, and entertainment represent another factor with global influence. The fact that people in virtually every country on the planet can interact in the blogosphere is one manifestation of the global reach of the internet. The fact that missionaries, revolutionaries, and executives can travel easily from Los Angeles to Seoul and La Paz is a token of the rapid transmission and diffusion of ideas. And the transmission of the carriers of violence and aggression is likewise a global phenomenon -- from Pakistan to London and from Washington to Baghdad. And the websites that serve as the nucleus of extremist groups demonstrate the global reach of small groups of violent activists. Another source of global integration is the seriousness of the problems the world faces as a whole: climate change, new epidemic diseases, financial system insecurity, social violence, and warfare.  Global warming and avian flu pandemic will plainly demonstrate interdependence -- even as these disasters will predictably have very different consequences in different parts of the world.So there are real strands of social connection that justify us in saying the world is becoming more global.  But still we might say that the language of globalization is sometimes overdone. It is true that there are significant international forces that operate to bring the peoples of the world into closer contact and interdependency. But it is also true that cultures, societies, and peoples are historically situated and particular. And if we are to understand these particular processes, we need to consider the particular social fabric in which they unfold.If any collective entity possesses power, surely it is the state in a dictatorship \u2013 the Burmese military dictatorship or the single-party states of Cuba or China. So how does an authoritarian state exercise power?It is common to equate power with the ability to coerce and threaten in order to compel behavior. And certainly force and repression play a crucial role in authoritarian politics.  But even within a dictatorship the instruments of coercion are less than total.  When the priests and young people of Burma went into the streets of Rangoon a few months ago, the military rulers were able to use a mix of violence and restraint that permitted them to prevail against a budding democracy movement in Burma.  But in the past twenty years rulers in the Philippines, Czechoslovakia, and Tbilisi have found that their arsenal of water cannons, secret police, and truncheons have not sufficed to silence the streets.  Plainly, then, control of the forces of repression is an important component of the power base of an authoritarian dictatorship; but its scope is not unlimited.As was true in other postings about power, we have to begin by asking about the relational situation of the relevant actors.  What is the will of the state? What is the scope of behavior that the state wishes to control? Who are the agents who are subjects to the state's power?  We might put the geometry of state power into a simple diagram: goals and priorities => levers of influence (repression, persuasion, bribery, cooptation, horse trading) => varied actors (civil servants, military officers, community leaders, bandits, citizens) => behavior. From the dictator\u2019s point of view, there are two sets of actors over whom power needs to be exerted: intra-state actors \u2013 persons charged within the government to carry out the dictator\u2019s will; and actors in civil society \u2013 the citizens and organizations that make up mass society.  Intuitively, the power of a state is measured by its ability to constrain the behavior of a set of actors in ways that permit it to achieve its goals.Let\u2019s look first at the intra-state actors.  A state is a bureaucratic entity with decision-makers at a range of levels. Ministries and organs of the state -- the police and military for example -- have their own sources of power and domains of influence that are not fully within the control of higher authority. So the highest authority -- president or general \u2013 has only a limited ability to directly impose his will upon lower levels. In the extreme case the executive can discipline or remove the lower-level director. But this lever is imprecise; it leaves the agency director a certain amount of undetectable freedom of action. So we can readily envision the situation where the executive has announced a certain priority for his government, and where two important ministries come into conflict over what to do. And one or both may be motivated by local interests rather than the priorities of the state.  (This seems to be an important clue in explaining some current developments in China.  Central policies enacted in Beijing are ignored or reconsidered in regional government offices.)  In this instance we need to ask, what levers of power and influence does the executive have within the government itself through which it can compel compliance by both agencies?At this level we find the familiar processes of cooptation, alliance, inducement -- as well as threat -- found in all organizations. Perhaps a singular difference is that the use of violence is closer to the surface in dictatorship than in other political organizations. But the task facing the fascist dictator has much in common with that of the executive of other large organizations with multiple agendas.  The 20th century confronts us with some extreme cases -- Stalin's terrorism extended within his government as well as towards Soviet society at large, and Stalin used purges and executions to compel bureaucratic compliance. But it is an important question in organizational studies to assess the degree to which force and violence can effectively run a complex organization. And it seems likely that more ordinary mechanisms of persuasion and cooperation must usually be invoked.So much for the problem of exercising power within the state. Now consider the larger and more interesting question of power used against civil society and ordinary citizens. The issue of power arises only when the state wants a certain kind of behavior and citizens don\u2019t want to behave in this way.  Take the large issues over which states want to exercise their will over citizens: taxation, conscription, and delivery of agricultural products. There is, first, the use of the threat of punishment to compel conformance. Draft dodgers can be hunted down and punished, villages can be threatened with violent retaliation if villagers avoid taxes, and food can be withheld from non-compliant regions (for example, Stalin's war on the kulaks; see Lynne Viola, ed. The War Against the Peasantry, 1927-1930: The Tragedy of the Soviet Countryside). Moreover, if the state can establish a pervasive network of police and informants, it can make its threats credible -- with the result that compliance with law and dictum is reasonably high.  So the organs of repression are certainly an important element of power for the authoritarian state.Beyond violence, beyond effective enforcement, what other levers of behavior modification exist for the state? Two come to mind immediately: propaganda and the market. States often have a substantial degree of control over the instruments of thought formation -- schooling, media, and communications technology. And experience has made it clear that there is a substantial degree to which a population's behavior can be altered through these tools. Markets and other impersonal social mechanisms are another important mechanism for shaping behavior. China's one-child policy was successful in altering the reproductive behavior of hundreds of millions of Chinese people. And these policies turned on a combination of coercion, enforcement, and financial incentives.So perhaps the question of how authoritarian states exercise power is somewhat straightforward to answer: through organized repression, through artful command of a bureaucracy capable of acting cohesively, through the development of alliances with actors inside and outside of government, through cooptation of some actors to the disadvantage of other actors, through management of large social structures such as the market, and through the ability to set the terms of political behavior through the media and schooling."}, {"title": "Social science history and historical social science", "date": "Saturday, January 26, 2008", "text": "I talked recently with Tom Sugrue about his approach to historical research, and he had quite a few interesting things to say.  (Tom is professor of history and sociology at the University of Pennsylvania and author of The Origins of the Urban Crisis: Race and Inequality in Postwar Detroit. The interview is posted on YouTube.)  One topic we discussed was the relationship between historical research and social science research -- especially those areas of social science research that take history seriously.  Tom's central observation is that historians pay very close attention to the empirical and historical data that they work with -- the surprises and gritty texture that will be encountered in the archives.  But historians sometimes lose track of the larger questions that ought to give focus to their work.  This is where historical social science can be helpful; the social scientists are interested in large questions such as power, class, race, or economic structure.  But the social scientists have their own symmetrical weakness -- they often give too little attention to the empirical details of the cases or events they include in their analysis.  So Tom seems to be saying that history and social science can both contribute most strongly when the macro-disciplines work together, bringing theoretical vision and factual specificity into play.This contrast has come up quite a bit in the past twenty-five years.  Barrington Moore and Theda Skocpol offered social science theories of the causes of large political upheavals such as dictatorship and revolution.  Moore's Social Origins of Dictatorship and Democracy: Lord and Peasant in the Making of the Modern World was pathbreaking in the way it defined the intellectual challenge of explaining fascism and dictatorship.  In Skocpol's important book States and Social Revolutions: A Comparative Analysis of France, Russia and China she offered a comparative treatment of the Russian, French, and Chinese Revolutions, in an effort to tease out the social causes that brought about successful revolutions in these cases.  This is an important and compelling question for social scientists, and Skocpol's analysis has been highly influential.  But historians of each of those revolutions often complained that her treatment wasn't historical enough: it wasn't based on her own archival work, it was more abstract than a good history of the French Revolution would be, and it was offered as an effort to arrive a some causal generalizations -- rather than an account of this one specific messy historical complexity.  So there was a macro-disciplinary difference of perspective between the comparative historical sociologists (Moore, Skocpol, Goldstone) and the historians.I am inclined to think that the tension between the two disciplines is inherent and healthy; the historians and the comparative sociologists are trying to accomplish fairly different intellectual tasks.  The comparative sociologist is looking for some sort of causal or structural similarity across cases -- instances of dictatorship, revolution, or labor union -- and necessarily reduces the historical complexity of the cases to an analytical framework.  This means putting aside much of the messy complexity of the actual cases -- the particular strategies used by the Chinese Communist Party in a base area, the rhetoric of competition between the Parisian parties in 1790, the accidents of history that intruded into the particular cases.  The historian, on the other hand, is primarily interested in the particulars.  How did the struggle for civil rights for African-Americans proceed in this city in this time period?We might push the question a little bit deeper and ask, what resources can the social sciences offer working historians?  One part of the answer is conceptual: social scientists have framed a number of conceptual frameworks in terms of which to characterize and interrogate historical reality.  Marx's theory of class, Durkheim's theory of anomie, Tocqueville's highlighting of civic associations -- these are all instances of an effort by a social theorist to formulate a concept and a set of correlative theories in terms of which to analyze the historically given.  Second, social theorists devote much of their intellectual energy to discovering and analyzing common social mechanisms -- free-rider problems, class conflict, collective action, ethnic violence.  Historians can benefit by borrowing from each of these areas of knowledge.  And third, some people think that social scientists aim to discover laws or regularities that govern social phenomena.  If this were so, then the task of the historian would be very simple: go through the relevant social science literature, dredge up the pertinent laws, and explain the particular in terms of the workings of the laws.  Unfortunately, no such laws exist; there are no \"laws of motion\" of modern society.  So the historian's intuition -- that every historical event has its own individuality -- is born out.  At the same time, the social sciences can provide concepts and mechanisms on the basis of which the historian can do a better job of formulating and explaining the historical event of interest.As Tom Sugrue says in the interview, both these perspectives benefit from deep immersion in the findings and research efforts of the other.  But I'm inclined to think that they are not simply different ends of a spectrum.  Rather, they are different kinds of intellectual activity, and the criteria of success are different as well."}, {"title": "Was Alexis de Tocqueville a social scientist?", "date": "Thursday, January 24, 2008", "text": "Alexis de Tocqueville is sometimes counted among the founding influences in modern sociology -- one of the intellectual progenitors of the discipline in the 1830s-50s. \u00a0An aristocrat in post-revolutionary France, de Tocqueville played several roles \u00a0in his life: historian, politician, traveler, and social observer. \u00a0 My question here is a specific one: in what ways did Tocqueville's writings and thinking make an important contribution to sociology? \u00a0And is there anything in his writings that can serve as an important angle of view today as we consider new approaches to sociology?Tocqueville's relevance to sociology derives from at least three features of his thinking: his enormous interest in social observation -- in France, in Britain, in Algeria, and in America; his historical approach to understanding society -- the importance of placing contemporary changes into a historical context; and his causal and comparative imagination -- his desire to discover the causes of some of the patterns and differences he discerned in comparable societies. \u00a0I suppose that the books that brought him the greatest recognition reflect these three features of his intellectual persona. \u00a0Democracy in America\u00a0combines his appetite for discovering and describing the small but telling details of a society -- the features that mark it as an individual distinct from other contemporary societies, along with an interest in discovering the causes and effects of large features of the societies he observed. \u00a0This is an intriguing combination of the particular and the general, the small and the large in a modern society. \u00a0(This feature of his sociological imagination makes me think most of Simon Schama's historical writing -- for example, in Landscape And Memory.) \u00a0On the side of explanation, Tocqueville was interested in finding the ways in which environment, morality, and civic arrangements combined to produce distinctive patterns of behavior and modes of thought; these become large causal factors in his writings, to which he attributes some of the distinctive features of American values and behavior. And he singled out large features of American society for special study -- democracy, town and village life, the relations among the classes of society, the workings of education, and the workings of American market institutions.\u00a0The Ancien Regime and the Revolution\u00a0illustrates Tocqueville's historical imagination and his effort to place the largest event of the century -- the French Revolution -- into a context of moral and civic factors that combined to make the revolution inevitable. \u00a0\u00a0And other lesser books, such as his Recollections of 1848, reflect a combination of these interests in the particular details of a social event with an effort to provide a causal analysis of the way in which it unfolds -- the revolutionary upheavals in Paris in 1848. \u00a0(These are, of course, the same upheavals to which Marx referred in the Communist Manifesto as the \"spectre that is haunting Europe.\") \u00a0It is very interesting to contrast Tocqueville's first-hand observations of the June days of the revolution of 1848, including especially the bloodshed against the workers of Paris, with Marx's more theoretical writings about the same short period of time in The Civil War in France. \u00a0And it is interesting as well to note that Tocqueville was by no means a neutral observer of these events -- any more than Marx was. \u00a0Tocqueville was a partisan, supportive of the repression inflicted by the state in the name of order. \u00a0This too is of some interest when we consider Tocqueville's relation to the founding of sociology.But in the end, I think it is not a mistake to conclude that Tocqueville brought an important set of ideas to contemporary sociology -- the effort to create a scientific understanding of the modern world. \u00a0All of the features identified here -- a passion for close observation and description, an interest in the discovery of social causes, an imagination that proceeds through comparison and contrast, and a framework of thought that emphasizes the importance of history -- are in fact useful intellectual components for contemporary sociology. \u00a0Tocqueville's conservative view of the world certainly interacted with his observations and recommendations. \u00a0His was certainly not \"dispassionate\" or value-free social science. But at the same time, we might consider whether a Tocqueville in Shanghai today might not discover some pretty interesting details, processes, and mechanisms that could contribute a deeper sociology of China. \u00a0And the fact that Tocqueville's thinking did not proceed from the naturalism that motivated others of the founders -- Comte, Spencer, and Durkheim, for example -- is on the positive side of the balance sheet as well. \u00a0Tocqueville did not operate on the assumption that there must be a single underlying law that explains the processes that he observed in Manchester, Boston, or Algiers; instead, he was content to observe the diversity of the social phenomena he discovered and to tease out some possible, historically limited causal hypotheses about how these historically specific phenomena might work. \u00a0So as we reconsider the intellectual composition of the discipline of sociology, it is worthwhile reconsidering Tocqueville."}, {"title": "Social construction?", "date": "Sunday, January 20, 2008", "text": "It is common to say that various things are \"socially constructed\".   Gender and race are socially constructed, technology is socially  constructed, pain and illness are socially constructed. I am inclined  to think that these various statements are reasonable -- but that they  mean substantially different things and are true in very different  ways. So it is important to be more explicit about what we mean when  we refer to social construction.There is one broad distinction that is most fundamental in this  context -- the distinction between the construction that happens in  the formation of knowledge and that which occurs in the social process  involving self- and other-representing agents. The distinction is one  between the observer and the observed, and it is not absolute.  Participants are themselves knowledge producers, and what we will  recognize as their social construction involves their creation of schemes of representation. Nonetheless, there is an important line to  draw between the constructions of the observer and the participant.The crux of the issue is whether social reality is the creation of   the men and women who make it up, or whether the reality is shaped and  created by the conceptual lenses through which the observer frames the  social phenomena. As a social realist, I want to maintain the  separation between the social reality as constituted and experienced  by the actors and the conceptual schemes of the observer.  This position implies rejection of the epistemological version of  social constructivism, the view that the observer's concepts determine  social reality.There is a complication that needs to be addressed but that doesn't change the basic perspective of realism. This is the point that in  some unusual circumstances it is the case that scientific concepts and  theories feed back into behavior and thought of participants. The  definition of some mental illnesses is a good example, as is the form  of a variety of human institutions such as the factory or the prison:  concepts constructed by social theorists and critics feed back into  the design of the institution with the result that the next iteration  of the institution is indeed partially the construction if the  theorist. But these are exceptions, not the rule.So in what sense are gender, race, or technology instances of social construction from a realist perspective? It is a social reality that  societies embody identities for various groups of individuals and  these identities are framed by the thoughts, behavioral, and  strategies of people in society. Moreover, these thoughts and  behaviors change over time as a result of the contestation that occurs  around the identities. So the formulation of the identity of \"African-American professional,\" \"Jewish garment worker,\" or \"gay Texan\" is  ultimately the result of a process of contestation, repression, and  interactive social behavior. It is socially constructed through visible social processes and mechanisms.  And it is constructed, not by the external observer, but by the active and subjective participants.And what about technology? In what sense is the evolution of a technology like the bicycle or automobile socially constructed? (Of Bicycles, Bakelites, and Bulbs: Toward a Theory of Sociotechnical Change) What historians of technology usually mean by this assertion is a denial of the  idea that there is an inherent pathway of technology change that is implied by efficiency and the natural properties of materials and  designs. Against this inevitable-ism of function, historians note that the actual path of technology development is most commonly driven or  constrained by cultural preferences and expectations. Young men wanted an exciting adventure in their automobile in the 1910s -- and so the  boring electric car was doomed (Gijs Mom, The Electric Vehicle: Technology and Expectations in the Automobile Age). Weapons designers shared a culture of precision -- and so inertial navigation superceded radio-guided  systems (the predecessor of GPS) (Donald Mackenzie, Inventing Accuracy: A Historical Sociology of Nuclear Missile Guidance).  In other words -- technologies are socially constructed by the imperatives of culture in the surrounding  society.So there is a sense in which social constructivism is true and  informative -- and thoroughly consistent with social realism. And  there is another sense in which the phrase is extreme, philosophical,  and inconsistent with an empirical and realist study of social reality.(Ian Hacking has an interesting take on these issues in The Social Construction of What?.)This week I completed an interview and discussion with Mayer Zald in the department of sociology at the University of Michigan.  (The interview is part of an ongoing project of mine and is posted on my webpage and on YouTube.)  Mayer's career has been a long and productive one -- his first publication was over fifty years ago, and his ideas have shaped quite a bit of the discussion in the past several decades in the fields of social movements and the sociology of organizations.  Mayer did his Ph.D. in sociology at the University of Michigan in 1961, and has taught at Michigan and Vanderbilt during a long and distinguished career.  Mayer was very much influenced by some of the ideas and approaches of the Chicago school of sociology, and these influences persist in his thinking today.  As he puts it in the interview, \"I was trained as a social psychologist, and George Herbert Mead and Charles Horton Cooley were the founding fathers for American social psychology.\"Mayer surprised me at the beginning of the interview by defining social phenomena in terms of \"signifying\" and communicating -- rather than in terms of rationality, purposive behavior, and collective action.  Given how important collective action and social movements have been in Mayer's research, I had expected that strategic behavior and purposive choice would be the organizing concept, but it wasn't.  (He pointed out that rational choice theory doesn't have a lot of credibility in sociology, though there is a difference between the formalisms of rational choice theory and the more general concept of social action as guided by purposive, intentional agents.)Like all creative thinkers -- in the social sciences and in other fields as well -- Mayer continues to think freshly about the puzzles and processes that the social world confronts us with.  He continues to wonder whether there are new approaches that might be taken to shed more light on the sociological processes that we observe.  For example, Mayer has paid a lot of attention in the past several years to the question of how the methods and approaches of the humanities might be valuable in sociological research.Mayer also has a very reflective perception of the way in which sociology has developed over the past fifty years, and the ways in which the sub-disciplines have proliferated. And he has taken a fresh look at the question of what counts as \"progress\" or cumulativeness in the social sciences.What I find fascinating and valuable about doing these interviews is the insight that comes from talking with a smart, innovative and experienced researcher with a long view of the social science disciplines.  Somehow this level of discussion seems very different from reading the scholar's published work.  It is possible to probe into issues that don't necessarily come into central focus in the published work, and it is possible to watch the gifted scholar's mind at work.  And it is possible to get past the big headlines of the person's work and dig more deeply into the intellectual challenge of understanding society."}, {"title": "Alienation and anomie", "date": "Sunday, January 20, 2008", "text": "It is interesting to compare Durkheim and Marx on their ideas about  modern consciousness. Durkheim focused on social solidarity as one of  the important functions of a social order: individuals had a defined  place in the world that was created and reinforced by the social  values of morality, religion, and patriotism. He observed that these  strands of solidarity are stronger or weaker in different societies,  and he also observed that some modern social forces tend to break down  these moral strands of social cohesion -- the creation of large  cities, for example. In his theory of suicide, he highlights the  situation of \"anomie\" to refer to the circumstance of individuals  whose relationship to the social whole is weak, and he explains  differences in suicide rates across societies as the result of  different levels of solidarity and its opposite, anomie.Marx's concept of alienation involves a somewhat different kind of  separation and breakdown -- separation of the person from his/her  nature as a free producer and creator, and separation of the person  from his/her natural sociality. Marx thinks of affirming social  relations as founded on equality and freedom. So modern capitalist  society is destructive of true sociality.What is interesting in this comparison is that both Durkheim and Marx  appear to be diagnosing a similar feature of modernity. In Durkheim's  case there is an implicit contrast between a pre-modern world in which  individuals have a well-defined social and moral place and the  contemporary world in which these strands of solidarity are breaking  down. In Marx's case the contrast is forward-looking. Marx compares  the present -- the factory -- with the future -- a society of free,  equal, social producers. But in each case the theorist is grappling with an absence in modernity -- an absence of a social and moral  setting that gives the individual a basis for self-respect and  sociable collaboration with others. The social itself is breaking  down. (This is a theme with other social theorists as well; for  example, in T\u00f6nnies' distinction between Gemeinschaft and Gesellschaft. Peter Laslett's title The World We Have Lost, England Before the Industrial Age captures some  of the same idea.)Coming forward to the social theories of the late twentieth century,  these issues continue to fascinate some social observers. Robert  Putnam's work on trying to measure the changing density of civic  involvement (social capital) is a different perspective on Durkheim's  concept of solidarity. (Another great title -- Bowling Alone : The Collapse and Revival of American Community.)  Sociologists who focus on disaffected young people are raising similar  issues. And the New Left sociology and theory of workers' alienation  from society picks up where Marx left off on this issue.Is the time right for a new round of thinking about the nature of  social consciousness and social solidarity? Do we need some new  concepts of how ideas and identities contribute to a social whole? Is  the study and theorizing of social subjectivity an important aspect of  the challenge of sociology?"}, {"title": "Alienation and subjectivity", "date": "Saturday, January 19, 2008", "text": "Marx provided a rigorous basis for analyzing the facts about exploitation in a class society. This is on the materialistic side of the equation -- interests, resources, consumption. But he also provided what must be considered pathbreaking writing about workers' subjectivity -- their state of consciousness, their subjective frameworks for understanding the world they inhabit, and the ways in which their identities are forged. At a distance of one hundred seventy years, this effort at analysis of subjectivity seems remarkably current. It harmonizes with the cultural turn in some of the social sciences and with feminist theorizing about the lived experience of women. It suggests the value of empirical ethnographic work on the experience and mentality of workers. And it is unfinished business.What Marx had to say about the subject is mostly expressed in the Economic and Philosophic Manuscripts of 1844. The concept of alienation refers to separation from something important. In EPM Marx analyzes the structure of the production process in a factory in capitalism. And he finds that the nature of this process works to alienate the worker from the product (limited consumption), the labor process (because his/her labor is commanded rather than freely expressed), from one's social nature (because of factory work rules that prohibit talking and collaborating), and from \"species-being\" (the worker's essence as a free, social, self-directed creator). So the causes of worker alienation are to be found in the workings of coercive relations of production that deny the worker the opportunity for free creativity and self-expression.There are several other concepts in Marx's work that get some grip on subjectivity -- the fetishism of commodities, the idea of class consciousness, and the idea of ideology and ultimately false consciousness. These are all concepts through which Marx sought to explore the main features of worker subjectivity -- the ways in which ideas and mental frameworks structure one's experience of the world and the ways in which these mental structures are \"determined\" or influenced by social relations. And a central concern of Marx's was to understand the subjectivities underlying political consciousness and mobilization.There are two important points here. First, there is the formulation of an important intellectual task -- that of formulating a set of concepts that permit us to analyze and explore mentality or consciousness. And this body of research should also give us a basis for understanding political behavior. People's thoughts and assumptions influence their politicl behavior. Second, and more distinctive of Marx, is the formulation of an agenda of explanation, a sociology of consciousness. Marx wants to discover some of the ways that historical circumstances, economic structures, and social relations of production influence or determine these features of historically situated consciousness. He wants to know how it is that \"the hand mill gives you the feudal lord\".  The theory of ideology is one such effort -- a causal theory that says that the interests of powerful people shape the consciousness of the worker. But it is evident that this theory is just the beginning.Likewise, Marx offers a materialist theory of alienation. Social circumstances -- the social relations of production and the factory system -- produce a subjective effect -- the worker's alienation. And similarly with commodity fetishism, reification, and false consciousness.  These ideas moved forward in the twentieth century in the hands of Antonio Gramsci (in his concepts of hegemony and the intellectual) and in the thinking of theorists in the Critical Theory tradition (Horkheimer, Adorno, Wellmer).The reason I think it is worthwhile recalling this history in a few hundred words is that our goal is to -- understand society. This means finding the concepts necessary to probe objective social factors and causes. But equally it requires coming to grips with  subjectivity and its historical and social conditions. So finding the tools that will allow us to describe, analyze, and explain the fluid formations of mentality, identity, and consciousness is a leading challenge for a more satisfactory social science.  And Marx's early ideas about alienation and fetishism provide some good starting points."}, {"title": "Charting inequality", "date": "Tuesday, January 15, 2008", "text": "Inequality is a central and familiar topic for sociological research (as it is for social and political philosophy).

What do we want to know about social inequalities?Most evidently we can observe inequalities across individuals and groups with respect to the level of attainment of various important social goods: income, wealth, home ownership, health status, educational attainment, and employment, to name several. It is trivial to observe that there are differences across individuals with respect to these goods -- John has higher income and better health than Phil. What is less trivial is the discovery that members of a group, defined in terms of one or more socially significant properties, show differences with respect to these outcomes: inequalities of income between men and women, inequalities of incidence of diabetes across white and black adults, differences in educational attainment across rural, suburban, and urban residence, and so forth. Once we have identified inequalities like these across social groups, we want to have a causal explanation of the differences. What are the social processes through which these differences in outcome arise?A related kind of inequality is somewhat less tangible. It has to do with unobservable social properties like status, power, or privilege. We can't directly measure this person's total social power or that person's social status. But we can arrive at comparative judgments about the relative level of status and power for various individuals, and we can likewise make comparative judgments about these qualities as exhibited by various social groups. Once again the question of social causation arises: what are the social processes that give rise to different levels of power, status, or privilege for various social groups?In each instance we want to know what the social processes and mechanisms are that proliferate outcomes differentially across groups defined by such characteristics as race, gender, income status, etc.  What factors and processes cause the occurrence of inequalities with respect to a social good across social groups defined by a socially salient property (race, gender, age)?  If there is a measured difference with respect to the social property across two groups, there must be a causal factor that distinguishes the groups. A natural hypothesis is that human talents and personalities are randomly distributed across all human beings. On this assumption, we should expect that there will be no differences of outcome across social groups that are purely based on differences of talent, since by hypothesis there is no difference in the distribution of talents across randomly selected groups. So if there are observed differences in outcome, we need to find a social process that would explain the differences across groups. There must be a causal factor that explains the difference.We might say that there are only a few basic possibilities.  Members of the groups might possess personal characteristics differentially that causally produce the good.  This might be the result of filtering or differential recruitment into the group.  Second, the mechanisms assigning the good to individuals might discriminate on the basis of the property or a correlated property.  Third, membership in the group might give members differential access to resources or opportunities that are themselves productive of the good.So far we have formulated the problem as one of explaining inequalities across groups defined by some other feature.  But there is a separate issue about inequalities that sociologists address.  Suppose we notice that the \u201crich\u201d are gaining a higher percentage of income over time and the \u201cpoor\u201d a falling percentage. These two groups are defined with respect to the very property with which they are measurably unequal.  Formulated from this perspective, the question is this: what are the causal factors possessed by the group of \u201crich\u201d that accounts for their high income, and conversely for the \u201cpoor\u201d? Upon investigation we might find that the two groups are different in a variety of ways: amount of higher education, place of residence, race, age.  This might lead us to ask the question, are some of these factors causal with respect to income; are other factors collateral effects of high income; and are yet others simply the non-causal correlates of the truly causal factors?This suggests two angles of approach on the question of inequalities across groups.  One is to single out the two populations at opposite ends of a particular spectrum of difference and examine their various characteristics.  The other is to single out a socially salient property (race, for example) and investigate whether there are differences with respect to the social good (income).  The first cut raises the question, what factors distinguish the high-achieving and low-achieving groups that might explain the observed differences; the second asks, why is the property causally relevant to the distribution of the good?"}, {"title": "Coverage of the social sciences", "date": "Thursday, January 10, 2008", "text": "Suppose we took the view that the social sciences ought to provide sufficient conceptual and methodological tools to analyze and explain any kind of social behavior. This would be a certain kind of completeness: not theoretical or explanatory completeness, in the sense of having a finished set of theories that can explain everything, but conceptual completeness, in the sense that there are sufficient conceptual resources to give a basis for describing every form of social behavior, and methodological completeness, in the sense that for every possible research question there are starting point for inquiry in the social sciences. And, finally, suppose we stipulate that there are always new hypotheses to be discovered and new theories to be invented.If this is one of the ultimate aspirations for the social sciences, then we can ask -- how close is the current corpus of social science research and knowledge to this goal?One possible answer is that we have already reached this goal. The conceptual resources of anthropology, economics, political science, and sociology serve as a \"fish-scale\" system of conceptual coverage that gives us a vocabulary for describing any possible configuration of social behavior. And the most basic ideas about empirical research, causal reasoning, hypothetical thinking, and interpretation of meaning give us a preliminary basis for probing and investigating any of the \"new\" phenomena we might discover.Another possible answer goes in the opposite direction. The concepts of the social science disciplines are parochial and example-based. When new forms of social interaction emerge we will need new concepts on the basis of which to describe and represent these social behaviors.  So concepts and empirical knowledge must go hand in hand, and new discoveries will stimulate new concepts as well.Consider this thought experiment. Suppose the social sciences had developed to this point minus micro-economics. The reduced scheme would involve many aspects of behavior and thought, but it would have omitted the category of \"rational self-interest.\" Is this a possible scenario? Would the reduced set be complete in the sense described above? And what kind of discovery would be required in order for these alternative-world social scientists to progress?The incompleteness of alternative-world social science is fairly evident. There would be important ranges of behavior that would be inscrutable without the concept of rational self-interest (market equilibria, free-rider problems). And the solution would appear fairly evident as well. These gaps in explanatory scope would lead investigators to ask, what is the hidden factor we are  not considering? And they would be led to discover the concept of rational self-interest.The moral seems to be this: it is always possible that new discoveries of anomalous phenomena will demonstrate the insufficiency of the current conceptual scheme.  And therefore there is never a point at which we can declare that science is now complete, and no new concepts will be needed.At the same time, we do in fact have a rough-and-ready pragmatic confidence that the social sciences as an extended body of theories, concepts, and results have pretty well covered the primary scope of human behavior. And this suggests a vision of the way the social sciences cover the domain of the social as well: not as a comprehensive deductive theory but rather as an irregular, overlapping collection of concepts, methods, and theories -- a set of fish-scales rather than an architect's blueprint for all social phenomena."}, {"title": "Is there such a thing as capitalism?", "date": "Tuesday, January 8, 2008", "text": "Marx's central theoretical concept is \"capitalism.\"  He wanted to provide a theory of the capitalist mode of production; he wanted to discover the laws of motion of the capitalist mode of production; and he believed that there was a compact structural identity that is shared by capitalist economies.  Later Marxist economists refined the concept somewhat by distinguishing among various stages of capitalist development, with thinkers such as Ernest Mandel and Paul Sweezy focusing on \"late capitalism\".My question here is a simple one. From the point of view of social ontology and concept formation in sociology -- does it make sense to think of capitalism as a single thing with multiple instances across time and space? Is there a reason to think that \"England, 1880,\" \"Germany, 1910,\" \"Japan, 1960,\" \"United States, 1980,\" and \"France, 2000\" are all instances of a single economic system?Consider briefly Marx's account of the core features of capitalism.  It is an economic system based on a particular and distinctive property system: private property in the means of production (capital) and private ownership of labor by the worker (labor).  The worker is free to sell his/her labor power to multiple owners of capital; but, having been separated from all other forms of access to means of production, the worker is not free to withhold his/her labor altogether.  So the worker is dependent on the capitalist for access to the means of subsistence; and the capitalist is dependent upon the worker as the creator of surplus value.  It is a system that is premised on surplus extraction by owners of capital from the producers of value (workers).  It is a system based on accumulation: constant growth and expansion of the appropriation of surplus value (profits).  And it is a system based on accumulation rather than consumption.  And, finally, Marx believes that these social institutions create an institutional logic for capitalist economies that is different from other modes of production -- a tendency towards technological innovation, a tendency towards a falling rate of profit, the creation of an \"industrial reserve army,\" and the creation of a tendency towards economic crisis. It is this claim that permits Marx to assert that he has produced a theory that encompasses a whole class of social formations, rather than being simply a description based on a single case, British capitalism of mid-nineteenth century.In order to carry this concept through, we would need to postulate that there is a core set of economic features and institutions that constitute the \"essence\" of capitalism; that these core features recur across multiple historical social formations; and that the differences that exist across historical cases are non-essential, accidental, epiphenomenal, or super-structural.And differences there are, of course.  One important dimension of difference is the degree and nature of state involvement in the economy.  But other differences are equally important: the subtle but distinctive differences in property systems that exist in England, Germany, Japan, or the United States; the differences that exist in regulatory regimes (such as those documented by Frank Dobbin); the cultural differences that exist across \"capitalist\" societies with respect to attitudes towards wealth, the environment, or inequalities; and so on for a continuing and broad range of differences across societies.Given this fact of sociologically important differences across historical instances of capitalism, we appear to have two theoretical choices.  The first is to postulate that the common, core institutions of capitalist societies impose a logic of development on capitalist societies that is more fundamental than any of the evident differences across instances.  The other is to judge that the concept of capitalism is simply a nominal social category, grouping together a number of societies which have some similarities and also important differences.  Or, following Weber, we might say that capitalism is an ideal type, an organizing and idealized concept that singles out a set of features that often hang together, but recognizing that no particular society perfectly exemplifies all these features.It seems to me that Marx fell into a fetishim of his own in reifying the capitalist mode of production as a general historical category.  We are better off following the lead of the new institutionalists, recognizing that every society has a somewhat different configuration of basic institutions; and acknowledging that these differences make a difference in the development and historical trajectory of these societies.  There are important commonalities across many or most of the societies that Marx would call \"capitalist\" -- a deep conflict of interest between capital and labor, a likelihood that economic property ownership will support political power and influence, and other common features.  But to judge that \"every capitalist society develops in the same way\" goes well beyond what history or theory would support.  Instead, we need to have specific, factual analysis of each of the societies we are interested in, and should highlight the differences that exist as well as the commonalities that recur.  This finding takes us further down the road of emphasizing particularity and difference as much as generalization and regularity in social science theorizing."}, {"title": "Collective behavior and resource mobilization theory", "date": "Monday, January 7, 2008", "text": "The study of collective behavior and social movements has been a central sub-discipline of sociology since the 1970s. This is understandable for several reasons -- first, because collective behavior is inherently an important sociological process, and second, because the 1960s and 1970s witnessed particularly significant social movements in the US and other parts of the world. The US civil rights movement, the Vietnam anti-war movement, Czechoslovakia and France in 1968, and a variety of anti-colonial struggles in Asia, Latin America, and Africa made social movements particularly salient for sociologists in the 70s and 80s.There are several different kinds of research questions that can be posed about social movements. One line of inquiry is descriptive and ethnographic. Researchers could immerse themselves in the concrete details of specific examples of social movements, discovering some of the specific characteristics and processes that were to be found in specific examples. Moreover, researcher could recognize the importance of failure and provide a similar level of description and narrative for failed social movements as well. This kind of descriptive research is very important in the study of any complex social phenomenon.Second, given the interest that sociologists have in the explanation of social processes, it would be natural for sociologists to attempt to discover the causes of successful social mobilization. Comparative sociologists might approach this task by trying to discover some macro-social factors that would appear to distinguish successful from unsuccessful mobilizations. In other words, they might isolate a handful of examples of successful and unsuccessful social movements, and then use sociological theory and imagination to identify a set of macro-factors that might be thought to be conducive to (or inhibiting of) successful social mobilization.  This strategy suggests use of Mill's methods to sort out necessary and/or sufficient conditions for the outcome.  And it would issue in pronouncements like \"successful social movements require X, Y, and Z as necessary conditions.\"A third possible approach combines some features of both of these. This third approach acknowledges that each social event embodies a great deal of particularity and contingency -- thus requiring a substantial amount of descriptive research. But this third approach also postulates that there are causes of successful and unsuccessful mobilization and that these take the form of concrete social-causal mechanisms. So this approach directs the researcher to engage in concrete research with the goal of discovering some of the concrete social mechanisms that appear to have been critical. This research in turn has some promise in providing the basis for some limited generalizations in the study of social movements. If we find that there are some common challenges that efforts at social mobilization confront, this is a beginning of a more general treatment. And if we find that there are a handful of key mechanisms that recur in many cases, this further supports the development of more generalized statements about mobilization. (This is roughly the approach that McAdam, Tarrow and Tilly take in Dynamics of Contention.)Now let's return to the role that resource mobilization theory plays in the study of social movements. This concept is said to be one of the primary theories of social movements. Its primary competitor on the 1980s was \"political process theory.\" My question here is a simple one: in what sense do either of these concepts function as theories of social movements? If they are intended to serve as nouns in sentences like these -- \"Social movements always occur in circumstances where there is more X in the social context\" -- then I want to say that neither concept is likely to serve well and neither really functions as a theory of collective behavior. This usage is attempting to fulfill the second project above, namely, offering an account of the necessary and sufficient conditions of mobilization.  However, given the contingency and heterogeneity of social events, it is unlikely that there are any such conditions.  But the situation is much better if we take the view that both \"resource mobilization\" and \"political process\" theories serve to describe social mechanisms that are found in many different instances of social movements -- though often in different forms and levels of importance.  On this approach, \"resource mobilization\" is a theory of a social process or circumstance that is a relevant causal mechanism in many different instances of social movements.  But it does not function as a general theory of social movements; instead, it is a developed description of a social mechanism that can be recognized in a variety of contexts (not all of which involve social movements).In other areas of science a theory of a domain is thought to be a compact set of hypotheses that explain all the phenomena of the domain.  \"Resource mobilization\" and \"political process\" cannot function in this way.  However, each of these concepts can function as a description of a limited but real social mechanism; and in this way they each can play a constructive role in explaining important instances of collective mobilization and social movements.Rational choice theory could be advanced as a pure set of axioms embodying a formal representation of individual choice under circumstances of uncertainty and strategic interaction. Decision theory incorporates the idea of maximizing utility under circumstances of uncertainty and risk. The basic rule is that the decision-maker could collect information about the utility and probability of each feasible choice, and choose the option that affords the maximum expected utility. (Here the decision-maker is playing against nature.) Game theory expands the range of decision-making situations by giving a representation of strategic interaction: situations in which the actor's outcome depends upon the choices or strategies made by one or more rational opponents. Mathematical game theorists have demonstrated that this problem too admits of rational solution. The actor needs to discover the choices available to him/her and each other player and he/she needs to assign utilities for each possible outcome for each player.  It is then demonstrable, for both zero-sum and non-zero-sum games, that there are one or more equilibrium sets of strategies for each player. This means that there is a single strategy or a mixed set of strategies with the property that, given rational choices by the opponent, there is no other strategy available to self that would produce a higher utility for self. (It may be observed that for games with many strategies for each player, discovery of the equilibrium set may not be practical.) Certain two-person games have received a great deal of analysis, including the prisoners' dilemma, the game of chicken, and a range of cooperative games.So much for the formal theory. In what sense does rational choice theory or game theory provide a basis for an explanation of real social outcomes?We might begin a response to this question by saying that the axioms have empirical content as descriptions of real human decision-making. Real decision-makers do consider alternative choices in terms of the value and probability of the outcome. Moreover, actors who systematically break the expected utility rule will do less well than those who act according to the rule. So non-expected-utility actors will either learn or disappepear if the stakes are high. Likewise, in strategic situations (those depending on the independent actions of other deliberative agents), actors try to choose their strategy based on an analysis of the future choices of other players. So, once again, rational choice theory appears to capture an important dimension of real human decision making.As noted in a prior posting, it goes without saying that human reasoners are not entirely conformant to the axioms -- norms intervene, computational limits interfere, and the assesment of risky situations appears to be systematically divergent from the expected-utility model. In fact, these deviations create the subject matter for experimental or behavioral economics.  (Daniel Kahneman and Amos Tversky, Judgment under Uncertainty: Heuristics and Biases.)But given that there is some degree of correspondence between RC axioms and real human reasoning, we might say that RC theory provides an empirically grounded way of modeling certain real situations of decision making and strategic interaction. The pressing question is whether the empirical failures of the axioms as a description of real actors are sufficient to thoroughly invalidate the models.  And it would appear that there are specific social settings that are likely to represent something like the pure case of rational decision-making as hypothesized by RC theory.This implies in turn that there is a realistic basis for treating RC theory as a possible source of real empirically grounded explananations of observed social behavior. For example, suppose we are interested in the distributive features of WTO treaties or the incidence of peasant rebellions in late imperial China. We might model the WTO problem by treating nations as rational actors, attributing a set of utilities and probabilities to them, and using the findings of bargaining theory to predict the nature of the distribution of benefits and burdens in a series of agreements. Or we might regard the occurrence of a rebellion as a choice situation for each potential rebel that involves multiple outcomes, each with a utility and a probability. And we might hypothesize that rebellions will be most frequent in situations where the costs of participation are lowest and the rewards are greatest (James Tong, Disorder Under Heaven: Collective Violence in the Ming Dynasty).In each case we have taken an abstract mathematical system, used it to create a model of the actual social situation of interest, and have then solved the terms of the model. This solution can then be interpreted as a prediction or post-diction of the actual situation, and we can compare the model's results with empirical and hisistorical facts.(A very negative assessment of the empirical utility of rational choice theory is offered in Donald Green and Ian Shapiro, Pathologies of Rational Choice Theory: A Critique of Applications in Political Science.  Their skepticism is taken on by many authors in Jeffrey Friedman's edited volume, The Rational Choice Controversy: Economic Models of Politics Reconsidered.)"}, {"title": "How can race be a cause of something like asthma?", "date": "Friday, January 4, 2008", "text": "Though I've posed this posting around the question of \"race and asthma,\" the question here isn't really about public health. It is rather concerned with the general question, how can a group characteristic be a causal factor in enhancing some other group characteristic?Suppose the facts are these: that African-Americans have a higher probability of developing asthma, even controlling for income levels, education levels, age, and urban-suburban residence. (I don't know if the facts support this statement, but it is the logic that I am concerned with here.) And suppose that the researcher summarizes his/her findings by saying that \"being African-American causes the individual to have a higher risk of developing asthma.\"  How are we supposed to interpret this claim?My preferred interpretation of statements like these is to hypothesize a causal mechanism, presently unknown, that influences African-American people differentially and produces a higher incidence of asthma. Here are a few possibilities:(a) African-Americans as a population have a lower level of access to quality healthcare and are more likely to be uninsured. Asthma is a disease that is best treated on the basis of early diagnosis. Therefore African--Americans are more likely to suffer from undiagnosed and worsening asthma. This hypothesis is inconsistent with the assumed facts, however, in that the assertion is that the pattern persists even when we control for income. (b) Asthma is an inner-city disease. It is stimulated by air pollution. African-Americans are more likely to live in inner-city environments because of the workings of residential segregation. So race causes exposure which in turn causes a higher incidence of the disease. (Again, this hypothesis is inconsistent with the stated facts that stipulate having controlled for residence.) (c) There might be an unidentified gene that is more frequent in people with African ancestry than non-African ancestry and that makes one more susceptible to asthma. If this were correct, then we would expect the discrepancy to disappear if we control for frequency of this gene. Groups of white and black people randomly selected but balanced so that the frequency of the gene is the same in both groups should show the same incidence of asthma.  (d) It could be that there is a nutritional component to the onset of asthma, and it could be that cultural differences between the two communities lead the African-American population to have higher levels of exposure to the nutritional cause of the disease.  And of course we could proliferate possible mechanisms.In each case the logic of the account is similar. We proceed by hypothesizing a factor or combination of factors that increase the likelihood of developing asthma; and then we try to determine whether this collalateral factor is more common in the African-American community. Some of these stories would amount to spurious correlations, while others would constitute stories in which the fact of race (as opposed to a factor with which race is accidentally correlated) plays an essential role in the causal story. (Reduced access to healthcare and inner city air pollution fall in this category, since it is institutional race segregation that causes the higher-than-normal frequency of urban residence for African-Americans.)So this is a potential interpretation of the causal meaning of a statement like \"race causes an increased risk of X.\" But is this now a fact about individuals or groups? Do the causal interpretations here disaggregate from group to individual? Does \"higher incidence in the population\" disaggregate onto statements about the factors that influence the individual's separate risk?  It appears that this causal mechanism interpretation does in fact disaggregate to the individual level, since each describes a factor that pertains to the individual and that directly influences his/her likelihood of developing the disease.What would be most perplexing is if there were multiple sets of causal mechanisms, each independent of the others and each creating a race-specific difference in incidence of the disease. For example, it might be that both exposure to air pollution and lack of health insurance lead to a higher incidence of the disease; and further, it might be that inner-city residents do in fact have adequate healthcare but exposure to inner-city pollution; while suburban African-Americans might have less healthcare and limited exposure to air pollution. In this set of facts, both African-American populations would display higher-than-normal incidence, but for different and unrelated reasons."}, {"title": "Biography and personality psychology", "date": "Thursday, January 3, 2008", "text": "Think about the relationship between researching a biography of a complex individual and compiling a set of theories about personality development.  The individual, Mr. X, is a particular person whose life and personality took shape through a long series of contingent happenings.  The biographer's task is to arrive at some insights into Mr. X's motivations and desires; his features of character (courage, magnanimity); his weaknesses; as well as providing an illuminating account of some of the shaping events and choices that Mr. X made along the way. Mr. X's actions and choices are comprehensible -- but in order to understand them we need to know what he thought, wanted, intended, resisted, and chose, and why.  In other words, we need a fairly detailed profile of Mr. X's personality, preferences, and vanities.  We need to know Mr. X as a particular and unique person.Now it is worth commenting that this biographical description is itself a generalization.  When we write that \"Mr. X was concerned about how his actions were perceived, and often acted out of a desire to put his actions in a good light\" -- we are making a generalization across Mr. X's lifetime of choices.  And we are also hypothesizing something not directly observable -- a persistent feature of Mr. X's subjective world of choosing, his self-consciousness.  In the course of the biography we might make statements such as \"Mr. X chose to stay in his job at the New York Times because it was very prestigious; whereas Ms. Y was more adventurous in her career and moved to Slate.com.\"  This comparison implies that both X and Y have persistent traits of personality -- traits that led them to make different choices under similar circumstances.So a biography is a compilation of several different kinds of assertions or observations: some of the things that happened to the subject, some of the actions and choices the subject made, some hypotheses about the subject's personality and motivational system, and an interpretation of the causes and reasons of some of these choices.  The biography asserts a degree of consistency over time -- Mr. X can be counted on to behave similarly in circumstances that raise the same intra-personal issues -- even as it documents the particularity and uniqueness of Mr. X in contrast to other persons in similar circumstances.  So a biography combines particularity and a certain kind of generality.Now consider a textbook in personality psychology.  The textbook too is interested in explaining why people behave as they do.  But it approaches the problem from the point of view of taxonomy, causal analysis, and generalized explanations.  The taxonomy part comes in through the effort to describe a handful of personality \"types\" -- individuals sharing a cluster of personality characteristics that make them similar in action to each other and different from others.  The causal analysis comes in through the door of a set of hypotheses about what constitutes a personality; how features of personality are embodied in the individual; how they are cultivated or shaped through development; and how they manifest in patterns of action.  And the generalized explanations enter in the form of statements about groups of people sharing common personality features: \"Ethnic massacres often occur as a result of manipulation of group emotions through the media.\"  The task of the theories of personality psychology is to provide a basis for explaining behavior; but unlike biography, personality psychology singles out the common features of personality that are found in a whole group of actors.Now, if the classification exercise could be done in a really successful way -- so that we conclude that there are personality types A, B, and C, and here are the behavioral dispositions of the three types -- then biography would be unnecessary.  All we need to know is whether Mr. X is an A, a B, or a C.  In fact, however, we know that people are more varied than this.  At best the small handful of personality types associated with personality theory can be construed as ideal types, pure versions of the various hypotheses; but we will also understand that very few people exactly embody exactly one of these ideal types.  Instead, people's motivations and personalities are a blend of numerous currents; and the role of biography is to identify these particular confluences in the subject of interest.This is an interesting contrast for the social sciences, because there is a parallel distinction in the description and analysis of social particulars.  Sometimes social scientists are primarily interested in stripping the \"individuals\" they consider (wars, revolutions, cities) down to a small list of characteristics about which they attempt to arrive at generalizations.  And sometimes they are interested in treating the \"individual\" as a complex particular with its own life history and personality.  The urban geographer may want to consider all United States cities with more than 500,000 inhabitants as a group, and then to arrive at some hypotheses and generalizations about this set of cities.  This is analogous to the personality psychology  of the distinction.  Or the urban geographer may want to focus in on the particular identity and persona of one city -- Chicago -- and treat it as a biographer might treat Franklin D. Roosevelt.  Both approaches are legitimate.  The second, however, is perhaps undervalued in the social sciences because of its particularity.  As discussed in the previous posting, however, there are good reasons for thinking that understanding the richness of empirical detail of a city like Chicago is itself a worthwhile sociological task.Descriptive research and writing in the social sciences is generally looked at with a degree of condescension.  The complaint is that science should be explanatory, and descriptive work is both shallow and trivial. We can almost hear the doctoral supervisor responding to the candidate who has spent a year in primary research in the field and in tax offices in Indonesia, producing a finely detailed descriptive study of how the fiscal institutions actually work across levels and regions: \"That's well and good, but what do you make of your findings?  What patterns have you discovered? Why do the variations you've documented occur as they do? Where's your theory?\"The \"shallow and trivial\" criticism is unfounded and unjust. Our talented field researcher will have found an enormous and surprising range of variation among the institutions and practices he has studied. And these variations cannot be inferred from some general theory of fiscal institutions. They must be discovered and documented on the ground. Further, we can't come up with any useful theory of institutions in the absence of some rigorous, concrete, and particular descriptions of a variety of institutions.  We need the complexity and texture of good, rigorous description to help produce genuinely explanatory theories.  (Robert Klitgaard's treatment of corruption fits this description nicely; Controlling Corruption.)So detailed descriptive research is important -- because the social world is unruly and varied, and there is no single rule or law that generates this diversity; and it is difficult, in that it requires extensive and disciplined efforts at observation and discovery. Moreover, descriptive research is theoretical in one important respect: deciding upon the features of the phenomena that are worth recording is itself the result of preliminary hunches about what is salient or significant. (Of course there is no such thing as pure description.)At the same time, the critic is right in one important respect: having documented variation in practices and local implementation of the basic fiscal institutions, it is quite reasonable to expect the researcher to try to find some explanations of this variation. Our graduate student now needs to reconsider the manuscript and try to determine whether any of the variation and particularity makes sense from the point of view of known social mechanisms. Why did the Indonesian fiscal system evolve into the variegated structure it now consists of? And this is where social theory is most useful -- not as a grand explanatory scheme, but as many small bits of theory capturing some relevant features of behavior and institution-building in these particular circumstances.  So, for example, our graduate student may notice that principal-agent problems are endemic in fiscal institutions. Given that taxes are being assessed and paid, all the participants have some motivation to subvert the process. So it may be that some observed variants can be explained as strategic efforts to solve principal-agent problems. Or as another example -- limited and unreliable forms of communication may exist in some parts of the country under study, and features of the fiscal system in these under-served regions may have been selected because they are less reliant on swift, accurate communication.Maybe this gives a basis for assessing the role of descriptive inquiry in the social sciences.Because social phenomena are heterogeneous and plastic, there is an important and enduring role for careful descriptive inquiry. The task of discovering and documenting the variety and diversity of social phenomena is both important and intellectually challenging.  Because social phenomena emerge from purposive human agency, there are an open-ended number of social mechanisms that are potentially relevant to the diversity that is discovered.And because we are ultimately interested in explaining as much variation as we can, it is desirable to bring those theoretical widgets to bear on various elements of the diversity that is discovered in the descriptive research. And, finally, it is unrealistic to imagine that either description or theorizing can be conducted solely independently. Instead, description requires theorizing and conceptualizing, and theorizing requires some accurate descriptions of the world to work with. As Kant wrote in a different context, \"Concepts without percepts are empty, percepts without concepts are blind.\"(As I imagine the hypothetical example above I think of Alfred Russel Wallace's fine and detailed descriptions of the flora and fauna of the Malay archipelago, and the role that this detailed natural history played in the formation of his own and Darwin's theories of natural selection. The purpose of the theory was to find some degree of order in the intricate diversity of the biological domain. But the biology of species had a major advantage over the sociology of institutions and practices: there was in fact only one governing mechanism, random variation and selection, so it was possible to encompass the full range of observed diversity under a single ecological theory.  The case is different in the social world because there are multiple independent causes leading to social differentiation.)"}, {"title": "Social \"laws\" and causal mechanisms", "date": "Wednesday, January 2, 2008", "text": "Are there social regularities?

As a bottom line, I take the view that there are no \"social laws\" analogous to \"laws of nature\", even though there are some mid-level regularities that can be discovered across a variety of kinds of social phenomena.  But care is needed because of the constant temptation of naturalism -- the idea that the social world should be understood in strong analogy with the natural world.  If natural phenomena are governed by laws of nature, then social phenomena should be governed by \"laws of society.\"  But the analogy is false.Of course there are observable regularities among social phenomena.  Urban geographers have noticed a similar mathematical relationship in the size distribution of cities in a wide range of countries.  Durkheim noticed similar suicide rates among Catholic countries -- rates that differ consistently from those found in Protestant countries.  Political economists notice that there is a negative correlation between state spending on social goods  and the infant mortality rate.  And we could extend the list indefinitely.But what does this fact demonstrate?  Not, I want to argue, that social phenomena are \"law-governed\".  Instead, it results from two related facts.  First, there are social-causal mechanisms; and second, there is some recurrence of common causes across social settings.Take the mechanism of \"collective action failures in the presence of public goods.\"  Here the heart of the mechanism is the analytical point that rationally self-interested decision-makers will take account of private goods but not public goods; so they will tend to avoid investments in activities that produce public goods.  They will tend to become \"free riders\" or \"easy riders.\" The social regularity that corresponds to this mechanism is a \"soft\" generalization -- that situations that involve a strong component of collective opportunities for creating public goods will tend to demonstrate low contribution levels from members of affected groups.  So public radio fundraising will receive contributions only from a small minority of listeners; boycotts and strikes will be difficult to maintain over time; fishing resources will tend to be over-fished.  And in fact, these regularities can be identified in a range of historical and social settings.However, the \"free rider\" mechanism is only one of several that affect collective action.  There are other social mechanisms that have the effect of enhancing collective action rather than undermining it.  For example, the presence of competent organizations makes a big difference in eliciting voluntary contributions to public goods; the fact that many decision-makers appear to be \"conditional altruists\" rather than \"rationally self-interested maximizers\" makes a difference; and the fact that people can be mobilized to exercise sanctions against free riders affects the level of contribution to public goods.  (If your neighbors complain bitterly about your smoky fireplace, you may be incentivized to purchase a cleaner-burning wood or coal.) The result is that the free-rider mechanism rarely operates by itself -- so the expected regularities may be diminished or even extinguished.What I draw from this is pretty simple.  It is that social regularities are \"phenomenal\" rather than \"governing\": they emerge as the result of the workings of common social-causal mechanisms, and social causation is generally conjunctural and contingent.  So the regularities that become manifest are weak and exception-laden -- and they are descriptive of outcomes rather than expressive of underlying \"laws of motion\" of social circumstances.And there is a research heuristic that emerges from this discussion as well.  This is the importance of searching out the concrete social-causal mechanisms through which social phenomena take shape.  We do a poor job of understanding industrial strikes if we simply collect a thousand instances and perform statistical analysis on the features we've measured against the outcome variables.  We do a much better job of understanding them if we put together a set of theories about the features of structure and agency through which a strike emerges and through which individuals make decisions about participation.  Analysis of the common \"agent/structure\" factors that are relevant to mobilization will permit us to understand individual instances of mobilization, explain the soft regularities that we discover, and account for the negative instances as well."}, {"title": "Impersonal social causes?", "date": "Sunday, December 30, 2007", "text": "There is a substantial place in social causation for mechanisms that link the intentions of powerful actors to the specific features of the outcome.  \"The outcome came about because the powerful actor wanted it to.\"  Why are there no petroleum refineries in mid-town Manhattan? Because zoning and planning boards have deliberately excluded such activities. But what about causal mechanisms that are not the result of strategic choices by social actors? Are there impersonal social causes?There are rare but real instances of social changes that occur without any intermediary of social action -- for example, the eruption of Mount Vesuvius and the extinction of Pompeii. But these events fall outside the scope of the social sciences.  And there are important social explanations that begin in impersonal features of the natural environment -- for example, the configuration of rivers in China's early history. But what makes these into social explanations is the analysis of the social behavior through which agents adapt these conditions to their needs. (See Mark Elvin's truly excellent environmental history of China for more on this; The Retreat of the Elephants: An Environmental History of China.)  But social explanations always involve actors -- and that means that intentional social action always comes into the picture in some way.  So we might begin by saying that there are no impersonal social explanations, if by that we mean \"explanations of social outcomes that do not involve the actions of persons.\"It is important to observe that there are actually two distinctions that are relevant here. There is the \"personal-impersonal\" distinction, and there is the \"intended-unintended\" distinction. In an obvious sense all social causation is \"personal\", in the sense that social causal mechanisms are always embodied in the constrained actions of socially constituted actors or persons. So the actions of deliberate actors are part of all social causation. But the intentions of the actors are often unrelated to the social outcome we are trying to explain. So in these cases the outcome is not caused by actors' intention that it should come about. In the refinery example -- it may be that there is no regulation prohibiting this kind of activity, but the cost of real estate makes the proposition unattractive from a cost-benefit perspective. On this scenario we would have the result occurring as an unintended consequence of the choices of a large numbers of independent actors.These are the most interesting social explanations: explanations of social patterns or outcomes that are not the result of design or intention, but that nonetheless emerge through the purposive actions of large numbers of agents.  These are \"unintended consequences\" explanations or \"aggregative\" explanations.  We can quickly identify dozens of such examples: the silting of river deltas as a result of flood-management strategies upstream; the expansion of black-market sales of cigarettes as a result of new taxes on tobacco; the expansion of traffic flows as a result of the opening of the third harbor tunnel in Boston; etc.  These explanations are \"aggregative\" in the sense that they work by \"aggregating\" the lower-level choices and preferences of individual actors into a higher-level social pattern.  (Thomas Schelling offers numerous intriguing examples along these lines in his book, Micromotives and Macrobehavior.)So now we can answer our original question. There are no social causes that work entirely independently from social actors, and actors are purposive. So all social causation stems from \"intentional\" human behavior; persons are always involved in social outcomes.  However, there are many social outcomes that are unintended and unrecognized by all the participants.  The participants' intentions are local and parochial; whereas the social outcome is large and unforeseen. These instances are the most interesting problems for social inquiry. We might refer to these as \"agency-based explanations of unintended and unforeseen outcomes.\"This suggests a different way of classifying social causes: outcomes that are the intended result of specific powerful actors (conspiracy, leadership, dictatorship); outcomes that are the result of strategic interaction among a small group of purposive agents (bargaining, collusion, cooperation); outcomes that result from concerted collective action by large groups with some sense of collective goals (boycotts, strikes); and outcomes that are the aggregate result of uncoordinated but constrained choices by large numbers of independent agents (markets, habitation patterns).This classification also makes it more apparent why the concept of power is central in social explanation. The first three categories imply a distribution of powers across specific agents and groups, in order to account for the postulated connection between the agent's purposes and the eventual outcome. And the fourth category implies the exercise of power by some other agency, to account for the observed constraints on choice that constitute the heart of this type of explanation."}, {"title": "Power: corporations", "date": "Saturday, December 29, 2007", "text": "How do large corporations wield power? What are the kinds of outcomes that corporate leaders want to influence? What are the instruments available to them through which they can influence outcomes? And are there impersonal means through which corporations influence society -- i.e., wield power or exert causal influence?Consider first the outcomes. Corporations are businesses with interests. These include first and foremost profitability -- short, medium, and longterm.  Profitability is influenced by a number of economic, legal, and political factors: a favorable trading environment; a favorable environment for secure property and contract rights; a favorable regulatory environment; favorable and predictable relationships with the workforce and unions; and favorable attitudes from consumers and the public. So corporate officers are charged to do everything possible to bring about positive results for the company in all these spheres.Lobbying is a central activity through which the corporation pursues its agenda. The corporation employs professionals at a range of levels whose job it is to persuade and influence political and agency actors -- legislators, staffers, agency officials, lower-level agency workers who can influence regulations and findings. Lobbying works through personal relationships, campaign support (including campaign gifts), and other forms of influence. (The subject of corruption and conflict of interest and commitment comes in here, but not all lobbying effortfalls in that category.)Advertising, communications, and public relations are related efforts by the corporation through which the corporation exercises influence. The corporation expends substantial resources to \"get its message out\" -- and these expenditures have measurable effects. Targeted audiences change their opinions and behavior as a result of these efforts.So far we have identified instruments of suasion and incentives -- persuading various actors to act in ways that are favorable to the corporation. And these efforts are substantially effective because of the weight of the resources the corporation can devote to the effort. Are there also more coercive means available to the corporation? There are. A company can threaten various constituencies through redirection of business activities to compel actions favorable to its agenda. For example, it can threaten to close a factory, or to lay off a group of workers, or to move production to overseas locations. These threats influence the behavior of municipalities, state governments, and unions.In some historical circumstances corporations can also use violence and the threat of violence as part of its strategy for achieving its agenda. Examples of violence and intimidation can be found in China and Columbia today, and in the British and American business- labor struggles of the past. Violence and intimidation are among the tools through which strategic actors may pursue their goals.This inventory indicates that businesses behave strategically in pursuit of their interests; that they have means of influencing powerful political and social actors through resources, organization, and intimidation; and that the results of this strategic action over time significantly influence the social space in which business activity, political rule-setting, and labor  activism occur. In other words, corporations have significant causal powers in modern societies, and corporations constitute a significant locus of power in the contemporary world."}, {"title": "A non-naturalistic approach to social science", "date": "Friday, December 28, 2007", "text": "The most basic error that is conveyed by the naturalist framework into the premises of sociology\u2014the folk epistemology\u2014that was shared by Durkheim, Mill, and Comte, is the assumption that all phenomena are subject to laws; that the relevant laws are abstract and obscure; and that there is an orderly relationship between gross phenomena and a rising level of natural laws that embrace those observable phenomena.  The task of scientific study is to discover this rising pyramid of regularities and laws (motions of planets ENCOMPASSED BY elliptical orbits ENCOMPASSED BY gravitational attraction ENCOMPASSING other phenomena such as tides).  This model is then used to frame the sociologist\u2019s expectations of the orderliness of sociological observations and regularities.  The social world is assumed to be a system of phenomena governed by hidden regularities and causal laws; the task of social science research is to discover these governing regularities and laws. .  However, this conception of the world does not fit the domain of the social at all.We can provide an alternative social ontology\u2014a better grounding for sociological research. The social sciences could have begun with a greater degree of agnosticism about the orderliness of social phenomena.  We could have started with the observations that\u2014Social phenomena are created by human beings (deliberately, intentionally, or unknowingly)Human beings behave as a result of their socially constructed beliefs, values, goals, attitudes, modes of reasoning, emotions, \u2026There is a wide range of variation that is visible among social arrangements and institutions, across cultures, across space, and across time (long duration and short duration)Social institutions, organizations, and structures have a degree of observable stability across cohorts and generations of the human beings who make them upThere are social causes, and they are ordinary, observable, and mundane. They are variants of the agent-structure nexus.These initial ontological observations would have led us to some framing expectations about the social and about the likely results of social science inquiry:contingency of social outcomesVariation of social trajectoryPlasticity of social institutionsHeterogeneity among instances of a \u201ctype\u201d of social thingNo \u201claws of motion\u201d for development or modernizationAnd we might have set several research objectives for the social sciences:To study in some detail how various institutions work in different social settings (empirical, fact-driven observation and analysis)To study human behavior, motivation, and action \u2013 again, with sensibility to variation, without the assumption that there is one ultimate human nature or governing mode of behavior.To be as aware of variation and plasticity as we are attentive to the discovery of social regularitiesTo discover and theorize some of the causal mechanisms that can be observed within social processesTo identify weak regularities of behavior and institution through observationTo theorize these regularities in terms of agent-structure dynamics; aggregation of features of decision-making; unintended consequences. For example, free rider phenomena (economists) and self-regulating commons (common-property resource institutions)We then might have arrived at a different conception of what a \u201cfinished\u201d social science might involve: not a deductive theory with a few high-level generalizations and laws, but rather an \u201cagent-based simulation\u201d that embodies as many of the characteristics and varieties of behavior as possible into the simulation, and then projects different possible scenarios.  The ideal might have been \u201csim-society\u201d rather than deductive-nomological theory.Philosophy observes the sciences.  But it has also played a role in the formation of the sciences.  And this is especially true in the case of the social sciences.The idea here is an elusive one.  It is that the founders of the social sciences \u2013 perhaps similar to all intellectual or creative founders \u2013 possessed framing assumptions, presuppositions, or intuitions about what their eventual product ought to look like.  Various ideas capture some of this: presupposition, paradigm, guiding framework, tacit knowledge, or \u201cstyle\u201d.  A style of technology or architecture is a \u201cmindset\u201d that guides the creator into affirming one set of choices and denying another; ruling out certain solutions to a problem while favoring others.  And many of these ideas derived from philosophy -- for example, empiricism, rationalism, deductivism, atomism,  or reductionism.The nineteenth- and twentieth-century founders of the social sciences had a set of intellectual interests that led them to ask questions about the way that society works.  They were led to engage in careful, disciplined study of social phenomena.  But how to proceed?  What should the results look like?  What modes of explanation should be pursued?  What should they expect to find?  None of the founders proceeded with a \u201cblank slate\u201d.  Instead, they were guided by specific intellectual hunches and presuppositions about what a scientific treatment of a subject ought to involve.  The histories of physics, chemistry, and biology were very well known to the founders, and the chief logical characteristics of the science of these domains were also well understood.  The \u201cstylized facts\u201d about what a domain of inquiry is and what a scientific study of a domain involves were fairly specific.  It turns out that these facts were misleading in deep and broad ways when applied to the social world.  And contemporary sociology continues to bear the imprint of these early presuppositions.We might be tempted to call these assumptions about domain, method, and theory a \u201cparadigm\u201d, but it is better to think of them as constituting a \u201cproto-paradigm\u201d. \u201cParadigm\u201d describes a more advanced stage of the formation of a field of knowledge. The framing ideas that guided the founders were less specific; they represented high-level, abstract presuppositions about the nature of science and the nature of any subject matter that is amenable to scientific study and explanation.  They constitute a framework of advanced commonsense about the subject matter.  We might describe this framework as a \u201cfolk philosophy of knowledge\u201d that is to some extent unexamined but that guides the pursuit of knowledge, the form that it takes, and the ways in which it is evaluated.Given these historical circumstances, naturalism as a \"proto-paradigm\" for the social sciences is unsurprising\u2014even though it is profoundly misleading.  The strongest \u2014 really, the only \u2014 examples of scientific achievement in the nineteenth century were in the fields of chemistry, physics, medicine, and biology.  There was a developed \u201cproto-theory\u201d of nature that was the object of scientific study (the characteristics and metaphysics of law-governed natural phenomena).  The natural world was conceived of as a system of law-governed events and processes.  And the logical characteristics of natural science theory were reasonably well understood as well: induction, discovery of laws and regularities, explanation through assimilation within a set of natural laws, confirmation.There is a fundamental problem with this set of \"naturalistic\" presuppositions: social phenomena are constituted by a fundamentally different ontology.  \"Agents in structures\" are the fundamental \"molecules\" of social life -- and this ontology should not be expected to give rise to strong regularities.  Instead, we should expect a substantial amount of heterogeneity and plasticity among social entities and processes, and we should expect contingency and path-dependency in the unfolding of social phenomena."}, {"title": "A \"peasant\" revolution?", "date": "Thursday, December 27, 2007", "text": "The Chinese communist party became a peasant revolutionary party after the spectacular destruction of the urban basis of the movement by Chiang Kai-shek in Shanghai in 1927. But who and what was a peasant, and how did this group become a revolutionary group?In one sense the answer is obvious. China's population consisted of a majority of poor farmers at the time of the collapse of the Qing dynasty, under a variety of forms of land tenure. They were poor, had little land, and were subject to exploitation by landlords, lenders, and the state. So we might say that this answers both questions: peasants were poor farmers, they were a large majority throughout China, and they were potentially revolutionary as a result of their poverty and exploitation. All that was needed was a party that could mobilize and activate them.This response is too simple, however, for several reasons. First, the concept of peasant is a social and political construction. A \"farmer\" is an agricultural producer; but this fact about production status tells us little about how rural people defined their own social realities or the way that others defined them.Second, the mobilization of \"peasants\" along class lines requires an organized political effort by a party that aggressively makes for the salience of class over other affinities -- kinship, lineage, regional identity, or ethnicity.  Marx expressed his assessment of the lack of solidarity of the French peasantry of the 1840s in these terms: \"A small-holding, a peasant and his family; alongside them another small-holding, another peasant and another family. A few score of these make up a village, and a few score of villages make up a Department. In this way, the great mass of the French nation is formed by simple addition of homologous magnitudes, much as potatoes in a sack form a sack of potatoes\" (Marx, The Eighteenth Brumaire of Louis Bonaparte).  In order for a population to become a self-conscious identity group, it is necessary for a deliberate process of identity-formation to take place.  The CCP worked single-mindedly to create this affinity with class identity throughout the 1920-30s in rural China. (Lucien Bianco, Peasants Without the Party: Grass-Root Movements in Twentieth-Century China; Odoric Wou, Mobilizing the Masses: Building Revolution in Henan.)And third, it turns out that the politically defined status of \"peasant\" incorporated its own definition of internal inequality -- between rich, middle, and poor peasants. These terms of internal differentiation played a prominent role in the mobilization strategies and policies of the CCP in its drive to revolution.  The CCP emphasized conflicts within the class of peasants as much as the conflicts between peasants and others.The mobilization strategies of the CCP of the 1930s were aimed at creating a large and energized supporting population of poor and middle peasants. They pursued this goal by recruiting local cadres who could communicate the party message to their intended supporters and by offering a program of land reform and social reversal that would strongly appeal to this group. Their efforts were successful in several important base areas, and the CCP was in fact able to cultivate a loyal base among poor and middle peasants. Moreover, this group increasingly provided recruits for middle and higher positions of leadership in the military and political organizations of the party.So we might say that the peasant movement was in fact created and shaped by CCP doctrines in the 1930s as a contingent but portentious social force in China.  And for the first 30 years of the Chinese communist state serious efforts were made to retain the loyalties of this social segment.To explain an outcome is to demonstrate what conditions combined to bring it about -- what caused the outcome in the circumstances, or caused it to be more likely to occur. The most fundamental aspect of an explanation is a hypothesis about what caused the circumstance we want to explain.  So social explanation requires that we provide accounts of the social causes of social outcomes. (There may be non-social causes of social outcomes -- e.g. \"The Roman Empire declined because of the high concentrations of lead in wine vessels\"; but these extra-social explanations don't really fall within the social sciences.)So we need to raise two sorts of questions. First, what kind of thing is a social cause -- how do social facts cause other social facts? And second, what kind of social research can allow us to identify the causes of a social outcome or pattern? (Notice that explaining an outcome is very different from explaining a pattern.)Generally speaking, a cause is a condition that either necessitates or renders more probable its effect, in a given environment of conditions.  (For the philosophers, this means that \"C is sufficient in the circumstances to bring about E or to increase the likelihood of E.\") Normally a cause is also necessary for the production of its effect -- \"if C had not occurreD, E would not have occurred.\" (The probabilistic version: \"If C had not occurred, the likelihood of E would have been lower.) (Wesley Salmon explores the intricacies in much greater detail -- Scientific Explanation and the Causal Structure of the World.)This account depends upon something that Hume abhorred: the idea of necessity. For natural causes we have a suitable candidate in the form of natural necessity deriving from the laws of nature: \"C and the laws of nature => necessarily E.\" However, there are no \"laws of society\" that function ontologically like laws of nature.  So how can there be \"social necessity\"?  Fortunately, there is an alternative to law-based necessity, in the form of a causal mechanism. A mechanism is a particular configuration of conditions that always leads from one set of conditions to an outcome. Mechanisms bring about specific effects.  (So we might say that mechanisms are widgets of natural laws.) For example, \"over-grazing of the commons\" is a mechanism of resource depletion. And it is the case that, whenever the conditions of the mechanism are satisfied, the result ensues. Moreover, we can reconstruct precisely why this would be true for rationally self-interested actors in the presence of a public good. So we can properly understand a claim for social causation along these lines: \"C causes E\" means \"there is a set of causal mechanisms that convey circumstances including C to circumstances including E.\"Are there any social mechanisms? There are many examples.  \"Collective action problems often cause strikes to fail.\" \"Increasing demand for a good causes prices to rise for the good in a competitive market.\" \"Transportation systems cause shifts of social activity anad habitation.\"So this provides an answer to the first question: explaining a social outcome or pattern involves providing an account of the social-causal mechanisms that typically bring it about, or brought it about in specific circumstances.Now let us turn to inquiry. How would we detect social causation? Fundamentally there are only three ways. We can exploit the mechanism requirement and seek out particular or common social mechanisms. Both social theory and process-tracing can serve us here. Second, we can exploit the probabilistic implications of a causal claim by looking for correlations and conditional probabilities among the conditions associated with hypothesized causal mechanisms. This feature underpins standard \"large-N\" quantitative research methods in social science. And third, we can exploit the \"necessary and sufficient condition\" feature by using comparative methods like Mill's methods.  In each case, we must keep fully in mind the centrality of causal mechanisms. A discovery of a statistical association between X and Y is suggestive of causation, but we need to be able to hypothesize the mechanism that would underly the association if we are to attribute causation.  Likewise, the discovery that a study of multiple cases suggests that A is necessary for E and A&B are sufficient for E requires us to consider the question, what is the concrete social mechanism that links A, B, and E?"}, {"title": "What is \"understanding social life\"?", "date": "Tuesday, December 25, 2007", "text": "There have been two very different approaches to social explanation since the nineteenth century, and they differ most basically over a distinction between \"explanation\" and \"understanding\" or \"cause\" and \"meaning\". This distinction divides over two ways of understanding a \"why\" question when it comes to social events. \"Why did it happen?\" may mean \"What caused it to happen?\"; or it may mean \"Why did the agents act in such a way to bring it about?\".The verstehen approach holds that the most basic ontology of social life is the meaning of an action. Social life is constituted by social actions, and actions are meaningful to the actors and to the other social participants. Moreover, subsequent actions are oriented towards the meanings of prior actions; so understanding the later action requires that we have an interpretation of the meanings that various participants assign to their own actions and those of others. (Central exponents of this tradition include Weber, Dilthey, Heidegger, Ricoeur, and Gadamer.)This approach places interpretation of meaning at the center of social inquiry. And it drew much of its methodology and tools of inquiry from the hermeneutic tradition -- the tradition of biblical and literary interpretation stemming from Dilthey and other nineteenth-century German thinkers.  This tradition is adapted to the \"human sciences\" by using the metaphor of action as text. The interpreter (a biographer, for example) considers the many elements of the action, life, or complex of actions, and attempts to arrive at an interpretation that makes sense of the various parts.A central problem that authors in this tradition wrestle with is the \"hermeneutic circle\" -- the fact that there is no neutral, external standpoint from which to objectively measure the meaning of a system of signs or actions. Instead, interpretation begins and ends with the given -- the text or the action -- and the only evidence available for assessing the interpretation is interior to the text itself. So it may appear that interpretations are self-confirming -- an unhappy conclusion if we think that social explanations ought to have rational justification and empirical support.The hermeneutic approach got a large boost from the fertile field of interpretive anthropology in the 1970s and 1980s, especially through the work of Clifford Geertz and Turner. However, there is little evidence of a direct intellectual connection from hermeneutic philosophy to interpretive anthropology.There are several valid insights that the verstehen approach depends on. Most important is the insistence on the point that social action is meaningful and intentional, and that it is both desirable and feasible to arrive at interpretations of these meanings. Moreover, being able to arrive at such interpretations is often essential to historical and ethnographic explanation. Geertz's interpretation of the Balinese cock-fight and Darnton's interpretation of the great cat massacre both illustrate this point: in neither case would we understand the behavior without a deep interpretation of the significances the participants attribute to their actions.This said, it is incorrect to imagine that the verstehen approach is inconsistent with the causal approach. Rather, the two approaches are compatible and complementary. It is a fact that human action is meaningful and intentional, and all social science must take account of this fact. But it is also true that actions aggregate to larger causes and they have effects on social outcomes. Meaningful, deliberate action is often the mechanism through which a given set of institutional arrangements (a property system, say) cause a social outcome (slow investment in new technologies, say). So meanings are themselves causes and causal mechanisms (a point that Donald Davidson makes in the case of individual action).Finally, a social science that restricted itself to hermeneutic interpretation would be radically incomplete. It would exclude from the scope of social science research the whole range of causal relationships, structural influences on action, and the workings of unintended consequences in social processes."}, {"title": "What is to explain about violent crime?", "date": "Saturday, December 22, 2007", "text": "Every city has a crime rate -- the incidence of murders, assaults, car thefts, or burglaries per 100,000 residents.  And there are very significant differences across cities and countries with respect to the incidence of violent crime.  In particular, some cities in the world experience extremely high levels in the incidence of violent crimes (for example, Johannesburg, South Africa). Compare these national statistics describing \"murders per 100,000 population\": England/Wales, 1; USA, 6; Brazil and Russia, 21; Columbia, 58; South Africa, 59. Why is this? Why are some cities and countries so much more violent than others?  What are the most important factors that cause a community to have a high (or low) rate of violent crime?  Why do individuals in some societies have a higher propensity for violent crime than in others?The study of the causes of violence and crime has been a part of western sociology since the beginning. A variety of causes have been suggested: the incidence of absolute poverty, the extent of inequalities, the phenomenon of relative deprivation, the drug trade, the breakdown of traditional community and family values, and the effects of racism, to name a few.Notice that we can put the causal question in several ways:What causes variation across communities with respect to crime rates?What factors increase the likelihood of a particular individual becoming a violent criminal?What social factors cause an increase or reduction in the crime rate?That is, we can ask about explaining variation across cases; we can ask about explaining particular individuals' behavior; we can ask about \"inducing\" and \"inhibiting\" causes of changes in the crime rate; and there are other causal questions as well. The final pair of questions have to do with explaining variation within a case across time.Consider this small set of possible causal factors that might influence behavior:rational incentives (risk and gain calculation)material circumstances (unemployment, education)community cohesivenessa broad sense of injustice (exploitation, unfair exclusion)moral and religious valuesalienation and disaffection racial or ethnic polarizationimitation of the behavior of othersorganizations (gangs, youth groups, social networks)laws and policingNow we might try to construct an agent-centered theory of violent crime based on these sorts of factors conjoined with a description of the social environment at the time -- and then predict variation across time and place as a behavioral result of the incorporation of these factors influencing action.A very different approach -- and one that is probably closer to the quantitative-methodology mainstream in sociology today -- is to assemble a set of cases (a list of US cities, for example); measure a number of variables for each city (unemployment rate, index of social capital, level of education, degree of neighborhood segregation, presence/absence of mass transportation, ...); and then test the degree of correlation that one or more of these variables has with the observed variation in the crime rate. Do variations in the incidence of violent crime correlate with levels of unemployment?  Then unemployment is a plausible causal factor in determining the level of the crime rate.  Does some measure of social capital correlate negatively with variations in the crime rate?  Then the social cohesion that is hypothetically linked to higher scores for social capital in a community is a negative causal factor in variations in the crime rate.  And so forth.Both these approaches are compatible with the research methodology associated with trying to identify causal mechanisms.  If it is in fact true that a young person's disposition to engaging in violent crime is decreased if he/she is a member of a church -- then we ought to find at the macro-level that a higher index of church membership will be associated with a lower crime rate.  Reciprocally, if we discover a positive correlation between \"degree of neighborhood segregation\" and the crime rate -- then we need to be able to disaggregate the story and discover the individual-level mechanisms through which segregation increases individuals' propensity for violent crime."}, {"title": "What kind of social knowledge does a football coach have?", "date": "Friday, December 21, 2007", "text": "I am struck by the difference between the football game that I watch, as a not-very-involved fan, and the one that the experienced coach or sportswriter sees.  For me the game is a series of fast-moving passes, tackles, runs, interceptions, touchdowns, and athletic movements.  But it doesn't make a lot of sense as a whole -- either within a single play or over an extended period of the game.  Contrast that with the perceptions of the game by an experienced, expert observer.  A football expert sees more than the individual movements; he sees an organized play unfolding; a missed assignment; an opportunistic change-of-plan by the quarterback; and a feature of a game plan that can gradually be inferred.  In other words, the expert sees the movements of the players as a complex of strategic behavior, skilled performance, planning, and opportunistic adjustment.What kind of cognition is this?  What is the cognitive difference between the expert and non-expert observer?  And how does this relate to social knowledge more generally?Let's take the last question first.  Observing the football game is a lot like observing many other kinds of complex relational social interactions: a political campaign, a disaster involving hundreds of victims and responders, or a riot.  The football game involves coordination among an number of purposive actors; a degree of organizational structure; the design and implementation of plans; processes of communication (successful and unsuccessful); and the ability of actors to respond to each other's movements on the fly.  (To change sports -- when Larry Bird stole the inbound pass from Isiah Thomas in the last seconds of a celebrated playoff game against the Pistons, his teammate Dennis Johnson was already streaking to the basket in anticipation of the possibility of a stolen pass; he then made an uncontested layup and won the game.)  These are common features of complex social interactions.  So the football game is a complex, structured, and layered social event that unfolds over time; and the meaning and causes of particular actions and events are obscure to the casual observer, whereas they are apparent to the expert.Perceiving the football game as a social event unfolding in time requires more than simply registering the movements of the players on the field.  It is necessary to frame these movements within an apperception of the strategies and intentions that lie behind the actions: the attempt to deceive the opponent (fast footwork, the hidden ball trick); the sudden break to the center of the field by the receiver; the quarterback's effort to buy time until a receiver becomes open.  We need to have a basis for saying \"what they are doing\" that goes beyond a description of the movements and steps taken.  And for the expert, a rich framework of understandings of actions, intentions, and strategies is brought to the observation of the particular play.  The expert is able to place the actions of the quarterback, the left tackle, and the three receivers into a context of understandable actions and choices; and he is able to discern when something has gone wrong (receiver turned left rather than right, left tackle missed a block, quarterback panicked and threw the ball away ...). I want to suggest that the expert's perception of the play on the field is a complex but veridical observation of a concrete relational social phenomenon; that it is more akin to perception than to theory formation; and that it reflects a complicated cognitive process through which the expert assembles a lot of knowledge about the game, about the habits and practices of players, about common strategies and tactics -- and that all of this gets sized up in a quick apperception of the specific play.  Finally, I want to suggest that this apperception is enormously richer than the crude empirical observations that the non-expert makes: \"the center seems to have slipped, the pass was complete\". If this analysis of the situation of the two observers -- expert and duffer -- is plausible, it has important implications for the knowledge that we have of other, less trivial forms of social interaction.  Does the experienced labor organizer have a similar ability to size up a crowded shop floor and see where the stress points are, and who the likely leaders are?  Does a field officer in the infantry have the ability to mentally organize the flow of the battle through the fog of war and arrive at a perception of how things are going -- and what might work as a tactic for the next day?  Does the ethnographer have the ability to put together the social cues that permit him or her to conclude that \"there is some angry disagreement among members of the village today\"?  In each case I suspect that there is a good basis for saying, \"yes, this is how observation of complex social situations goes for the expert observer.\"  And this implies that there is a kind of social knowledge that is analogous to perception even though it involves a very great amount of cognitive construction."}, {"title": "Empirical constraints on sociological theories", "date": "Tuesday, December 18, 2007", "text": "What makes sociology \"scientific\"? An important component of a reply is that assertions, hypotheses, and theories are subject to the test of empirical evidence.  Hypotheses need to be evaluated in terms of observations of how the real world behaves. We should evaluate our assertions in terms of their fit with the empirical facts.  This is the \"empiricist\" constraint.Post-positivist philosophers of science have noticed that these simple ideas raise many of puzzles, however. Consider these points:No set of observable facts guarantees the truth of a scientific assertion.There is no sharp distinction between observation and theory; our observations of the empirical facts commonly depend upon the assumption of some elements of scientific theory. Observations are \"theory-laden\".Even the empirical \"facts\" are subject to multiple interpretations; it is often possible to redescribe a set of observations in a way that appears to support contradictory hypotheses.In the social sciences there are additional complexities about how to arrive at empirical observations and measurements.Social observations require us to \"operationalize\" the empirical facts we want to observe. For example, we may want to observe the standard of living of the working class. But we cannot achieve this directly. Instead, we need to arrive at \"proxies\" that are plausibly indicative of the property in question. So the wage basket that can be purchased with a given average money wage may be the index we use for measuring the standard of living. But there are other defensible ways of operationalizing the standard of living, and the various criteria may yield results that behave differently in given times and places.Social observation requires aggregation of measurements over a diverse group of individuals. We have to make judgments and choices when we arrive at a process for aggregating social data -- for example, the choice of using the gini coefficient rather than the share of income flowing to the bottom 40 percent as a measure of income inequality, or using the median rather than the mean to observe changes in income distribution. These choices must be made -- and there are no decisive empirical reasons that would decide the issue.Social concepts are needed to allow us to break down the social world into a set of facts. But there are plausible alternative conceptual schemes through which we can understand the nature and varieties of social phenomena. So, once again, we cannot hold that \"observation\" determines \"theory\".These are familiar logical difficulties with the basic requirement of empiricism. However, they are not fatal difficulties. At bottom, it remains true that there is such a thing as social observation. It is necessary to accept that observations are theory-laden; that no observation is uncontrovertible; and that empirical evaluation depends upon judgment. All this accepted, there is a range of social observation that is relatively close to the ground and to which we can attribute some degree of epistemic warrant. Finally, there is available to us a coherence epistemology that permits a holistic and many-sided process of conveying warrant.My view, then, is that the situation of sociology is less like physics (highly dependent on long chains of reasoning in order to assess empirical warrant) and more like journalism (grounded in careful and reasoned constructions of observations of the social world). The social world is reasonably transparent. We can arrive at reasonably confident observations of a wide range of social facts. And we can provide a logical analysis of the degree of credibility a given sociological theory has, given a fixed set of (corrigible) observations. Much of sociology is closely tied to descriptive inquiry, and the epistemic challenges come in at the stage of building our observations rather than our theories.Moreover, the common views that natural science theories are \"under-determined\" by all available evidence (so that multiple theories can be equally well supported) and that scientific theories can only be supported or undermined as wholes (with no separate confirmation for parts of theories) appear to be largely inapplicable to the social sciences.  Rather, social theories are more commonly of the \"middle range\", permitting piecemeal observation, testing, and empirical evaluation.This also means that the celebrated hypothetico-deductive model of confirmation is less crucial in the social sciences than the natural sciences. The key explanatory challenge is to discover a set of causal processes that might explain the observed social world. And sophisticated observation is often the bulk of what we need.(See \"Evidence and Objectivity in the Social Sciences\" for a little more on this topic. Ian Shapiro's recent book, The Flight from Reality in the Human Sciences, is a tough critique of excessive formalism and theor-ism in the social sciences.)"}, {"title": "Area studies and social science knowledge", "date": "Friday, December 14, 2007", "text": "How do the social sciences complement the study of particular regions and cultures? How do the researches and theories of political science, sociology, or anthropology extend our understanding of China or Mexico?There is one answer to this question that can be disposed of fairly quickly: many sociologists, economists, or political scientists are also specialists on China or Mexico. In this case the social scientist finds his/her empirical data in a particular place -- and the research findings produced through this specialized inquiry is a substantive contribution to understanding of the particular region. In this sense the specialist is a contributor to the area studies literature on China or Mexico (or Latin America and East Asia).But area studies is more than simply the accumulation of knowledge of a region based on several distinct disciplines. Somehow we think that area studies researchers need to be inter-disciplinary experts. The scholar of East Asia needs to be able to synthesize the bestavailable insights from a range of disciplines. When we ask, what are the important processes underway in China today, we want to have a response that incorporates observations and judgments that include sociology, popular culture, economic policy, demography, and urban change. So an area specialist is not primarily a discipline specialist -- even though he/she normally has received primary training in one discipline or another. Instead, the area specialist is a specialist of the region, encompassing all its social and cultural aspects.Put this way, are there any genuine area experts? There are some leading writers on China whose work is interdisciplinary in a meaningful way -- Ezra Vogel, for example. And there are journalists who have developed broad and deep knowledge about Africa, Latin America, or East Asia. However, as a general rule, the deck is stacked against the \"discipline-generalist, region-specialist\" combination. This has partly to do with the discipline-based standards of rigor that define scholarly excellence; partly the sheer difficulty of mastering multiple areas of disciplinary knowledge; and partly with the epistemic value that we associate with detail and precision over breadth and lower resolution.So if a real \"area specialist\" is likely to be a rare creature, what should we look for when we want knowledge of a region or area? The most promising answer is the inter-disciplinary working group and  the inter-disciplinary scholarly association. A center for Chinese studies is likely to include experts across the social sciences and humanities; and they are all likely to acquire new perspectives through their cross-discipline interactions.  And perhaps the best knowledge we can reach about a region and culture is the multithreaded fabric that emerges from the research seminars and writings emanating from the area-studies working group.  Certainly organizations like the Asian Studies Association and the Middle Eastern Studies Association have proven their worth in bringing together a variety of disciplines and perspectives on their regions; and arguably, the scholars who participate in these associations have come to a broader perspective on their own particular areas of research.So, once again, what is the relation between knowledge of a region and knowledge of a social science discipline?  The area specialist needs to be informed by the best social science knowledge of the region. Second, he/she needs to be fluent with the best models and theories being developed in the social sciences, in order to be able to use these theories in explaining various patterns or developments in the region of interest. But, third, the area specialist should keep always in mind the cross-disciplinary nature of the subject matter. It is important not to be seduced by the power of the hammer, into thinking everything is a nail."}, {"title": "Explaining large social formations: fascism", "date": "Wednesday, December 12, 2007", "text": "In a previous post I discussed the problem of explaining fascism. Let's return to this issue as a topic for historical and social inquiry.There are clearly a number of different explanatory questions we might have in mind: why did fascist movements emerge and gain popular support in the first three decades of the twentieth century? Why did these movements prevail in several countries and not in others? (This version parallels Skocpol's question about revolutions.) Why did fascist states develop the political institutions they did in Germany, Italy, and Spain? How did fascist states and leaders exercise power? What prevented the rise of powerful fascist movements on France and Britain -- in spite of the presence of ultra-nationalist leaders and organizations?These are all different questions -- even if there are relations among them. A particularly central question concerns the factors that were conducive to the emergence of extremist beliefs and organizations in certain periods and what factors favored the growth and power of some of these movements. This is a bundle of questions about the conditions that favor collective mobilization and ideological formation on a mass society. It is the sort of research question that Chuck Tilly and other scholars of popular mobilization have been concerned with.Another set of questions about the course of fascism has more to do with institution building and state formation. Given the goal of creating powerful stare institutions within the general framework of fascist ideas and goals, what institutional and organizational possibilities existed? Here we might refer to the repertoire of mass organization that fascist \"revolutionaries\" brought to their movement, as well as the historical and practical options that existed. This area of inquiry may provide a basis for answering questions about the\u00a0particular nature of fascist political institutions.Finally, the distinct question of why it was that fascist movements and leaders were able to defeat democratic movements and states requires that we identify some of the circumstances that weakened democratic regimes. This may be a wide range of factors: challenges of war, ideological conflict with communists and other critics of the state, and the economic circumstances of the great depression.  (These fall in the same category as the circumstances that Skocpol brings forward as being relevant to the success or failure of revolutions.)It would appear that social scientists and historians have better tools for addressing the issue of successful mobilization than the institutional or causal conditions surrounding seizure of power and state building. Schematically, we might consider a causal narrative along these lines: Conditions that favor fascism include the presence of a marginalized group of young people who are subject to great economic insecurity; an ideology that combines nationalism, ethnic suspicion, and disaffection from established social institutions and values, and a compelling narrative of how and why this group ought to wield power. To this we might add a few propitious international conditions: the threat of war, a widening economic crisis, and a broad view that the modern state isn't up to handling these challenges.This approach sketches out a view of what might be a basis for an explanation of the rise of fascist social movements.  Here we have singled out several causal-social factors that facilitate popular mobilization and the politicization of social movements.  What it doesn't yet explain is why and in what circumstances these movements are likely to grow powerful enough to challenge the existing state structure; this remains for another discussion."}, {"title": "What is a \"moral intuition\"?", "date": "Tuesday, December 11, 2007", "text": "We have all had this experience: we hear of a complicated social or personal event, and we think inwardly, \"that's wrong!\" A co-worker tells us an embarrassing private story about another co-worker; we hear on the news that the number of children in poverty has increased; we read about a mining company that has dumped toxic chemicals into fishing rivers for years.  And we have a moral intuition about what we hear -- not only a quick judgment about its goodness or badness, but also a sketch of reasons: \"She shouldn't violate Frank's privacy that way\"; \"so much suffering of the innocent is awful\"; \"how can a company have such disregard for the people whose lives depend on those rivers.\"  In other words, we have intuitions about complex situations that evidently rest upon some kind of reasoning -- but we haven't deliberated about the case.What is the nature of such an intuition, and what kind of cognition does it represent?As I've sketched it out, these \"intuitions\" are cognitively complex -- not just an inward \"ugh!\", but a sketchy representation of facts, assumptions, and relevant principles or rules.  Our thought processes have somehow organized the description of the event into a story of sorts, along with some collateral judgments or principles about how people and institutions ought to behave.  In the moment of intuition, we are also involved in judgment; and judgment involves something like reasoning and analysis.  And yet the intuition itself is revealed in a moment -- not as a developing piece of analysis and deliberation, but an apparently instantaneous moment of moral perception.If this description is phenomenologically correct, then moral intuitions are a feature of human judgment that involves complexity in something like the way that sizing up an auto accident occurs for the experienced investigator -- a quick cognition of the likely speeds and directions of the vehicles, the evasive action that appears to have occurred (skidmarks), etc.   Following Kant, we might call this an act of \"apperception\", happening below the level of consciousness but bringing to bear quite a bit of analysis, knowledge, and principle in the construction of the resultant perception.  And we might refer to an individual's overall set of interpretive frameworks as his or her \"moral sensibility\".  Our moral sensibility provides us with a set of framing possibilities within the context of which we can begin to understand and represent the complicated human situations we encounter.Now we can give a bit more content to the roles that moral analysis and principle play in this story.  We are more or less forced to hypothesize that the person possesses a mental process of moral / social cognition that assembles a representation of a situation, including incorporation of a background set of principles or interpretive rules as well as a set of facts about the case, that eventuates in a morally tagged picture or narrative.  The person is able to dig down into some of the underlying architecture of this picture if pressed; this accounts for the fact that we can give some analysis or explanation of our moral intuitions when asked, \"why do you think this situation is wrong?\".  And the principles or rules that play an evaluative role are themselves learned through some concrete process of social development.  (Though it is interesting to consider whether there might be a component of social cognition that is hard-wired through our evolutionary history; Alan Gibbard, Wise Choices, Apt Feelings: A Theory of Normative Judgment).So one's moral intuitions are not grounded in something like \"direct apprehension of moral facts\"; rather, they are the result of a complex, conditioned, and fallible process of sub-conscious reconstruction of the circumstances of a case.  And for this reason we might suspect that there will be significant differences across individuals and across cultures in the contents of people's moral intuitions about cases.(It is worthwhile to contrast the idea of a moral intuition with John Rawls's idea of a \"considered judgment\".  Rawls's idea captures the conception of a full, deliberative consideration of a case in detail, considering all the relevant facts and principles, the fit between a given judgment and many other judgments we make, and a host of other constraints of coherence.  This picture is one of full, transparent moral reasoning and deliberation.  The account of moral intuition just provided is non-deliberative but not for that reason non-rational.)(This treatment of moral intuitions converges somewhat with Malcolm Gladwell's Blink: The Power of Thinking Without Thinking.)"}, {"title": "Aggregating social trends", "date": "Saturday, December 8, 2007", "text": "Would we say that discerning and aggregating social trends is an important kind of social knowledge? What about explaining social trends? What is a social trend, anyway?Suppose people notice that crimes are getting less frequent but more violent; or that Thai restaurants are replacing Chinese restaurants at the bottom end in Chicago; or that young people are using instant messages more than telephone or email. Are these social trends? I suppose that, most simply,  these are statements about changing frequencies of certain kinds of social occurrences over time.  And \"noticing\" means counting and tracking the results of past observations. There are important conceptual and measurement issues here -- how we identify the kinds of events whose frequency is \"important\" or \"of interest\"? How do we assure that we are counting in a way that is accurate -- not over- or under-reporting? But the basic logic is fairly clear. To say that there is a trend for X is to say that the frequency of X relative to the population is changing in a sustained way.Is the discovery of social trends an important effort for sociology? Probaby so, for several reasons. We are interested in knowing \"how society is changing\" -- and the frequencies of various kinds of social actions are themselves an important component of social change. So discovering and documenting changing patterns of social behavior -- \"trend-spotting\" -- is an important piece of sociological discovery.But there are two other reasons to think trends are important for sociology. A trend (more Thai restaurants) may be an indicator of some other more important social change -- aging of the Chinese population in Chicago, or an influx of Southeast Asian immigrants in a certain time period.  But, second, some social trends may function as causes of other future changes in social behavior. A rising trend in male-female sex ratios in China or India may be a potential cause of future social disorder; A rising frequency of soccer violence may be both an indication of rising youth alienation and a cause of future state action (more repression, more social welfare intervention). A trend towards longer sentences for non-violent crime may produce a rise in violent crime in the future (as non-violent criminals \"graduate\" to violent crime through longer exposure to violent criminals). Finally, discovery of trends can produce strategies of adaptive behavior -- trends in consumer taste may permit some businesses to create a whole new market for a product, trends in violent crime may produce new policing strategies, and trends in young voters using the web for communication may suggest new campaign tactics.Finally, it should be noted that some \"trends\" may not be true features of social behavior at all, but rather the reslt of heightened awareness of certain kinds of social behavior. (Teachers often say \"our students are getting worse every year\" ... even though the statistics on performance say the opposite.)We asked above what is involved in explaining social trends. Surely there must be a range of different social mechanisms that would produce change in the frequencies of various social behaviors: incentives, filters, external shocks, imitation, changes in the composition of the underlying population. For example, suppose we observe a trend towards fewer incidents of purse-snatching in Miami, and we observe as well that the median age of the population hasincreased from 50 to 60. The change in the age structure may explain the trend. In this case, there may be no change at all in the behaviors of the various age groups -- no trend there -- but a change in frequency relative to the total population nonetheless.(This discussion of \"social trends\" places the concept in the domain of \"changing distributions of individual social behavior\".  Is there a structural counterpart about collective entities? Can we make true and justified statements about the trends of change among -- labor unions, states, churches, or universities?)"}, {"title": "Explaining fascism", "date": "Friday, December 7, 2007", "text": "Kevin Passmore's short introduction to fascism comes out at a good time (Fascism: A Very Short Introduction). Passmore does a great job of framing the problem. He poses a definitional question -- what is fascism -- and demonstrates that this apparently semantic issue requires careful historical and theoretical analysis.  Arriving at a good definition of fascism is itself an empirical and historical task.  Passmore asks a set of causal questions: How do the fascisms of Europe relate to important social forces in the early twentieth century (for example, the role of great social classes in conflict)? And he addresses the issue of saying what is involved in explaining fascism (the role of analysis and theory).  Passmore also presents a very sophisticated treatment of the variety and diversity of human institutions -- issues raised elsewhere under the topic of \"heterogeneity\".Of special interest for us is the question, Is fascism a particular social system (dictatorship with such-and-so attributes)? Or was it first and foremost a historically distinctive political and social movement with characteristic values and ideology (violence, nationalism, anti-communism)? Is it a historically specific moment, or is it a systemic development stimulated by some structural feature of modern society (deadlocked conflict between workers and the bourgeoisie)? Crudely -- is fascism a social formation, an ideological complex, a social movement, or a type of government apparatus?  And our efforts of explanation will depend on what sort of answer we give to these ontological questions.These alternative definitions of fascism would give rise to very different explanatory challenges.  And in fact, there is a wide variety of explanatory and causal questions that can be considered:  Why did the fascist movements arise? Why did they gain a mass following? How did the social realities of capitalism affect the emergence and form of fascism? How important were the particular qualities and ideas of Hitler, Mussolini, or Franco in the evolution of fascism as a social system? Why did fascist dictatorships take the form they did? Why did official and affiliate group violence take the virulent forms that it did? How did fascist governments maintain power? Did these governments gain \"legitimacy\" and support in their populations?  Is there a characteristic \"pattern of development\" for fascist regimes, or are their political histories deeply contingent on events and persons? Are Germany, Italy, and Spain variants of one social form, or are they simply independent social systems possessing some family resemblances in ideology, propaganda systems, and propensities for violence? We might also consider whether explanation needs to occur at a lower level -- not \"why fascism?\" but rather, \"why the Iron Guard in Romania\", \"why this or that feature of Italian fascism\", \"why this particular feature of Spanish state-military relations in Franco's fascism?\". Here the point might be that there are no general or comprehensive explanations of the emergence and development of fascism in all the places it occurred; no common causes that were always or usually instrumental; but rather that each national history needs to be treated in its own terms.  But, as Passmore demonstrates, this would be somewhat too skeptical; there certainly were some large international and national forces that facilitated fascist mobilization and seizure of power in many different countries.The historical phenomena of fascism are interesting and important, because they represented powerful social forces (movements and governments that had great influence on events in the twentieth century). We would like for historical social science to have something substantive and illuminating to say about the causes and trajectory of fascism.  And, of course, we would be well advised to notice the warning signs if there are any!(Another excellent very short introduction from Oxford that is relevant to this topic is Helen Graham, The Spanish Civil War: A Very Short Introduction.)"}, {"title": "Social structures as causal factors", "date": "Tuesday, December 4, 2007", "text": "The continuing question here is this: how and through what mechanisms do various social entities exercise causal influence with respect to social outcomes?  (This will also be relevant to the question: how does power work in a given society?) We think the Gulf Stream wields influence with respect to weather and climate change, but not the circulation numbers of the NYT. And we can specify a lot of detail about the climate-system micro-mechanisms through which this influence is conveyed. We need comparable insight into social causation and various putative social causes or influences.In that spirit -- do social structures wield causal powers, and through what mechanisms do they do so?Let's take one specific example -- a mid-size social structure such as the higher-education system found in various countries. This is a complex of institutions, funding arrangements, internal practices and organizational forms. Can the higher-ed system be called a structure? And can it exercise causal influence on the society in which it is embedded?First, is it a social structure at all (as opposed perhaps to simply an agglomeration of miscellaneous lower-level institutions)? There is no doubt that this system is \"heterogeneous\" in the sense discussed in prior posts. There are many varieties of public universities, many types and strata of private universities, and many distinctive variations across individual universities. Moreover, these institutions are only somewhat loosely connected together. Nonetheless, British, Russian, French, Mexican, and US universities are different from each other, they have different institutions, values, and philosophies, and they serve in different ways to educate the post-high school populations of their countries. And these institutions have very important distributive consequences in their settings: the credential of baccalaureate gives the young graduate different opportunities than he or she would have otherwise. So it seems justified to describe these systems as \"structures\".The causal influence of the higher education system in a given country is fairly easy to address. The features of the higher education system in a country determine the skill level of the educated population and the \"culture\" of educated people. Schooling systems that favor technical and vocational education will have one sort of influence on economic development, different from a system that favors a broader \"general\" education. Systems that provide broad and affordable access across social classes have an effect on the inequalities that the society will embody in the future; and these effects are different from those of systems that are class-exclusive.  Universities are places where young people learn a lot of their political culture; so a system that embodies a culture of left-ism will have different political consequences than one that embodies quietism or consumerism.The causal mechanisms of these influences are also easy to discern: effects on individuals (skills and political values) leading to the creation of new economic and political opportunities for society in the next iteration. Other effects are a bit more subtle -- for example, the influence that universities have through creation of a variety of social networks (on Wall Street, in Washington, in the military or intelligence world).  In each case the causal powers of the institution are readily disaggregated into the microfoundations through which the institution shapes and constrains the individuals who pass theory the institution.And we can also reason on first principles (to be tested through comparative research) that different national complexes of institutions, practices, and values in higher education will make for observable differences in those societies' institutions, performance, and collective behavior. This is the central point of the new institutionalism: different institutional complexes doing the same social work will have different outcomes for behavior and the further development of institutions.So here is one medium-scale example that responds in the affirmative: concrete social structures do possess causal properties; these powers work through the features of constrained agency that they guide; and that we are likely to observe the different workings of these causal properties in different country settings.(I believe we could work out similar analysis for other social institutions, such as social-property systems, kinship systems, or systems of media ownership and control.)"}, {"title": "Power: social movements", "date": "Sunday, December 2, 2007", "text": "Social movements usually have to do with change rather than persistence. And they usually emerge from \"under-class\" groups who lack meaningful access to other official and institutionalized means of power. They are among the \"weapons of the weak\", and their effectiveness usually turns on the ability of a sub-population to mobilize in collective action with determination and courage. Examples include the American Civil Rights movement, the use of strikes and boycotts by coal miners in the Ruhr after World War I, and the Solidarity Movement in Poland in the 1970s.The question here is, what are the scope, limits, and mechanisms of social power wielded through social movements? Is it possible for a social movement to cause change in basic structures, policies, and distributions of wealth and power in society? (I am not thinking primarily here of revolutionary movements, but rather more prosaic struggles for improvement of some set of conditions for the under-group.)\u00a0The question arises because the terms of the problem essentially raise a social contradiction: a numerous but powerless group, advocating for a change of structure or distribution that harms the interests of the powerful, aligned against the most powerful forces in society. It would seem that this contest is inherently determined by the disproportion of powers held by the social actors. And yet we can provide memorable examples of success. So the question is, how does this work?\u00a0The first factor that provides an obvious source of potential power for the under-class group, is the size and functional role of the group in society. Several of the most obvious tactics for a social movement depend on this structural fact -- the strike, boycott, and mass demonstration. By mobilizing, the group can interfere with the smooth workings of society, compelling other parties to negotiate. And it can demonstrate its broad, mass-based support.\u00a0But the obstacles to these mass-based tactics are severe \u2013 classic collective action problems, problems of coordination and communication, and the need for competent organizations and leaders.  And the tactics available to the powerful (the state, police, mine owners) are imposing: repression and intimidation, divide and conquer, co-optation, control of media, and a greater ability to wait out the struggle.\u00a0Besides mass mobilization, there is the tactic of broadening the movement through alliances.  This strategy requires \"changing consciousness\" in the broader society by the actions of the under-class group. The group (primarily through its organizations and leaders) can strive to broaden the base of its movement through alliances with other like-minded groups and with the general public. And this depends upon successful communication -- setting the terms of the struggle in such a way that it aligns with the moral values and material interests of other groups.\u00a0Once again, the tactical options and advantages residing with the powerful are substantial. The powerful control the media; they have an advantage in setting the agenda; and they have an extensive ability to co-opt potential allies of the popular movement (side deals, special accommodations, playing off divisions within the mass population). But not all the face cards rest with the powerful.\u00a0So here we have several kinds of tactics for the social movement -- direct mass mobilization, broadening of alliances, and a deliberate campaign to capture the moral discourse for the public. But let's push forward and consider what comes next. Suppose there is a social constituency for an important structural change. Suppose this group is fairly strongly mobilized (in terms of the engagement of members), that it has competent organization and leadership, and that its members collectively play a significant role in the economy. Let us further suppose that the group has now engaged in all the tactics above -- large peaceful demonstrations in several cities, a few successful boycotts, and a successful communications campaign that has strengthened public support for the movement. Now what, in a constitutional democracy? (The analysis will look different within a dictatorship -- for example, the situation of labor unions in pre-war Nazi Germany).\u00a0It isn't implausible to conjecture that this scenario results in legislative action in support of the program. The public visibility and popularity of the struggle seem to lead to the inference that voters care about the issue, and legislators listen. So the social movement has won the day and has secured its objective. It has won the battle. But has it won the war -- is the change of policy a genuine and enduring change of structure in favor of the under-class?  And here we can speculate again: the long, slow \"tectonics\" of power and privilege will turn back these gains in the future. The popular coalition cannot sustain its vigilance and mobilization forever; whereas the interests and strategic advantages of the powerful persist like great tectonic plates.\u00a0So on this line of thought, we can come to a provisional assessment of the causal powers of social movements in democracies: they have a fighting chance of securing tactical victories, but the prospects for achieving enduring structural change seem more remote. Their ability to change the rules of the game in a sustainable way seems limited in the face of entrenched and enduring interests opposed to such a change.\u00a0(Perhaps the Civil Rights movement is the rare exception to this statement. The rules of the game have plainly changed since 1953 with respect to race relations in the US -- in spite of the pressing need for further transformation.)(There is of course a huge literature on social movements.

Both persistence and change require explanation in such entities.  Because there is a third alternative condition of such an entity: chaos, randomness, and Brownian motion of individuals in interaction with each other. Succinctly -- the current state of the ensemble is simply the sum of the states of the lower-level units, and their states are in turn determined by a stochastic set of encounters with other individuals in the prior period. Both persistence and patterned change are non-random outcomes for a compositional system, and each demands explanation.  (It is as if crystals formed periodically in boiling water among the micro-particles observed in the solution.)  So if we observe either persistence or patterned change in spite of underlying stochastic processes, there must be causes of these non-random outcomes; so we want to be able to discover the causes of both.To consider change and persistence, we need to answer a prior question: change and persistence of what? Logically, an ensemble demonstrates change and persistence with respect to some set of characteristics: features of organization, patterns of distribution of lower-level properties (e.g. income, attitudes), characteristics of \"meso\"-level behavior.  In biological terms, the ensemble possesses structures, functions, and dynamics of development. And we need to be able to explain each of these gross features in a way that is consistent with the compositional nature of social entities.We can easily produce examples of each type of condition in social life.Persistence: The Federal Reserve Board retains its institutional form and its functional role within the US economy over a 50-year period.  Baseball is still governed by the same basic rules as it was in the nineteenth-century (with minor variations).Change: American attitudes about race shift measurably over 50 years.  The percentage of workers in labor unions falls dramatically from 1970to 2000.Stochastic: The frequency of the name \"Harry\" falls dramatically from 1950 to 1990. Traffic on Skype fluctuates from minute to minute.Given that the ensemble is composed of lower-level elements (individuals), we want to know what it is that constrains, impels, and conditions the behavior of the individuals, such that the ensemble comes to have the observed features of persistence and change.In order to explain either persistence or change in social arrangements, what do we have to work with?  Only two sorts of things, fundamentally.  We have the behavioral characteristics of the individuals who constitute the society; and we have the behaviorally relevant features that are embodied in current social institutions and practices (rules, incentives, opportunities, forms of social cooperation and social punishment).  The latter \"social\" facts are themselves embodied in the behavioral characteristics of the persons who constitute them; but at any given time they function with apparent autonomy with respect to particular actors.Fundamentally, then, the explanation of both persistence and change in society requires that we uncover the features of individual motivation that guide their behavior (interests, values, preferences, identities, practices); the features of the current social environment that empower and limit individual strategies; and the processes of aggregation through which the individuals' actions come together into collective behavior in either reinforcing or disrupting the social facts of current interest. This intellectual model for social explanation is what I refer to as \"methodological localism.\"(See \"The Heterogeneous Social\" for more on methodological localism.)Wittgenstein's comments about the science of psychology have some resonance with the current state of the social sciences:\u201cThe confusion and barrenness of psychology is not to be explained by calling it a \u201cyoung science\u201d; its state is not comparable with that of physics, for instance, in its beginnings...  For in psychology there are experimental methods and conceptual confusion...  The existence of the experimental method makes us think we have the means of solving the problems which trouble us; though problem and method pass one another by\u201d (Ludwig Wittgenstein, Philosophical Investigations, 1968, II xiv, 232e).We need a philosophy of social science because the methods, concepts, and framing theories of the social sciences are not yet adequate. We haven't yet fully thought through what the central challenges of social inquiry are, and how to think about \"the social\" as a field of study."}, {"title": "Historical comparisons", "date": "Wednesday, November 28, 2007", "text": "Historians are sometimes interested in comparing two cases or events in order to discover something of historical importance -- common causal mechanisms, important institutional differences between the cases, or ways in which the cases illustrate some larger historical pattern.  For example, Kenneth Pomeranz offers an extensive comparison of European and Asian economic development in The Great Divergence: China, Europe, and the Making of the Modern World Economy. Other examples of historical comparisons might include the Russian Revolution and the Chinese Revolution; the build-out of railroads in Britain versus France; the collapse of the French Army in 1870 versus 1940; the colonial experience in Senegal versus Kenya; the development of London versus Tokyo; and many others.The question to be considered here is this: what standards or heuristics ought to govern the choice and definition of units of comparison?  Would it make sense to compare World War II with the war in Bosnia?  Or the scientific cultures of Bologna in 1400 with that of London in 1960? Or the Spanish Civil War with the culture clash of the United States in the 1960s? What factors make for a historically insightful comparison?Part of an answer is obvious at the start: there is no hard-and-fast answer to the question.  It is always possible that there is a basis of comparison across apparently radically dissimilar cases.  So the Spanish Civil War comparison with Madison SDS activism might seem to single out two cases that are too incommensurable to be valuable -- until a creative historian notices that each historical moment revealed deeply different political and moral worldviews and that these ideological differences led to substantial inter-group hostility and conflict in each case.  And this comparison might then lead this historian to ask the productive question: why did one instance result in years of warfare and the second resolved into peaceful protest?Further, it is evident that comparison depends upon the background set of questions that we want to answer; useful comparison is topic-dependent.    Comparing Bologna 1400 with London 1960 might be useful if we are investigating the cultural transmission of ideas but useless if we are investigating the causes of urban unrest.  And comparing Paris 2006 with Detroit 1967 might be valuable on the second topic but beside the point for the first.Historically insightful comparison also requires that we not be dazzled by the fact that similar language is used to describe or categorize multiple events.  The Chinese Revolution and the Russian Revolution might be described in very similar terms: revolutions resulting from the overthrow of a pre-modern state by a militant party of revolutionaries leading an emerging under-class population.  But this description is misleading on its face and in what it conceals.  These historical events were actually very different in their political composition, the role and behavior of parties, and the relations that existed among other social forces.  The Russian Revolution might be re-described as an opportunistic seizure of power by a minor political party, and the Chinese Revolution might be described as a long, slow mobilization of a mass population in support of revolutionary change.  Other descriptions are possible as well.  The point is that the common label of \"revolution\" should not mask the possibility or likelihood of extreme differences in processes, politics, parties, and mobilizations in the two instances.To get some guidance, we need first to reflect on what the goal of the comparison is.  And there are numerous goals that a historian might have.  For example --discover \"generalizations\" about similar processes. (\"Each of the revolutions studied contains \"state crisis\" as a causally necessary factor.\")identify concrete historical mechanisms that are at work in the cases -- whether or not they recur in other cases as well. (\"Political mobilization in the first case proceeds through pre-existing religious organizations on the ground; in the second case it proceeds through control of the national media.\")identify causally salient differences across cases that explain divergence of outcomes.  (Here the idea would be an argument something like this: cases A and B are similar in many ways. However, A leads to X, while B leads to Y.  What explains this divergence of outcome?)discover some of the substantial variety that exists underneath the surface in events that seem superficially similar.  (We might pursue this \"difference\" strategy in urban history and choose a set of examples that will illustrate the many ways in which the world's cities have evolved and are organized and governed.)Thus the selection of cases will depend on what the purpose of the comparison is.   But in general, the only reason to engage in comparison is the likelihood that we will learn something from the comparison that we would not have learned from study of one of the individual cases.All this said -- we might consider the heuristic that says that the cases need to be similar enough to permit comparison in terms of structures, processes, and causes; different enough to invite inquiry about the causes of the differences; and integrated enough to allow us to say that this level of unit of analysis possesses the complex set of historical characteristcs under study as a whole.Let's flesh this heuristic prescription out by considering one specific historical question: How did \"European economic development\" compare with \"Asian economic development\"? Before we can begin to try to answer this question, we need to give a more thoughtful definition of the units of comparison.  Should the comparison be between continents, between countries, between regions within countries, or between selected cities and villages?  Kenneth Pomeranz and others argue that continents and nations are too large to serve as a basis of valuable economic comparison, in a very specific sense: they encompass too much variety of social and economic processes to permit valid comparison.  Pomeranz argues instead that Eurasian comparison is most valid if we select integrated economic regions of roughly comparable size; large enough to encompass the range of economic, social, and political arrangements that plausibly influence economic development, but not so large that the scale obliterates distinctive patterns and outcomes.  Based on these sorts of considerations, he argues that it is most useful to consider a comparison between the core economic regions of England and the Lower Yangzi Delta in China.  (James Lee offers an even more disaggregated basis for comparison of demographic regimes; he argues for a comparison based on descriptions of populations at the community level, ignoring nations and large economic regions altogether; Life Under Pressure: Mortality and Living Standards in Europe and Asia, 1700-1900.)(See Eurasian Historical Comparisons for more on one aspect of this issue.)"}, {"title": "Is it an interesting sociological fact that \"urban people are better educated than rural people\"?", "date": "Tuesday, November 27, 2007", "text": "Let's suppose that this statement about urban-rural differences in educational levels summarizes census data by calculating the average number of years of formal schooling for people in cities and people in rural areas. Is this brute fact about two large populations a valid description of the two populations? Is it an important or illuminating sociological fact?There are several types of questions we need to ask about this fact. First, there are questions to address about the statistical features of the data themselves. How are these two populations distributed around the mean? How wide is the variance around the mean? Do we get a different result if we measure the median number of years of schooling as opposed to the mean? Which of these measures is a more meaningful description of the population as a whole -- median or mean?Consider a hypothetical set of results.  If the rural population is quite homogeneous around a mean of 10 years of schooling, while the urban population is widely distributed in a range from 5 years to 20 years, the fact that the urban mean is 11 years is somewhat misleading; the majority of urban people in this hypothetical case have less than 9 years (so urban is less well educated), while at the same time 20 percent of urban people have at least 14 years (so urban population is better educated). The point is this: the brute fact of a difference in the means is not particularly insightful in estimating the educational resources of the two populations.Second, there are important sociological questions about the internal differentiation of the population into groups with very different educational patterns. Do women and men show different profiles in the two large populations? How about members of ethnic or racial groups? How about groups identified by income, wealth, or home ownership? What about groups defined by whether a parent had attended college? Arriving at this set of questions requires sociological imagination. The investigator needs to consider what internal differentiations within the large population might affect the sub-group's educational characteristics.Finally there is the question of finding possible causal explanations of the differences that are discovered across major populations (urban and rural) and within sub-populations (ethnic, gender, or class-defined groups), and tracing out some of the ways in which these patterns in turn cause other social outcomes (future inequalities of income, for example). Those causal  mechanisms might be various: differences in the opportunities that are presented to members of different social groups (including the possibility of discrimination), differences in values and cultures, within families, differences in gender treatment, differences in religious traditions and practices, and differences in access to resources, to name a few.Now suppose we have done quite a bit of empirical, theoretical, and causal analysis along these lines. Suppose we have found that the internal structures of eduational attainment statistics are quite different between urban and rural populations; that the taxonomy of sub-groups is different; and that the causes and social mechanisms of the differences in attainment across the rural-urban divide are substantially different as well. What salience does the original brute fact continue to have (that the means are different in the two populations)?We might say that the brute fact is in fact a valid empirical observation; that it needs to be substantially further analyzed; and that the genuinely valuable and insightful sociological findings only emerge once we have further disaggregated the statistics across salient groups and have provided some hypotheses about the mechanisms that influence the educational attainment profiles of the various sub-groups. At that point we have some idea of the underlying sociology that produces the brute fact. But the brute fact itself is largely unilluminating."}, {"title": "Does historical materialism have a place in today's social sciences?", "date": "Sunday, November 25, 2007", "text": "Marx's theory of historical materialism came with a few central concepts, a large hypothesis, and a heuristic for social research.  The concepts include class, the forces and relations of production, the economic structure, the superstructure, and the idea of determination (\"in the last instance\", as Althusser and Poulantzas put it) between the economic structure and elements of the superstructure.  The heuristic is, \"Look to the circumstances of property and class -- the material circumstances of society -- in order to discover the causal relationships that exist in large social change across history.\"  The large hypothesis is that the historical dynamic created by tension between the forces of production (the level of technology and labor skills) and the relations of production (the property relations) creates a set of imperatives and constraints for social change that leads to the formation and transformation of other social elements, such as the state, morality, or culture.  Class and class conflict play a central role in mediating the effects of the economic structure on other aspects of society.Are these elements of historical materialism still of value to sociology and historical explanation?The concepts associated with the theory of historical materialism are legitimate macro-sociological tools for organizing and analyzing social institutions and structures within particular societies.  Their utility depends on the degree to which they permit the historian to identify and explain in detail the real social processes that are underway in the society under examination. There is no a priori basis for judging that this conceptual scheme is superior to other alternatives (as Marx sometimes seems to suggest).  Rather, we need to evaluate the materialist conceptual scheme through its fecundity in identifying causal mechanisms and processes within the empirical phenomena under study.The heuristic too remains insightful -- as long as we keep in mind the fact that historical change has many causes.  It is fair to say that material factors have historical influence -- levels of technology influence other social institutions such as the educational system, the property system creates a set of interests that have important political effects on mobilization, and struggle over the control of social wealth is plainly an important historical factor.  And it is a productive strategy for historians to examine in details the ways in which material circumstances produce other kinds of social change through the actions of historically situated actors.  Further, careful study of the material circumstances of a society shed important light on the circumstances of life for the almost invisible ordinary people.The master hypothesis of historical materialism is the least enduring.  Marx's reading of history within the lenses of historical materialism was simply too deterministic, too unidirectional, and too single-factored, to provide a credible basis for explaining historical change.  The difficulty with the hypothesis is its comprehensiveness and its suggestion that there is only one major historical dynamic.  But take any particular historical outcome of interest -- the dynamics leading to a rebellion in North China, for example.  Material conflicts of interest are likely enough to be part of the motivations of the participants, and the powers associated with various groups derivative from their control of wealth and property are plausibly related to the ability of various groups to play an influential role in the developing events.  However, there are plainly other social and causal factors that are unrelated to the property system -- for example, a history of drought or flooding in the region, the structure and tenacity of kinship systems, the nature of local morality and justice sensibilities, the degree of transportation interconnectedness of the region, and indefinitely many other factors.It is implausible, then, to suppose that a single factor -- whether material class circumstances, ideology, or other social characteristics -- is the sole important causal factor in large historical processes. Historical processes are contingent and conjunctural, so the effort to discover a single key to explain all large historical processes and outcomes is futile.  At the same time, it is plausible enough that the circumstances and institutions associated with technology and property have historical effects; and in fact, it is straightforward to describe the microfoundations through which these institutions interact with ordinary human behavior and choice to lead to social outcomes. This assessment suggests that historians and sociologists are well justified in including the concepts and heuristics of historical materialism in their tool kit, but that they would be well advised to reject the almost metaphysical certainty of the grand hypothesis.(See Gerald Cohen, Karl Marx's Theory of History, for an analytic philosopher's pathbreaking treatment of historical materialism.)Does social science require systems of classification?From Jorge Luis Borges' description of a fictional Chinese classification of animals:\u201cThese ambiguities, redundancies and deficiencies remind us of those which doctor Franz Kuhn attributes to a certain Chinese encyclopaedia entitled 'Celestial Empire of benevolent Knowledge'. In its remote pages it is written that the animals are divided into: (a) belonging to the emperor, (b) embalmed, (c) tame, (d) sucking pigs, (e) sirens, (f) fabulous, (g) stray dogs, (h) included in the present classification, (i) frenzied, (j) innumerable, (k) drawn with a very fine camelhair brush, (l) et cetera, (m) having just broken the water pitcher, (n) that from a long way off look like flies.\u201d Jorge Luis Borges, Other Inquisitions: 1937-1952   The lesson?  That a system of classification needs to rest upon a coherent, logical assessment of the causal and structural properties of the things being classified, so that the classification may lead us to a better understanding of the range of phenomena encompassed by the system.The social sciences consist of a variety of disciplines, subject areas, and methods, and there is no reason to expect that these disciplines will eventually add up to a single unified theory of society.  Political science, sociology, history, anthropology, economics, geography, and area studies all provide their own, largely independent, definitions of scope, research agenda, and research methods.  And there is no grand plan according to which the disciplinary definitions jointly capture all that is of scientific interest about the social.History rather than logic explains the particular configuration of social science disciplines that we now face.  The major social science disciplines have grown up in the past century and a half by creating stylized answers to these topic areas: the \u201cpolitical\u201d concerns institutions of coercion and governance; the \u201ceconomic\u201d has to do with production, exchange, and distribution of goods and services; the \u201canthropological\u201d has to do with the cultures, values, and practices through which individuals and groups conduct their local lives.  Area studies are defined according to a different axis; Asian studies or Latin American studies demand that we cut the social differently: not from the point of view of social domains, but from the point of view of geographical complexes of related social, cultural, economic, political, and normative regimes.At the same time, we as \u201cusers\u201d of the results of social inquiry have no inherent interest in the intra- and inter-disciplinary debates that have led to the constitution of the disciplines of the social sciences as they currently exist.  The social world does not come to us labeled as \u201cpolitical,\u201d \u201ceconomic,\u201d or \u201cethnographic.\u201d  We ordinary citizens have questions that cut across these boundaries recklessly: Why does the US state so commonly ignore the needs of poor people? Why are Indonesian rice farmers reluctant to make use of HYV rice strains?  Why did the hi-tech bubble occur in the American economy in the 1990s?  How do police departments succeed in recruiting good potential officers?  When is the practice of charitable giving most likely to thrive or falter?  Why did the Chinese Communist revolution occur?  Why did it succeed?  Note what a mixture of topics, human interactions, and methodologies is invoked by this collection of questions.  Some of these queries raise the question of why individuals behaved as they did; some focus on group action, while others single out individual choices; some have to do with the institutions within which individuals live; some suggest turning to ethnography, comparative economics, or political science; and so forth.The upshot is this: Users of the social sciences have a different way of parsing \u201cthe social\u201d than is found in academic social science.  We are interested in human agency and behavior \u2014 individual and collective.  We are interested in the ways social relations and institutions work, and how they affect the behavior and choices of the individuals who operate within them.  We are interested in how large agglomerations of human activity work \u2014 how they emerge, how they behave over time, and how they go wrong (cities, states, corporations, networks of friends, \u2026), and we are interested in the dynamics of face-to-face social interaction.This suggests that new thinking about the social sciences needs to start with the idea of acquiring a strong commitment to interdisciplinary study of common social topics.(Here are several other posts on \"social science disciplines\" (tag).)"}, {"title": "What kind of knowledge can philosophy offer?", "date": "Saturday, November 24, 2007", "text": "Let us say that knowledge is \"a set of true statements based on compelling reasons.\"  (This is the same as the familiar definition of knowledge as \"justified true belief\".) Philosophers offer a variety of claims, and they offer arguments for their positions.  But do they offer knowledge about anything?  Is it possible to say that \"Philosophical statement P is true\", or only that \"Philosophical statement P is supported by strong and compelling reasons\"?  Are philosophical topics within the domain of things concerning which we can have knowledge at all?We know what kind of knowledge empirical science provides: factual knowledge about the world and inferences or theories supported by empirical observation.   We also know what kind of knowledge is offered by mathematics and logic : deductive knowledge derived from a set of axioms in one or another of the fields of mathematics.  And we can specify the nature of the knowledge provided by linguistics and semantics: expository knowledge of the meanings of various words and phrases in ordinary usage.  Putting these areas of inquiry very crudely, we might summarize them as \"inductive knowledge,\" \"deductive knowledge,\" and \"semantic knowledge.\"  But what does philosophy add to our knowledge and understanding of human experience and knowledge?Notice that knowledge and truth are interrelated.  Truth, in turn, has to do with correspondence and reference.  Statements refer to things and properties; statements are true or false depending on whether the things to which the statement refers in fact possesses the properties attributed to it.  So a statement cannot be a piece of knowledge if it does not permit of correspondence to some independent set of facts.Now consider the kinds of reasoning and statements that occur within philosophy.First, philosophy offers assertions based on rigorous analysis of concepts and conceptual relationships.  This exercise looks a bit like the linguistics/ semantics option above; but philosophers offer \"value-added\" by providing  rational reconstruction of the concepts they consider.  They reconstruct and improve upon the concepts of everyday language.Second, philosophy may provide constructive analysis and further development of the methods and conceptual systems of various disciplines, including the empirical sciences.  Here the philosopher is purporting to offer substantial findings that will improve upon the epistemic characteristics of existing scientific practices.  Crudely, a deeper understanding of the logic of evolutionary explanation and the mathematics of natural selection is a philosophical effort, and it is a substantive contribution to the philosophy of biology and to biological theory.  Here, we must ask whether there is a credible basis for the contribution.  In what respect does the philosopher possess a distinctive basis for providing rational assessment and recommendations about the structure and practice of empirical science?  Typically, philosophers would respond by saying that philosophical argumentation about the methods of science gains credibility through the understanding of rationality and reasoning that philosophers possess.Third, philosophy can construct ethical theories that possess some degree of justification, beyond ordinary moral opinions.  When John Rawls asks, \"What is justice?\", he begins with some ordinary associations with the concept, but then builds out a theory of justice that goes far beyond ordinary language. And he offers a range of philosophical justifications in support of his theory of \"justice as fairness\".A major problem in answering the key question, what is the nature of philosophical knowledge, is the fact that we ordinarily divide knowledge into \"empirical/contingent\" and \"formal/necessary\" (or what Quine calls the \"analytic/synthetic\" distinction).  But philosophers seem to advance their theories in a way that implies they are neither empirical nor purely formal.  Kant puts this point in the form of a category of knowledge that is \"synthetic a priori\" -- that is, knowledge that is based on purely philosophical reasoning but that is nonetheless not purely formal.  (Kant's claim that the statement \"reality is spatially organized in Euclidean three-dimensional space\" is true synthetic a priori asserts that the statement is necessarily true but is not a truth of logic.)One possible stance that we might take is to restrict the concept of \"knowledge\" to statements about empirical states of affairs (where truth and falsity are possible), but to then postulate other categories of belief that have a degree of rational credibility without correspondence to the empirical world.  On this approach, empirical statements, suitably supported, can constitute knowledge of the empirical world. Philosophical statements -- statements about scientific method, the nature of beauty, or ethical principles -- can be offered with rational justification but do not have the referential structure that would permit them to be \"true\" and do not count as knowledge.  If we take this approach, then we may be justified in accepting the proposition \"Justice is fairness,\" but we would not be justified in thinking it is \"true.\"  And therefore the statement is not an example of \"knowledge\".This approach sounds a bit parallel to the position of early twentieth-century logical positivism, which maintained the verificationist theory of meaning -- the meaning of a sentence is the set of conditions that establish its truth or falsity -- with the result that theology, philosophy, or ethics are strictly speaking meaningless.  However, the two views are not the same, because this view permits that philosophical discourse is meaningful and rational; it simply denies that the statements that philosophers make either correspond or fail to correspond with facts about the world.The conclusion to this line of thought is somewhat startling: philosophy does not offer knowledge at all.  However, it does provide opinions and statements that are founded on good reasons, and we have rational grounds for believing these statements."}, {"title": "What is a social structure?", "date": "Thursday, November 22, 2007", "text": "Are there such things as \"social structures\"? In what do they consist? What sorts of social powers do they exercise? This is a question I considered in greater detail in New Contributions to the Philosophy of History and Varieties of Social Explanation. But it is worth taking up here as well.Here are a few books that have made useful contributions to the current understanding of the causal powers of social structures.Consider a few candidates for social structures: the global trading system, the Federal government, the Chinese peasantry of the 1930s, the English class system, the Indian marriage system, race in the United States, the city of Chicago. Are these items examples of \"social structures\"?What are the central assumptions we make in designating something as a social structure? (Note that the term \"social structure\" can be used in at least two important senses: first, as a causally operative institutional complex (the state or the market as causal social structures), and second, as a description of facets of the organization of society (demographic structure, urban-rural structure, structure of race and ethnicity, income structure). Here I will focus on the first sense of the term.)Several ideas appear to be core features in our ordinary understanding of this concept. A social structure consists of rules, institutions, and practices. A social structure is socially embodied in the actions, thoughts, beliefs, and durable dispositions of individual human beings. A social structure is effective in organizing behavior of large numbers of actors. A structure is coercive of individual and group behavior. A social structure assigns roles and powers to individual actors. A social structure often has distributive consequences for individuals and groups.  A social structure is geographically dispersed. Social structures can cause social outcomes involving both persistence and change.We might try to reduce these intuitions to a definition: a social structure is a system of geographically dispersed rules and practices that influence the actions and outcomes of large numbers of social actors.Now back to our original question: do such things exist? Before proceeding to a answer, a few points are evident. Any social entity must possess microfoundations in human mentalities and actions. There is no such thing as a social entity that lacks human embodiment--any more than there are works of art that lacks material embodiment. Social entities \"supervene\" upon human individuals.This point also applies to any statements we might make about the putative causal powers of a social entity. So claims about the causal properties of social structures must be supplemented by a theory of the microfoundations of those powers.  How does an extended social structure exert influence over the actions of located individuals?And there is a final parallel point about claims about the geographical scope and coherence of a social entity. If we want to maintain that an entity exercises influence as a coherent and extended entity, we need to be able to specify the mechanisms through which this takes place. How does the Federal state exert its control and influence over the vast scope of the United States and its population?So, with these qualifications about the unavoidable need for providing microfoundations--are there social structures?Several of the instances offered above fit the terms of our provisional definition.  They are large complexes of rules and practices that influence behavior and outcomes.  And it is straightforward to begin to provide a description of the microfoundations upon which they exist: the social components through which these structures are embodied and through which they exercise influence on individuals and groups.  The US Federal Government functions as a system of branches of government, each with its own departments governed by formal and informal rules.  And the \"reach\" of the state down to the local and individual level is secured by the socially implemented forms of power that are locally expressed (bank inspectors, law enforcement agencies, tax auditors, ...).This is an example of a large social structure that operates through a high degree of formal institutionalization. But some of the examples mentioned above depend primarily on informal mechanisms -- the workings of widespread beliefs and attitudes, along with a diffused willingness of individuals to \"enforce\" the requirements of the structure.  Structures relying primarily on informal mechanisms include the Indian marriage system or the English class system.Is \"race\" a structure in American society?  Plainly it possesses some of the key elements identified above.  The reality of race leads to an uneven distribution of opportunities and outcomes, so \"race\" is a social fact with distributive consequences.  It has the element of coercion: racial prejudice and patterns of discrimination are imposed on individuals without an \"opt-out\" possibility.  And we can identify many of the social mechanisms through which race and racial discrimination work; so the category possesses microfoundations. Today many of those mechanisms are \"informal\" rather than \"formal\"; but of course the legal institutionalization of racial discrimination is a recent fact in American history.  So \"race\" is a structural feature of American society. Several of the examples mentioned above appear to fall outside the category of social structure, however; for example, \"Chinese peasantry\".  These examples appear to be large factors that play a role in large social structures, but are more akin to elements than systems.  So the structure that defines \"Chinese peasantry\" is the system of property, agriculture, and kinship that defines the peasant's role and opportunities in society; the category of \"peasant\" identifies one node within that system or structure. What about \"the city of Chicago\"? Is this a structure or some other category of social entity?  I am inclined to say that the city of Chicago is a complex social entity, not a structure.  It falls within a variety of structures in America and the world--the global trading system, the electoral process, and the politics of national funding for large cities; and it embodies within it a variety of smaller structures--the public school system, lending practices, nepotism.  But the city itself does not function as a regulative system coordinating the activities of large numbers of individuals.  Rather, it is a complex social entity composed of a mix of social practices, behaviors, systems, and relationships.There are quite a few posts in the UnderstandingSociety blog on the topic of structures and agents; follow the structure label to find more.Rational choice theory is a mid-level theory of human agency, intended to capture core features of human decision-making in order to provide a basis for abstract and generalized theories of the dynamics of various areas of social behavior.  The disciplines of political science and economics make particularly extensive use of versions of rational choice theory (decision theory, expected utility theory, game theory, theories of parametric and strategic rationality) in designing theories and models of stylized circumstances of social action (e.g. market decision-making, production decisions, voting decisions, collective action decisions).   Homo economicus -- the rationally self-interested preference- or utility-maximizing individual --  stands at the foundation of typical models in economics and political science.The theory of economic rationality can be specified in numerous ways.  In all its versions it is an abstraction from real human behavior, in two senses.   The theory abstracts from idiosyncratic differences in reasoning across individuals; and it abstracts from other, perhaps systematic, factors that might influence reasoning (emotions and morals, for example).  The theory allows for differences across individuals, of course, but primarily in the individual's preferences or utility function.  (The nature of the decision rule is also a variable: more risk averse or less, optimizing or satisficing, maximin or maximize expected utility).The question here is, what role does rational choice theory play in social explanations and in formal models in political science and economics, and how does it function in description of individual psychology and behavior?Some formalistic economists and political scientists treat the assumptions of rational choice theory as purely formal axioms that can provide the basis for a mathematical treatment of a stylized problem -- solution to an n-person non-zero sum game, for example.  These theorists are not concerned about the descriptive adequacy of the axioms, but rather the feasibility of employing the axioms to derive a solution to the problem.This approach is unsatisfying, however, if we think that the results of formal economic or political analysis are supposed to be explanatory in some sense of actual social phenomena.  Suppose we explain the low level of public contribution to public radio, by saying that the \"contribution/non-contribution\" game is an n-person prisoners' dilemma, and the mathematical solution to such a game demonstrates an equilibrium of low contribution.  This mathematical finding is only potentially explanatory if we have some reason to think that the model bears a relevant relationship to the system of behavior it is modeling; the model assumes rationally self-interested maximizers; so the model is potentially explanatory of the public radio result only if the listeners are to some degree approximately well-described as \"rationally self-interested maximizers.\"  In other words, the rational-choice explanation of this real social situation appears to require that there be some degree of realism in the assumption of individual rationality. The purely formalistic interpretation of the axioms would render the account devoid of explanatory value.This suggests a different approach to the question. It suggests that we should regard the assumption of rationality as an approximately true description of most human beings.  Rational choice theory is an empirical theory of human behavior, at a high level of abstraction.   \"Abstract\" in this context means \"disregarding of interfering or contrary factors\" -- as the theory of ideal gases is abstract in its disregard of intermolecular forces.  In other words, the theory of rationality might be construed as a particularly abstract part of an empirical theory of human psychology.If we take this approach, then we are naturally invited to test and improve upon this theory of human decision-making.  Are there other factors of deliberation and action that need to be introduced?  Are there differences across human groups and cultures with respect to the system of reasoning that individuals employ in practical decisions?  Is the theory of maximizing rationality true of at least a certain range of individuals and decision-making problems?  (Perhaps, for example, we are maximizing decision-makers when it comes to choosing a loaf of bread, but are influenced by emotions and commitments when it comes to choosing a political party to support.)The advantage of a simple, abstract theory of deliberation (the theory of economic rationality) is that it provides a mathematically tractable way of modeling certain common situations of social action.  If we advance a theory of deliberation and agency that postulates more nuance at the individual level and more variation across individuals and cultures, we may lose the ability to put forward models that result in equilibrium.  More empirical adequacy may reduce the theoretical or deductive adequacy of the disciplines.  However, it seems unavoidable that social science is better served by a theory of human agency and deliberation that is somewhat more faithful to actual human practical cognition.  And it would remain possible that the narrow assumptions of economic rationality emerge as being adequately descriptive in certain well defined problem circumstances (the circumstances of anonymous markets, for example).  Finally, it may be that other methods of aggregating from individual-level assumptions to models of collective behavior are feasible -- for example, the agent-based models that are advocated by the Santa Fe Institute.There may be one additional reason why rational choice theory asserts a centrality that separates it from the rest of social psychology -- that is the role that rationality plays in a normative sense.  We might think that reason and rationality are especially important human creations, and that it is valuable to have a theory of pure rationality (and its implications) even if the typical human reasoner falls far short of its assumptions.Rational choice theory is a powerful foundation for thinking about social behavior (at least in its moderate versions).  People have beliefs and goals; they survey the environment of choice and they arrive at actions that are intelligently related to the achievement of their goals.However, as an exclusive, abstract description of human behavior, rational choice theory confronts a few major problems.  A minor problem is the fact that people do not always act deliberatively.  They may act out of impulse, habit, or example -- without devoting the thought processes to their current choices that would be necessary in order to formulate a rational plan in the circumstances.  This is a minor problem, because this behavior itself may be rational in the \"satisficing\" sense: the stakes may be so low that it doesn't make sense to commit time and energy to the task of calculating what the best overall solution to the problem is.  (Shall I take the triple cappuccino or the iced mocha today?)More challenging is a much more substantial fact about human action and choice: there is a powerful set of psychological imperatives and constraints that make certain choices psychologically impossible even when they are \"goal-maximizing\".  Take food and clothing choices as examples: the fact that fish heads are perfectly nutritious and cheap will never induce most Americans to order them on the menu.  The fact that a pair of Bermuda shorts is a perfectly suitable attire in some settings will not induce someone to wear them to a black tie gala in place of the tuxedo.  It is as if the decision-making system is loaded with constraints of taste, preference, aversion, and norm that make some decisions simply impossible.This fact might be described as the workings of \"culture\"; it might be categorized under the heading of \"norms and values\"; or it might be assigned to the \"workings of personality and affect.\"  But whatever description we offer, it is plainly a factor that needs to be incorporated into a full theory of human agency and choice.It is not particularly difficult to model a \"decision-making system\" that incorporates the workings of tastes, aversions, and norms as well as goal-directed rationality.  The more challenging task lies at the level of psychological theories of individual development (how does the individual acquire and incorporate these cultural and normative constraints?) and sociological theories of transmission of these sorts of constraints.  What are the institutional and cultural mechanisms through which a system of tastes, aversions, and norms are transmitted throughout a group or population?And, finally, there is the task for behavioral science of incorporating the empirical findings that this set of observations permits concerning the ways in which real agents process experience and arrive at decisions, into aggregate models of collective behavior.  How should the abstract models of rational choice theory be extended to include these factors of affect, taste, and aversion?  Are these non-rational factors so idiosyncratic that they cannot be incorporated into behavioral science?  Or are there regularities at the level of individuals that permit aggregate consequences at the level of group behavior?  (And is it possible that we have arrived here at the theoretical nexus of \"marketing science\" -- the discipline aimed most directly at understanding and controlling the behavior of groups of consumers?)(An interesting edited volume by Lupia, McCubbins and Popkin explores some of these issues: Elements of Reason: Cognition, Choice, and the Bounds of Rationality .)"}, {"title": "Basis for the social science disciplines", "date": "Wednesday, November 21, 2007", "text": "Is there a reason or rationale underlying the scope and methods of the social science disciplines? Or is the current division of the subject matter arbitrary and contingent on accidents in the history of thought (as perhaps Michel Foucault believes in The Archeology of Knowledge and The Discourse on Language)?There are abbreviated definitions of the subject matters of sociology, political science, of economics -- \"Sociology is the study of groups and norms,\" \"political science is the study of the institutions and behavior through which political decisions are made,\" \"economics is the study of rational behavior in the context of scarcity\". And likewise for the core methods of inquiry and explanation. But the questions remain: Is this a logical way of covering the domain of possible inquiry?Are there areas of phenomena that are overlooked in this taxonomy? And pragmatically--is this combination of topics, scopes, and methods likely to solve the problems of explanation and policy to which we would like the social sciences to contribute?It is worth noticing in this discussion that each of the core disciplines of the social sciences is actually an umbrella encompassing a wide range of sub-disciplines, and these sub-disciplines themselves show significant variation in assumptions about subject matter, ontology, and methodology.  Within political science, for example, there are wide rifts between new institutionalists, rational choice theorists, comparativists, area specialists, and American politics  specialists, and there is no common perspective that gives substantial coherence across these divides.  Similar observations are true of economics, anthropology, and sociology as well.So how should we begin to analyze the status and adequacy of the current definitions of the social science disciplines?What would we want from a division of the disciplines in a large field of study (biology, physics, social science, psychology)?  This is an epistemic question: we want to know how best to go about acquiring knowledge about a broad domain of phenomena.  We would want to be sure that the most fundamental processes and the most practically important phenomena are given close scrutiny.  We would want to be sure that there are a variety of methods of inquiry that are well designed and effective in probing the nature of the phenomena under study.  And, of course, we would want the disciplines to be organized in such a way that practitioners are motivated and evaluated towards valid discovery.  Finally, it would appear logical that we would want there to be mechanisms of scientific communication through which discoveries and insights in one discipline may inform or deepen the discoveries of other neighboring disciplines.This last point deserves emphasis.  Disciplines provide focus; they encourage researchers to dig deeply into the specialized problems and methods that have been defined by the discipline.  But it is also true that specialization creates tunnel vision -- with the result that scientific understanding of a complex phenomenon may miss essential parts of the process because they overlap disciplinary definitions of subject matter.  So a logical expectation of the organization of scientific knowledge would presumably include a process through which interdisciplinary sharing is encouraged and facilitated.It needs also to be noted that it is entirely possible for a discipline to be mis-conceived.  The founders may have taken a wrong turn in highlighting what appeared to be the most important phenomena and mechanisms; the discipline may have adopted methodological commitments that were fashionable at a time but poorly fitted to the research problems of the subject matter (extreme behaviorism in psychology, for example); the disciplinary institutions (journals, universities) may have designed procedures of peer review that were discouraging to genuine progress in the discipline's ability to gain knowledge about the subject matter.There are many threads that this subject opens. But a few preliminary observations are justified.  First, it is worth observing that the social world does not come to us with a prior division of phenomena into \"economic,\" \"ethnographic,\" or \"sociological.\"  So the social world itself does not dictate the way in which we parcel out research problems across specialists.  Almost all social phenomena have dimensions of each of these characteristics, and the methods of each of these disciplines are relevant to inquiry and explanation of a single phenomenon.  So the insistence on using only the methods of one's discipline in analyzing a complex social phenomenon is a problem--along the lines of the saying that \"to a person with a hammer, everything looks like a nail\".  Second, it is noteworthy that each of the major social science disciplines has undergone harsh \"methodology wars\" in the past several decades--between rational choice theory and more empirical research in political science, between quantitative and qualitative researchers in sociology, or between interpretive and materialist ethnography methods.  Are these disputes productive of further discovery into the workings of the social world?  It is not evident that they are.  And third, the points made above about the general utility of interdisciplinary communication and collaboration seem especially applicable to the social sciences.  Given the inherently complex and mixed nature of social phenomena, surely the social sciences would benefit from a greater degree of interdisciplinarity and mutual respect.  Pluralism in theory and method would seem to best serve the goals of the social sciences.(See Andrew Abbott, Chaos of Disciplines, for a lively and illuminating examination of the social science disciplines.)"}, {"title": "Are social facts reducible to something?", "date": "Wednesday, November 21, 2007", "text": "What is the relationship between facts about society and facts about individuals?Reducibility means that the statements of one scientific discipline should be logically deducible from the truths of some other \"more fundamental\" discipline. It is sometimes maintained that the truths of chemistry ought in principle be derivable from those of quantum mechanics. A field of knowledge that is not reducible to another field R is said to be \"autonomous with respect to R\".  Philosophers sometimes further distinguish \"law-to-law\" reduction, \"type-to-type\" reduction, \"law-to-singular-fact\" reduction, and \"type-to-token\" reduction.Are social sciences such as economics, sociology, or political science reducible in principle to some other more fundamental field--perhaps psychology, neurophysiology, or the theory of rationality?To begin to answer this question we must first decide what items might be reduced: statements, truths, laws, facts, categories, or generalizations. Second, we need to distinguish several reasons for failure of reduction: failure in principle, because events, types, and laws at the social level are simply not fixed by states of affairs at \"lower\" levels, and failure for reasons of limits on computation. (The motions of a five-body system of stars might be determined by the laws of gravitation even though it is practically possible to perform the calculations necessary to determine future states of the system.)So now we can consider the question of social reduction in a reasonably clear form. Consider first the \"facts\" that pertain to a domain of phenomena--whether these facts are known or not.  (I choose not to concentrate on laws or generalizations, because I am doubtful about the availability of strong laws of social phenomena.) Do the facts of a hypothetically complete theory of human psychology \"fix in principle\" the facts of economics or sociology, given appropriate information about boundary conditions?One important approach to this problem is the theory of supervenience (Jaegwon Kim, Physicalism, or Something Near Enough).  A level of description is said to supervene upon another level just in case there can be no differences of state at the first level without there being a difference of state in the second level.  The theory is first applied to mental states and states of neurophysiology: \"no differences in mental states without some difference in neurophysiology states.\" Supervenience theory implies an answer to the question of whether one set of facts \"fixes in principle\" the second set of facts.  (It has been taken as obviously true that social facts supervene upon facts about individuals; how could it be otherwise?  What other constitutive or causal factors might influence social facts, beyond the actions and ideas of individuals?)  If the facts about social life supervene upon facts about the psychological states of individuals, then it follows that the totality of facts about individual psychology fixes in principle the totality of facts about social life.  (Otherwise there would be the situation that there are two total social worlds corresponding to one total \"individual psychology\" world; so there would be a difference at the social level without a difference at the level of individual psychology.)So this provides the beginnings of an answer to our question: if we believe that social facts supervene upon facts about individuals, then we are forced to accept that the totality of facts about individuals \"fix\" the facts about society.However, supervenience does not imply \"reducibility in principle\", let alone \"reducibility in practice\" between levels.  In order to have reducibility, it is necessary to have a system of statements describing features of the  lower level which are sufficient to permit deductive derivation (or perhaps probabilistic inference) of all of the true statements contained in the higher-level domain.  If it is a social fact that \"collective action tends to fail when groups are large\", then there would need to be set of statements at the level of individual psychology that logically entail this statement.  Two additional logical features would appear to be required for reduction: a satisfactory set of bridge statements (linking the social term to some construction of individual-level terms; \"collective action\" to some set of features of individual agents, so there is a mapping of concepts and ontologies between the two domains), and at least some statements at the lower level that have the form of general laws or law-like probabilistic statements.  (If there are no general statements at the lower level, then deductive inference will be limited to truth-functional deduction.)Now it is time for a speculative leap: a judgment call on the question of whether we ought to look for reductive links between social facts and individual-level facts.  My intuition is that it is not scientifically useful to do so, for several reasons.  First is the point about computational limits: even if the outcome of a riot is \"fixed\" by the full psychological states of participants ex ante and their strategic interactions during the event--it is obviously impossible to gather that knowledge and aggregate it into a full and detailed model of the event.  So deriving a description of the outcome from a huge set of facts about the participants is unpromising.  Second, it is telling that we need to refer to the strategic interactions of participants in order to model the social event; this means that the social event has a dynamic internal structure that is sensitive to sub-events that occur along the way.  (Jones negotiates with Smith more effectively than Brown negotiates with Black.  The successful and failed negotiations make a difference in the outcome but are unpredictable and contingent.)  Third, the facts at the social level rarely aggregate to simple laws or regularities that might have been derived from lower-level laws and regularities; instead, social outcomes are contingent and varied.So for a variety of reasons, it is reasonable to take the view that social facts supervene upon facts about individuals, but that social explanations are autonomous from laws of psychology.  (This final point might be paraphrased as \"the laws of psychology underdetermine social outcomes.\")Transportation systems function to move people, goods, and ideas.  Rail systems, road networks, airline systems, and water transport provide links between places that permit more reliable and low-cost movement of people and goods from point to point than previously available.  The history of transportation is simultaneously a history of technology change, population movement, colonialism, economic growth, business development, and the spread of disease.Transportation systems are particularly interesting when we consider their capacity for conveying social causation.  Consider these examples of causal relations mediated by transportation systems:Extension of a rail network stimulates the growth of new towns, villages and cities in North America in the 1880s.Establishment of a direct air travel link between A and B causes the more rapid spread of disease between these locations.Breakdown of the administration of the rail system leads to logistics bottlenecks and military defeat of the French army in the Franco-Prussian War.Regular river travel throughout the Canton Delta in China leads to the rapid spread of revolutionary ideas during the Republican Revolution, as travelers and merchants move easily from place to place.Commodity price correlation increases between Chicago and New York as a result of regular and cheap rail transport between these two cities.New business institutions (grain futures markets and grain elevators) are created to take advantage of cheap regular rail transport (Nature's Metropolis: Chicago and the Great West).Examples can be multiplied. But the central point is that transportation is a robust causal mechanism that mediates many important social processes and outcomes.  And its causal effectiveness is fairly transparent: new transportation opportunities create new options for social actors, who take advantage of these opportunities in choosing a place to live and work, in pursuing political goals, in moving armies, and in generating income.  So transportation is a causal mechanism whose microfoundations are especially visible, and whose causal consequences are often very large.(See \"Transportation as a Large Causal Factor\" for more on this subject.)"}, {"title": "Varieties of social causation", "date": "Monday, November 19, 2007", "text": "What are some chief mechanisms through which social behavior is shaped and social outcomes are caused? Ideally the best answer to this question would result from a survey or inventory of many explanations.  But consider some high level possibilities that could serve as a causal mechanism bringing about a social phenomenon of interest.Selection mechanisms. Why are passengers on commercial aircraft better educated than the general population? Because most airline passengers are business travelers, and high-level and mid-level business employees tend to have a higher level of education than the general population.Evolutionary explanations. Why does the level of firm efficiency tend to rise over time? Because the net efficiency of a firm is the product of many small factors.  These small factors sometimes change, with an effect on the efficiency of the firm.  Low efficiency firms tend ultimately to lose market share and decline into bankruptcy.  Surviving firms will have features that produce higher efficiency.Imitation mechanisms.  Why did the no-huddle offense become so common in the NFL in the 1980s? Because it was successful for a few teams, and others copied the offense in the hope that they too would win more games.Rational-intentional explanations. Why do rebellions often fizzle out? Because participants are rational agents with private goals, and they make calculating decisions about participation.Aggregative explanations (aggregate consequences of individual-level strategies).  Why does technological innovation occur continuously within a market-based society? Because manufacturers are constantly looking for lower-cost and higher-value-added methods of manufacturing, and this search leads them to innovations in products and technologies.Conspiracy explanations (covert strategems of the powerful).  Why did the United States move away from passenger railroads as the primary form of intercity transportation? Because powerful interests took political actions to assure that private automobiles would be encouraged as the primary form of transport.Mentality explanations (behavior is changed by changing beliefs and attitudes).  Why were so many Quaker men conscientious objectors at great personal cost during World War II? Because their religious beliefs categorically rejected the violence in war and they refused to participate in this immoral activity.Historical / path-dependency explanations. Why do we still use the very inefficient QWERTY keyboard arrangement that was devised in 1874? Because this arrangement, designed to keep typists from typing faster than the mechanical keyboard would permit, was so deeply embodied in the typing skills of a large population and the existing typewriter inventory by 1940 that no other keyboard arrangement could be introduced without incurring massive marketing and training costs.What is involved in providing a scientific study of society--a scientific sociology?Several features of science are crucial. Scientific claims are intended to be true and rationally supportable. Scientific knowledge is based on empirical research and rigorous reasoning. Science provides a basis for explaining the phenomena it considers. And science depends upon the idea of critical research communities: peers and collaborators who challenge, test, evaluate, and extend a set of results. In addition to these core features, positivist philosophers have added a few features drawn from the experience of the natural sciences. These observers hold that science involves the discovery of strong generalizations and laws that describe and govern empirical phenomena; that explanation means subsumption under some of these laws; and that natural phenomena constitute a law-governed, interconnected system.Positivism is a poor theory of the social sciences, because the  phenomena of social life do not conform to the law-governed ontology stipulated for natural phenomena. But let us stick with the minimal set of features and consider what kind of science is possible for social life.First, sociology involves description. Social phenomena are observable, and it is straightforward to design rigorous research efforts aimed at establishing the facts about a particular domain. This aspect of sociology involves rigorous empirical study of social phenomena. Examples of descriptive research include ethnographic research and micro-sociology along the lines of the Chicago School. But large-scale description is feasible as well, including empirical description of large social patterns and institutions.Descriptive findings often take the form of statistical estimates of the frequency of a feature within a group--for example, rates of suicide among Protestants (Durkheim).  Properties may be correlated with one another within a given population; variation in one variable may be associated with variation in another variable.  Descriptive research can thus sometimes reveal patterns of behavior or social outcomes--for example, patterns of habitation and health status.  And patterns such as these invite efforts to find causal relationships among the characteristics enumerated.  Second, sociology involves discovery of social causation and mechanisms. Is there such a thing as social causation? What does social causation derive from? What is the ontology of \"social necessity\" (analogous to natural necessity)--the way in which one set of circumstances \"brings about\" another set of outcomes?  In general we can begin with an ontology grounded in purposive social action by agents within institutional settings and environments. Social causation derives from the patterns of behavior that are produced in this setting. (For example, we can explain the degradation of environmental quality of a common resource as the consequence of free-riding behavior.)Third, sociology can provide explanations of some social outcomes as a causal consequence of proposed social mechanisms.  Once we have a generic idea of what social causal mechanisms look like, we can turn to specifics and try to discover the processes through which behavioris created and constrained. So we can try to discover or hypothesize the mechanisms through which tropical agriculture tends to under-serve farmers (Bates). Social theories are hypotheses about social causal mechanisms; so theories provide a basis for explanation of social phenomena.Research and explanation along these lines creates major and visible limitations on the degree of systematicity, interconnection, and determination that sould be expected of social phenomena. The social world is highly contingent, the product of many independent actors. So we should only expect a weak degree of systematic variation among social phenomena.Finally, the epistemic setting provided by the disciplinary institutions offers a basis for estimating the rational credibility of social science knowledge: journals, peer review, tenure evaluation. Social research and explanation remains fairly close to the level of the facts.  Researchers in the disciplines and sub-disciplines are charged to test and explore the empirical and theoretical claims of their peers.The results of a science including these components will be empirically disciplined, theoretically eclectic, and systemically modest. The goal of providing an over-arching theory that demonstrates the systematic integration of the social is abandoned.(It is worth noting that there is a period in the history of sociology when the epistemic values of the discipline were most consistent with this view. That was the period of the Chicago School. See Andrew Abbott's Department and Discipline: Chicago Sociology at One Hundred).The French Revolution began in 1789. It was caused by conflict between the aristocracy and the monarchy. Eventually it developed into violent conflict in every region of France. It created more lasting change in French society than did the Russian Revolution.These statements purport to refer to an extended but unified historical thing, the French Revolution. This thing is assigned a place within a causal system, being caused by one set of factors and having causal consequences for other factors. It is considered a suitable topic for comparison with other such things (the Russian Revolution).But what does the historical reality of the French Revolution consist in? Notice, to begin, that the revolution comprises a huge constellation of events and actions, both small and large.  Were any of these events \"the definitive moment\" in the revolution--the decisive event that constituted the constellation as a revolution rather than a \"period of unrest\"? Is it possible to distinguish clearly between core events and peripheral, minor events--not to speak of events that are wholly unrelated to the revolution? Most radically, would it be possible to construct the events of 1789 in such a way that no revolution occurred at all?One possible answer to these questions is to reply that the events directly associated with the overthrow of the monarchy and the establishment of a different form of political power constituted the essence of the revolution.  But what if later historians were to conclude that the transfer of power was illusory, and that the same interests in society continued to govern? In fact, if the monarchy had been restored in 1830 we might reasonably say that \"no revolution occurred, only an interruption of monarchy.\" Would either of these possibilities represent a refiguring of the historical picture in which the seizure of power is minor and background rather than major and foreground? And would this not be a basis for doubting that \"a revolution occrred in 1789\"?It seems best to understand \"the French Revolution\" as an intellectual construction--one possible way of knitting together the congeries of events that occurred during this time in France. Some constructions of these facts are more plausible than others, so it is possible to have rational dispute about the alternative construals of the constellation of events. But there is no essential fact of the matter that a revolution occurred in France in 1789. This doesn't derogate the status or facticity of the constituent events. But it does assert that the historian's act of composing events and actions into a large historical structure is an act of construction rather than recognition."}, {"title": "The heterogeneous social: institutions", "date": "Sunday, November 18, 2007", "text": "Populations and groups are inherently diverse; virtually any property that might be attached to an individual shows variance across the group.  So we have to pay special attention to specifying what we mean when we ask for a \"measurement\" of a property of a group.  This is the basic ontological fact that undergirds a critical approach to quantitative social and behavioral science.  And it means that we need always to be considering the variance within the group with respect to the property, the shape of the distribution, as well as the mean value of the property.It turns out that social phenomena are heterogeneous at the level of institutions, mentalities, practices, and causes as well. Later posts will consider other forms of social heterogeneity.  The topic here is institutional heterogeneity.  An institution is a system of rules through which a set of social behaviors are mediated.  Rules may be enforced through clear third-party enforcement powers (formal institutions) or diffuse participant enforcement practices (informal institutions).  Examples of institutions include contract law (formal), cooperative labor-sharing (informal), marriage systems (formal and informal), and tenure systems (formal).  Institutions are embodied in the beliefs, values, attitudes, and motivations of socially constructed individuals at various levels of action; they act to constrain and incentivize individual behavior in ways that are to some extent independent of the actions and preferences of those individuals.  (That is, the individual is rarely in a position to directly change the rules of the institution so as to serve his/her goals better.)  So institutions are both  caused by (embodied in) the social consciousness of an extended set of social actors, and are causal in shaping the future behavior of an extended set of social actors.Institutions have origins -- they come into being at a time and place.  So we can ask the question, \"what explains the fact of the emergence of the institution and the particular characteristics it possesses at that point?\"  And institutions undergo processes of development over time -- they undergo change in some characteristics, incorporate new scope and function, and gain new coalitions of supporters and opponents.  So we can ask the question, \"what factors explain the processes of change that the institution undergoes?\"  (Kathleen Thelen's How Institutions Evolve: The Political Economy of Skills in Germany, Britain, the United States, and Japan provides a very good account of the ways in which we need to investigate the origins and development of various important social institutions.)Institutions are sometimes grouped together into broad categories or classes in terms of social function (what does the institution do?), observable characteristics (what does the institution look like?), and social functioning (how does the institution work?).  So, for example, we might want to study institutions of marriage-partner selection, irrigation management, or institutions that regulate common property resources such as forests or wetlands; Governing the Commons: The Evolution of Institutions for Collective Action. In each case the group of institutions is defined in terms of the common social problem that they solve.Now we can frame the task of one important area of sociology and political science research: to undertake careful comparative research concerning the instances of institutions included within a category.  In what ways are different examples similar and different from each other? How have parallel or divergent institutional complexes emerged to solve broadly similar social problems?  What causal processes can be observed in the workings of these several examples?  How do these institutional matrices influence and constrain the forms of behavior that flow through them?  (So, in the book by Kathleen Thelen mentioned above, the author considers the national-level institutions of skilled-labor training that have evolved in Germany, UK, USA, and Japan; she considers the effects that these different regimes have on the flow of skilled workers; and she analyzes the political coalitions that were relevant in establishing a particular configuration of the institution.)Here, finally, we can address the issue of institutional heterogeneity.  Given the ways that institutions are formed, changed, and embodied, we should expect that there will be two forms of diversity among institutions.  First, it is clear that there are normally multiple ways of solving a particular social problem (training workers for industry, managing prisoners, administering social welfare subsidies).  So we should expect that there will be a range of institutional matrices that have emerged across societies to handle these challenges, and we can learn quite a bit about social causation by examining these differences and how they work.  And second, given that institutions are \"malleable\" and dynamic, we should expect that institutions will show diversity within their own life courses.  As powerful agents and coalitions shift in their powers and needs, as other constituents acquire more or less influence in setting the agenda for the institution, we should expect an ongoing process of modification of the institution over time."}, {"title": "The heterogeneous social: groups", "date": "Saturday, November 17, 2007", "text": "A social whole -- the city of Chicago, for example -- is a densely various empirical reality. At virtually every level of scale there is variance with respect to social characteristics -- income, health status, ethnic or social identity, political adherence and preference, age, race, or occupation. Neighborhoods differ from each other -- but equally, we find variance within neighborhoods as well.Given this fact of radical non-homogeneity of social characteristics, what is involved in arriving at knowledge about such a reality?It is evident that we are forced to arrive at generalized descriptions, at some level of scale or granularity.  It is neither feasible nor explanatory to provide a \"fully\" detailed description of a population, individual by individual. Instead, our challenge is to arrive at some ways of segmenting the population into groups that will prove felicitous in revealing causal connections among attributes or circumstances.  Groups may be defined with unlimited range: geographically, occupationally, racially or ethnically, educationally, politically, ...  We can then observe and measure the distribution and means of various characteristics across these groups (attitudes towards the Patriot Act, for example) and we can consider whether there are meaningful differences across groups with respect to these characteristics. Finally, we can try to find causal explanations of these differences. Are Arab-Americans more distrustful of national security laws than Asian-Americans? Are poor people more prone to asthma than affluent people? Are doctors more favorable to higher taxes than skilled-trades workers? What factors might causally explain these differences?The point here is that social knowledge requires recognition of the inherent heterogeneity of social phenomena and a fertile effort to find ways of segmenting this heterogeneous reality that shed light on social causation and patterns of behavior. And, importantly, it is important to recognize that any level of granularity of analysis could be further partitioned and more fully described--sometimes with important insight.There is no \"fundamental\" or \"optimal\" level of analysis and description that captures the whole of Chicago.

This feature of \"type-uniformity\" is found in many of the types of entities studied in the natural sciences.There are exceptions in the natural sciences; there are classes of phenomena that embody substantial variance among individuals in the class.  Hurricanes and volcanoes are examples of \"type-heterogeneous\" concepts in the natural sciences.  In these examples, the phenomena are grouped together in terms of a set of crude observable characteristics; it is then a question for research to determine whether there are common structures and causal backgrounds that constitute one or more sub-groups of items within the classification.  But more typical types of entities in the natural sciences fall into \"natural kinds\" with common structural and causal properties.Consider now what is involved in arriving at knowledge about a complex social reality -- the city of Chicago, for example.  The social reality of Chicago is constituted by the social behaviors of the individuals who live in Chicago and the institutions that these individuals populate. Consider some of the topics concerning which we might want to gather knowledge:What is the health status of Chicagoans?What is the climate for race relations in Chicago?What is the standard of living in Chicago?What is the rate of economic growth in Chicago?How do people in Chicago feel about higher education?What is the climate for new-business startup in Chicago?How well do the institutions of the mayor's office and the city council work?How are the Chicago public schools performing?Notice that almost all these questions invite us to consider the heterogeneity of the population and its organizations.  There is an average level of heart disease in the city.  But the average is a poor indicator of any particular person's health, because there are socially significant differences across groups with respect to almost all these questions.  So a study of health in Chicago requires that we consider some of the ways in which different groups are affected by a variety of circumstances in ways that systematically affect their health status.These facts suggest that a statement about a social characteristic of a large population needs to be nuanced, indicating the degree of variation of the characteristic across individuals and groups within the population as well as the most significant sub-populations showing the greatest variance from the group mean behavior.  Race, ethnicity, gender, geography, age, income, employment, labor-union membership, and education might be variables that define groups with significantly different measures of the variable of interest. And once we have determined that certain social characteristics (race, income, and union membership, let us say) are associated with the outcome of interest (health status, say), then we are stimulated to ask the causal question: what are the social mechanisms at work that produce the associations that are discovered?"}, {"title": "Is industrial agriculture sustainable?", "date": "Tuesday, November 13, 2007", "text": "The world's food system depends largely on a farming system with post-green-revolution techniques: new seed varieties, substantial use of chemical fertilizers and pesticides, large-scale irrigation, machine-based cultivation, production for large markets, and separation of production from consumption by long distances. This system shows the highest productivity the world has ever seen, whether measured in terms of labor, land, or cost. And the system does a fairly good job of producing enough food for the world's 6 billion people.But is this system sustainable?Several large issues arise. First, the system is energy-intensive, so it poses significant demands on the petroleum economy. The use of petroleum and energy pervades the process: fuel for cultivation and transport, energy and inputs into the production of chemical fertilizers and pesticides, energy consumed in irrigation. So a part of the sustainability question has to do with the energy challenge the globe faces.Second, industrial agriculture has massive environmental effects. Fertilizer and animal waste runoffs lead to groundwater and river pollution (extending into the Gulf of Mexico). Degradation and loss of topsoil is another large and longterm environmental effect with serious consequences for future agricultural productivity. And methane produced by large-scale cattle- and swine-rearing represents a measurable component of global warming. So the environmental effects of industrial agriculture are very large--once again raising the question of global sustainability.Finally, industrial agriculture, and the integrated global commodity markets from which this system is inseparable, have large and destructive consequences for traditional agriculture and the communities built around traditional farming. The effect of NAFTA and the export of US corn to Mexico has been massive in its disruption of maize-based culture and communities in Mexico.Three questions are central. First, is this system sustainable in the narrow sense, or will it collapse of its own burden of soil, water, and air pollution in the next 50 years? Second, is it a potential part of a larger sustainable global system of production and consumption from an environmental point of view? Or does global sustainability require radical change in agriculture? And finally, are there feasible alternative systems that would be less environmentally harmful, more sustainable, and less disruptive of agrarian communities? Are these alternatives scaleable to the needs of mass societies, large cities, and a global population of 6-8 billion? Can alternative systems achieve the productivity needed to feed the world's population?Environmentalists, global justice activists, and food activists have argued that there are alternatives. The Fair Trade movement is trying to get first-world consumers to favor fair-trade-certified products in their consumption--giving greater security and income to third-world farmers. Organic farming advocates argue that a system of smaller farms, organic fertilizers, innovative pest control, and farming techniques more suited to the local environment would have a smaller environmental footprint. \"Local food\" activists support the idea of shifting consumption towards products that can be grown locally--thus reducing transport and refrigeration and giving more of a market for small farmers.So there are alternatives in technique and policy that could result in different farm characteristics that are more favorable from the points of view of justice, sustainability, and community. The hard question is whether these alternatives could be scaled to the volume needed to feed a mass population. And this is a question that demands careful scientific analysis.(An excellent current critique of industrial agriculture is Michael Pollan's The Omnivore's Dilemma: A Natural History of Four Meals.)"}, {"title": "Historians and the philosophy of history", "date": "Monday, November 12, 2007", "text": "How should the philosophy of history interact with the practice of working historians?The philosophy of history is challenged to discover and explore the most fundamental questions about historical inquiry and knowledge.  How should this research be conducted?  And how should the philosopher's development of the subject make use of the practice of the historian?  Look at this question from the point of view of the historian, and we will find that the separation between \"doing\" and \"reflecting upon\" history is not as sharp as it might appear.For the best historians, there is no recipe for good historical inquiry and exposition.  There are methods and practices of archival research, to be sure, and there are general recommendations like \"be well informed about existing knowledge about your subject matter.\"  But the great historians take on their subjects with fresh eyes and new questions.  They often arrive at novel ways of framing their historical questions; they find new ways of using available historical evidence, or finding new historical evidence; they discover new ways of drawing inferences from historical data; they arrive at new ways of presenting their knowledge and narratives; and they question existing assumptions about \"causation,\" \"agency,\" or \"historical period.\"  As the historian grapples with the topic of research and the evidence that pertains to the topic, he or she is forced to think creatively about issues that go to the heart of historical inquiry and reasoning.  In other words, the historian is forced to think as a philosopher of history, in order to achieve new insights into the problems she considers.There is a less creative approach to historical research, of course.  One can choose a familiar topic; seek out some new sources that have not yet been fully explored; adopt some familiar theoretical motifs; and place the findings into a standard narrative for publication.  This mechanical approach resembles \"normal science\" for historians.  But the results of this type of approach are inherently disappointing; it is unlikely in the extreme that new historical insights will emerge.So when we consider the work of really imaginative historians, we find that the researcher is functioning as a philosopher of history at the same time as he or she is developing an innovative approach to the historical question under examination.  And this means that the philosopher can gain great insight by working very carefully with the writings of these great historians.  The philosopher can probe questions of historical inquiry, historical reasoning, historical presentation, and historical knowledge, by thinking through these questions in conversation with the working historian.Consider a few examples that illustrate this productive possibility.  First, consider the evolving state of affairs in historical treatments of the French Revolution.  In the past forty years historians have taken a shifting series of perspectives on the events, social conflicts, cultural circumstances, and political realities of the Revolution.  New research and new narratives have emerged on the Ancien Regime, the revolution, the Terror, and the consolidation of power by Napoleon.  Fertile historians such as Soboul, Cobb, Darnton, Schama, Sewell, or Chartier have tested and explored a variety of new perspectives -- from Marxism, from social history, from cultural studies.  And they have provided a much more nuanced body of knowledge about the social and cultural reality of the Revolution.  This body of work provides a rich domain of conceptual and historiographical material for the philosopher of history.A second example is the lively debate that has occurred about comparative economic history of England and China.  In the past 15 years historians of Chinese economic history have challenged standard models of economic development and have argued for a more balanced comparative economic history for Eurasia.  This debate has moved into great detail in the effort to answer such basic questions as whether China's agricultural economy was declining, static, or rising in productivity in the 17th century; or whether the standard of living was higher or lower at opposite ends of Eurasia.  Once again, a philosopher of history can find great stimulation to further conceptual and philosophical research by studying this debate in detail; the debate provides a living example of how historical knowledge is born.So my answer to the primary question here is this: that the philosophy of history needs to be fully immersed in some specific historical debates involving the most creative and imaginative historians.  Careful study of these debates and sustained interaction with historians like these will lead in turn to much more developed understanding of the nature of historical reasoning."}, {"title": "Variation across a social identity", "date": "Sunday, November 11, 2007", "text": "What does possession of a social identity come down to, for the individual? And how do identities vary across the population of people who possess this identity?First, let us stipulate that an identity is a feature of consciousness, an aspect of mentality.  And let us stipulate further that an identity comes to one as a result of one's experiences in the world, and one's attempt to make sense of those experiences. These assumptions are not indisputable -- it might be maintained that one can be unaware of one's social identity, or that one's social identity is constituted by one's position in society (a structural fact rather than a fact about one's experience). But these are credible beginnings.Next, it is clear that an identity is not one unified element of consciousness--an ineffable but uniform sense of being \"Irish,\" \"Southern\", or \"Hindu\". Instead, an identity must be more like a flavor or a scent: a complex but distinctive blend of more basic elements (tastes or smells).  This feature already implies several broad forms of differentiation across an identity group: the mix of elements may be different (a little rosemary blended into the scent of a rose), and there may be differences in the intensities of various elements in the mix.What are the components of which an identity is composed? Here are some plausible candidates: memories and stories, values, emotions, ways of reasoning, factual beliefs, a sense of justice. (Notice that some of these are content and some are mental process--beliefs versus reasoning, for example). Presumably there are other components that should be considered; but these will do for now.Where do these elements come from for the individual? Through learning and lived experience. One's rich and intimate experience of living with others -- family, friends, neighbors -- who possess values and who tell stories about \"who we are\" is a thick form of personal development. And one's own experience of the values and emotions of others -- the experience of racism and discrimination if one is black and gay -- is a powerful catalyst for shaping one's view of the world. This experience shapes one's values, sense of justice, and key memories.Now return to the question of variation across a group. It is clear that an identity shaped along these lines will show great variation across individuals. Each individual's experiences are somewhat different. And each person will process those experiences somewhat differently. What makes an identity a socially shared identity is the fact that some groups have a high degree of commonality of experience -- both through exposure to the prior generation and through one's own experiences in everyday life. But at the same time it is apparent that there will be substantial variation in values, memories, narratives, and styles of thought within the identity group. So the social identity of being \"Latino\", \"Polish\", or \"disabled\" should not be expected to be a uniform and homogeneous feature of consciousness. The metaphors of \"flavor\" and \"patchwork\" serve us better.This brings us to a preliminary conclusion: social identities should be expected to show significant variation across individuals.[It is intriguing to note that it would be possible to pursue this theory of the psychological constitution of a social identity by trying to measure and map the variations of the components across a population. Opinion surveys would permit measurement of the distribution of certain diagnostic values and judgments of injustice, for example.  We could then ask questions like these: Are these characteristics correlated within the population? Do some variables show more variance than others? How do these distributions of the variables compare with those of the general population?](See Mentalit\u00e9s, Identities, and Practices for more on this subject.)"}, {"title": "Is morality a social factor?", "date": "Saturday, November 10, 2007", "text": "Is morality a concrete sociological factor that has social consequences?  Or is it simply a theoretical construction by philosophers and other moral theorists and advocates?Human beings act, and their actions are often influenced or even determined by their moral values.  This seems to be an empirical fact.  (They also act out of self-interest, out of cruelty, out of disregard for others, out of impulse, and in a variety of other ways in which ethics plays no part.)  An adequate theory of human deliberation and agency appears to require an account of how values and moral commitments figure into ordinary decision-making and agency. This fact, in turn, seems to provide the beginnings of a basis for a \"yes\" to the question of whether morality is socially real.  Ethical values and norms are a behavioral reality; and this fact about individuals also has aggregative consequences for group behavior (in politics and in ordinary life).But now shift the focus a bit and consider \"philosophical ethics\" -- the writing and thinking about ethical principles by philosophers (Mill, Sidgwick, Kant, Aristotle, Rawls, for example).  Philosophical ethics is mostly about debates concerning ethical theories.  Is the principle of utility the foundation of moral truth?  Is the categorical imperative rather the foundation?  Are there rational grounds for choosing Kant's moral system over Bentham's?  What does the principle of utility require -- maximizing average utility or total utility?  Should utility consequences of an action be assessed through the consequence of this particular action or general rules of action that might govern this particular act? Do philosophy and logic have a basis in rationality to allow confident judgment about fundamental questions of ethics?  These are abstract, theoretical debates.  And it is hard to see how they could have direct behavioral effects.  So we might say, \"philosophical ethics is not a social factor.\"So far, then, we have \"morality in social behavior\" and \"ethics in philosophy\".  Is there a connection between the two realms?  One possible connection is this: Our theory of human decision-making might incorporate a rational faculty of deliberation; so when people act \"morally\", a part of their deliberation is a consideration of reasons for and against a certain conduct.  This is an empirical question.  If we pursue this avenue, then ordinary actors are also moral philosophers; they are probing for reasons and facts that would tip the scales of judgment.On the other hand, our theory of moral psychology might go in the direction of habit and inculcation rather than rational deliberation.  We might hypothesize that individuals absorb a set of values and prohibitions, analogous to food preferences and aversions, and that these values are beyond rational deliberation and judgment.  (Can one reason herself out of an aversion to eating dog?)  On this approach, there is no connection between rationality and moral behavior, and philosophy and real social behavior do not intersect.From a sociological point of view, it seems we need theories at several levels.  We need a theory of the ways that individuals think, reason, and deliberate when they act (an empirical theory of practical agency).  We need a theory of the social mechanisms and institutions through which individuals come to have the parameters and content of their deliberative systems set in particular ways.  We need empirical descriptions of the real content of human moral deliberation in various groups and cultures.Of particular importance for a sociology of morality is the question of the social mechanisms through which moral values and commitments are transmitted -- analogous to the question of how languages and practical skills are transmitted. How are value systems and styles of moral reasoning transmitted from one generation of individuals to another? That is, we need a theory of the \"micro-foundations\" of moral psychology and social development. And we ought to have an account of how it is that the psychological capacity for moral thinking has emerged through human evolution; are there \"moral emotions\" that support the efficacy of moral thinking in action?  (Allan Gibbard provides some very interesting discussion on these issues in Wise Choices, Apt Feelings: A Theory of Normative Judgment.)The perspective I favor is one in which we understand the individual as a deliberative reasoner, subject to non-rational as well as rational factors.  The individual has a spectrum of choice; he or she can consider the nature of the action being contemplated, its fit with other values he adheres to, and the consequences of the action for others.  Actions are not causally determined by an antecedent set of likings and aversions. So the individual has the capacity for functioning as his own philosophical consultant. On this perspective, the philosophical concepts of \"deliberation\" and \"reflective equilibrium\" are useful and illuminating about real human reasoners. So philosophy can contribute to our understanding of social cognition and decision-making.At the same time, it strikes me that professional philosophers can contribute best to ethical deliberation and moral development when they refrain from foundational assertions and simply provide good illustrations of how deliberation and consideration of circumstances and consequences can most thoughtfully proceed.  Philosophers should consider themselves as \"deliberative consultants\" rather than \"deductive inference engines\" when it comes to ethical reasoning.This perspective allows for morality to play a role in social causation that is analogous to the role of rationality in economics and political science.  Descriptive moral sociology can function in a way that is logically similar to rational choice theory, in that it represents a hypothesis about the nature of agency: when agents deliberate in such-and-so a way, within the framework of such-and-so moral commitments and such-and-so interests and goals, they are likely to behave in such-and-so a way.(Thomas Nagel's The Possibility of Altruism is a particularly interesting and provocative work bringing together ethical theory and theories of real practical reasoning.)Think about the multiple ways that \"identity\" comes into social life.  We think we know what someone means when he says he is African-American, Southern, gen-X, and professional.  But of course the reality is much more complex, both within the person and across the group.  Each identity label brings with it a cluster of values and attitudes that hang together across a population of people.  These clusters are cross-cutting: it may be that there are values shared by many Southerners, both white and black, that differentiate them from Northerners and constitute a dimension of social identity; likewise there is a cluster of values and attitudes shared by African-Americans in both South and North; and so on for youth culture and work culture.  (This is sometimes referred to as \"intersectionality\" and the politics of intersectionality.)One question we can ask is how these various identities co-exist in one person.  How does the individual's psychological system incorporate and process features of identity?  How does political and social cognition work at the level of the individual?  What determines whether one identity is more salient than another in a given context for a given person?  How do the various identity configurations interact within the person; how do behavior and preference result from the several identity configurations?  Is there a problem of coherence among the identities?  Can one be conflicted over the dictates and affects of the several identities he or she possesses? (Is this illustrated by religious conservative gay politicians?)Another challenging question is how these identity configurations vary across a population of people who can be said to possess the identity.  It is clear that identities are not uniform across a population; it is not the case that there is one profile of \"American Baptist\" that fits all Baptists.  So we need to have some way of conceptualizing how a given identity is instantiated in different ways across individuals within a given group.We also need a theory of the mechanisms of transmission and maintenance that serve to proliferate an identity across generations and through a population.  What are the processes through which individuals and groups acquire their identities?  There are some obvious mechanisms--personality development within the family, exposure to values and identities in schools and faith institutions, exposure to identity commitments through the media and the internet.  But it would be very useful to have more focused and detailed studies of the ways in which identities are transmitted at the level of the developing individual.Each of these questions -- the individual-level question and the group-level question -- has implications for political choice and behavior.  A political movement requires mobilization of a group of people who are willing to act together for an outcome.  And mobilization often depends on the ability of the political organization to amplify some elements of identity within a population and damp down other elements.  In India, for example, it is possible to track the efforts of Hindu nationalist parties like the BJP aimed at making religious identity more salient than other civic or economic identities.  Contrast this strategy with the strategy of parties like the CPM of West Bengal, which bases its political mobilization on an identity of class.(Atul Kohli's Democracy and Discontent: India's Growing Crisis of Governability is an excellent discussion of some of these features of identity politics in India.)What is the basis of classification of items into groups?  And how do classifications fit into scientific inquiry and theory? First, what different types of classification are there?Essential: The items may share a common defining characteristic (e.g. \"liquid\", \"metal\")       -- Etiological: The items may share a common cause (e.g. \"viral illness\")       -- Structural: The items may share a common underlying structure (e.g. \"protein\", \"elm\")       -- Functional: The items may share a common function (e.g. \"weapon\", \"school\")Non-essential: The items may lack necessary and sufficient conditions but share some overlapping characteristics.       -- Symptomatic: The items may share a set of observable characteristics or symtoms (e.g. \"pneumonia\", \"schizophrenia\")       -- Cluster: the items may share some among a list of characteristics (e.g. \"game\", \"leader\")(It is a bit curious to observe that this amounts to a classification of systems of classification.)Now let's consider some social science terms and see where they fall in this scheme: riot, civil war, bicameral legislature, ethnic group, democracy, charismatic leader, financial city, working class organization.Several of these concepts are symtom or cluster concepts: riot, democracy. Several others are etiological or structural: civil war, bicameral legislature, financial city. One combines structural with functional criteria: bicameral legislature.Now suppose we have identified a set of things as being \"democracies\". They share some among a set of features that are associated with democracy, and there is no set of features shared by all instances. What kinds of social science inquiry can we do? First, we can do comparisons within the group of democracies we have identified; we can look for similarities and differences across the group. And second, we can ask whether membership in this group is associated with membership in some other group beyond what chance would predict. In other words, we can consider whether there are true statements like \"all democracies are X\" or \"most democracies are Y.\"It is not the case that \"all pneumonias respond to penicillin\"--for the reason that there are two causal and structural kinds of pneumonia, and only one of these involves organisms treatable with penicillin. The causal heterogeneity of this group means that strong generalizations are difficult or impossible here.The concepts of riot, revolution, and democracy are similarly heterogeneous, both causally and structurally. So we should expect only weak generalizations across this group and other social charactistics. On the other hand, the tools of social comparison are most valuable here. We can discover through additional comparative work within the category, whether there are similar structural and causal processes at work among instances of this concept."}, {"title": "Sociology as a social science discipline", "date": "Friday, November 9, 2007", "text": "Sociology is one of the core disciplines of the social sciences, along with political science, economics and anthropology.  So one might imagine that it is a coherent, unified, and comprehensive science with a well-defined subject matter and a clear set of methods.  But as most practitioners will agree, this is not the case.  And that is a good thing, because the social world is not a unified system that can be reduced to a small number of theoretical premises.Since its founding (or emergence?) in the nineteenth century, sociology has taken on a somewhat meandering set of topics for study: classification of whole societies, analysis of large social factors (race, crime, urbanization), study of the behavior of groups, provision of tools for social policy design, and study of particular institutions, social movements, globalization, and the organization of  businesses.  In 2007 the American Sociological Association includes 44 sections devoted to particular topics and methods.  The methods of inquiry and the models of explanation are equally varied, including quantitative analysis of large data sets, small-N comparisons, micro-sociological investigation, process-tracing, Marxism, functionalism, structuralism, and feminism.What does this diversity of topic, method, and theory imply about the discipline of sociology today?  Is it a unified discipline, or a patch-work melange of many topics and approaches, unified only by the fact that the subjects of investigation have to do with social processes and social behavior?  One possible interpretation is that the vast range of potential research subjects for sociology are covered by this patchwork structure.  Another possibility is that the current range of sub-disciplines is itself the product of many \"random walks\" down particular research approaches, with heavy coverage of some areas of potential research, sporadic coverage of some problems and no attention at all to other problems.  The latter possibility suggests in turn that there is ample room for future development of sociological research, in the formulation of new empirical problems and new theoretical approaches.  The discipline of sociology can continue to evolve and grow -- possibly in ways that lead to significant innovation in approach and explanatory strategy.An earlier posting on \"Racial Inequalities\" illustrates this point well.  There is no single methodology or theory that is uniquely suited to attempting to understand the racial outcomes that we observe in American society.  Instead, we need to combine the insights of many fields and approaches, in order to have a basis for explaining the patterns of segregation and inequality that we observe.The diversity and multi-dimensional aspects of contemporary sociology is in fact a scientific advantage, in my view.  This aspect of the discipline permits researchers to seek innovative approaches and innovative explanations of the social phenomena that they consider.  In fact, it is the occasional impulse towards trying to make the discipline \"more scientific\" by enforcing a paradigm of research and theory on junior researchers that is most debilitating to the progress of knowledge -- whether it is the rational choice paradigm in political science, Marxism in Chinese social science, or the quantitative methods paradigm in sociology.  Methodological and theoretical pluralism is an intellectual advantage.  Sociological researchers who are receptive to analyzing the multiple aspects of a social problem from several different points of view are more likely to arrive at truly illuminating analysis.  Not all these approaches will be equally fruitful; but a mixed \"portfolio\" of research strategies and theoretical models is more likely to be adequate to the messy reality of a changing social world."}, {"title": "Racial inequalities as a social science research topic", "date": "Thursday, November 8, 2007", "text": "W. E. B. Dubois described the problem of the twentieth century as the problem of the color line. He was right -- except in his expectation that the problem would be resolved within the century.  It has not been resolved.  American cities from east to west show the encrusted social residues of racism, racial discrimination, and racial disadvantage for African Americans.  The most basic statistics and geographical patterns of most old American cities bear this out.  Patterns of extreme residential and economic segregation persist in Chicago, Detroit, New York, Cleveland, and Peoria.   And these patterns of residential segregation are overlain by patterns of significant inequality in the most important dimensions of human welfare.  African American families suffer greater incidence of illness, lower income, lower educational attainment, and lower levels of wealth ownership.  The color lines in American cities are all too legible, and what they demarcate are major differences in social wellbeing across black and white communities. (Thomas Sugrue's book, The Origins of the Urban Crisis: Race and Inequality in Postwar Detroit, offers an eloquent and rigorous description of these geographical outcomes in Detroit.)There must be social mechanisms that maintain these differences.  These are not \"natural\" outcomes.  And the social sciences should help us uncover those mechanisms.  But where should we look for explanations and rigorous, honest empirical investigation? What areas of the social and behavioral sciences are most likely to offer satisfactory explanations of these patterns? And what mechanisms, at what social levels, are most likely to prove to have major impact in entrenching these patterns of racial segregation and difference over so many decades?Several areas of social and behavioral research seem particularly relevant: the social psychology of bias and discrimination; the study of the politics and finances of urban public schooling; the study of the dynamics of public health outcomes (asthma, diabetes, heart disease); the empirical sociology of employment and employment opportunities; the politics and logistics of urban transportation systems; the culture and economics of nutrition; the sociology of the family; and, of course, the histories of American cities.  It is likely that the facts of racial difference that persist are the results of a complex and interconnected set of social causes; we will need many areas of social science research and theory to allow us to sort these out.Parallel to the question of social causation is the question of public policy: what policy choices exist for governments and other organizations to intervene in ways that begin to reduce these forms of racial disadvantage?  What policy tools are efficacious in improving inner city schools, the nutrition and health of poor people, and the educational attainment of inner city youth? What policies of banking and employment can help to address the persistent inequalities of opportunity that exist with regard to borrowing and hiring?  How can public policies reverse the pattern of segregation and inequality of opportunity and outcome for black and white families?Some pressing questions--*     Are there any examples of American cities or states that have demonstrated success in redressing these patterns of racial inequality?*     How do these facts compare to the situation of other sizable minority populations in other countries--for example, France or Germany?*     When will political leaders place this persistent fact of racial inequality and diminished opportunity at the center of the political agenda for change?The idea of a religion is apparently a very familiar one. It is a set of beliefs about the sacred shared by a group of people. It embodies some fundamental norms that guide and constrain believers' conduct. It is a potent social force that can determine the outcomes of presidential elections.But notice the many complexities that these statements conceal. There is the question of the individual's psychology and mental life; how are religious beliefs and values embodied and acquired, and how do they function in the person's deliberative and affective schemes?Second is the question of the group's religious characteristics. An individualist would say that the group's religious identity is simply the sum of the religious characteristics of the individuals who compose it, and that there is normally a distribution of variants around each dimension or element of the religious identity. (In other words, the members of thexgroup are not homogeneous in their beliefs and behavior.)Third, we could dwell quite a while on the problem of formulating a theory of the core content of the religion, including beliefs, norms, and practices. The differences mentioned above imply that formulation of \"core\" beliefs is likely to be deeply controversial--witness the violence connected with schisms within religious traditions.Finally, we need to consider the concrete social institutions and organizations through which religious groups and movements do their work: promulgate their religious commitments and knowledge to the young and converts, mobilize the followers to collective action, and function as a community of belief and action.Notice the variety of disciplines that are invoked here in this still-brief account of the social efficacy of religion: personality psychology, social psychology, interpretative anthropology, political science, social movements theory, sociology, and the humanistic disciplines of philosophy, criticism, and hermeneutics.We find, then, that religion is not one single thing, and it exercises causal powers in very diverse ways. \"It\" is many psychological, semiotic, organizational things, loosely held together by the idea of a group of co-believers. And causal-sociological stories pass through this station in many directions and on many levels. The causal efficacy of religion refers sometimes to the power that ideas and values have over individual believers. Sometimes it refers to the power a group of believers wields over other members of the group. And sometimes it refers to the power that religious organizations have over other persons through their sources of influence and threat -- a very secular exercise of power.This comes down to several forms of efficacy -- the ability toinfluence behavior through the grip of ideas, the ability to mobilize supporters, and the ability to marshall other more secular forms of power and influence."}, {"title": "Is globalization unjust?", "date": "Wednesday, November 7, 2007", "text": "Globalization has many aspects. But consider this narrow definition: extension of international economic interdependence through unfettered international trade and investment. This process leads to a shifting of centers of economic activity as investors and entrepreneurs seek out favorable locations for business activity--mining, manufacturing, financial services, transportation and logistics, etc. Businesses will seek out low-cost environments for doing business activities.  Among other factors, labor costs, environmental costs, and resource availability will drive patterns of investment. The process results in economic growth -- that is, an absolute increase in the wealth and income created by the system as a whole.  The resulting patterns will have consequences for incomes, environmental effects, and the flows of wealth among places on the planet.Neo-liberal trade theory asserts that this international trading system will be welfare-enhancing overall: the gains to winners will exceed the losses to losers. The theory also disaggregates: a poor country will make better use of its resources and will be better off than before globalization.  Let's take these points as true for the sake of argument -- though many critics of neo-liberal economic theory would dispute the assumptions that this assessment makes.So, once again, is this process just, or does it simply perpetuate the debilitating effects of past injustice?Before we can even begin to answer the question, we have to decide what we mean by \"justice\" in a global economic setting. Is a just system one in which everyone gets what he or she deserves?  Or one in which everyone's outcome corresponds to his or her contribution to the product?  Or one in which everyone's outcome is sufficient to permit him or her to satisfy basic needs for human development? Might we say that a just system is one that treats all parties fairly?  And where does \"fair equality of opportunity\" come into the formula -- would we want to say that an outcome is just whenever it has resulted from a non-coercive, rule-governed process in which conditions of fair equality of opportunity have been assured for all participants?  And, of course, what do each of these formulas come down to in practical terms?One reason why problems of justice are so difficult to think about in the context of global development, is the fact of the extreme inequalities that existed, and continue to exist, internationally -- both before and during the processes of globalization.  Many of theseinequalities were manifestly unjust -- because they derived from coercive and unfair relations between countries of very unequal power (colonialism and conquest, for example). So what would be a just pathway of transition, from an unjust prior distribution of wealth andpower, to a later more just distribution of wealth and power?We might also say that the situation of global justice is a bit similar to the situation of bargaining among parties with grossly unequal prior assets.  Some people would judge that an unforced agreement between two parties is guaranteed to be fair by the fact of consent; the fact of consent implies that each party judges that he/she is better off with the agreement than without it -- so each has improved his/her welfare.  (This is what underlies the theory of Pareto-optimality.)  But if the bargaining situations of the parties are significantly unequal, then it is easy enough to see how the stronger party can \"take advantage\" of the weaker party (the central result of bargaining theory).  The division of the benefits of cooperation will be tilted towards the more well-off party; so is this a fair division of the fruits of cooperation?So consider three different answers to the question, is globalization unjust?*   No, globalization is not unjust in the ideal circumstance in which every country and region can make free choices about the use of its resources and the agreements it makes with other parties.  Each country will strive to make the choices that maximize the creation ofwealth and income it produces within the global system. What would make globalization unjust is if the process depends on coercion, corruption, and fraud.*   Yes, globalization is unjust, because the benefits of global cooperation are enormously biased to favor the interests of the rich and powerful. And even if the rules of international cooperation are unbiased (a claim that is often disputed), the superior bargaining situation of the wealthy nations guarantees a division of the benefits of cooperation that favors the wealthy over the poor.*   It is too early to say either way.  The answer depends on what the outcomes are in fifty years.  If international trade theory turns out to be true; if every region is able to develop its resources and human talent; if every region experiences significant economic growth and improvement of human development -- then we may judge that globalization was a just process.   If inequalities and human deprivation are even greater in some parts of the world in fifty years, then the process has proven to be unjust."}, {"title": "A new philosophy of history?", "date": "Tuesday, November 6, 2007", "text": "Why would we want a philosophy of history? And what is wrong with the one we've got?First, why? Philosophers want to know how good the claims are for \"knowledge\" in various fields. So we have philosophy of science, philosophy of mathematics, philosophy of logic, and so on. This is one reason for pursuing a philosophy of history: what is the status of specialists' knowledge of the past? What methods exist for arriving at knowledge about the past? How broad or narrow is the range of uncertainty about different kinds of historical claims?In a similar vein, philosophers are interested in exploring and resolving some of the difficult conceptual problems and assumptions that arise in various areas of thought. There are many such puzzles in historical claims to knowledge: What are \"contingency\" and \"necessity\"? Are historical beliefs \"objective\" or \"biased\"? What is the relation between history and memory? Are there \"periods\" and \"epochs\" in history? Are ther civilizations and peoples?Some philosophers have also pursued questions about the content ofhistory itself. Does history have direction or meaning? Does history shape a people? Is history an integrated fabric with common processes, or is it an amalgam of distinct and unrelated events? Is there such a thing as \"the Russian Revolution\" or \"the Great Wall of China\"?So there is a reasonable subject matter for the discipline; but what is wrong with the philosophy of history we currently possess? First, writings on this subject don't really add up to a coherent and reasonably comprehensive set of ideas. Certain topics have grabbed the stage--Are there laws in history? What is a narrative? Is history teleological?--and have refused to give the spotlight to the other characters. So we might say, we need fresh thinking by talented philosophers who can re-identify a leading set of topics for discussion.But second, and more fundamentally, philosophers have engaged \"history\" at too great a distance from great historians.  Read any really excellent piece of historical writing today--Spence, Schama, Darnton, Bloch--and you will be struck by a raft of interesting philosophical and conceptual issues. And a new philosophy of history needs to incorporate as much of this range of working historical reasoners as possible.Finally, why does it matter? It matters because history matters. At any point in time we are created, influenced and formed by our histories. And philosophy reasonably should shed some light on this fact. (See The Philosophy of History in the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy for more on this subject.)How do social causes work?Some social theorists have treated social constructs as unified macro-entities with their own causal powers. Structuralist theories maintain things like \"capitalism causes people to value consuming more than family time\" or \"democracy causes social cohesion.\" Likewise, some theorists have held that moral systems and cultures cause distinctive patterns of behavior--\"Confucian societies produce cohesive families.\" Each of these claims places a large social entity in the role of a causal factor.Is this a coherent way of talking? Can large structures and value systems exercise causal influence? The problem here is that statements like these look a lot like \"action at a distance\". We are led to ask: HOW do capitalism, democracy, or Confucianism influence social outcomes? In other words, we want to know something about the lower-level mechanisms through which large social facts impact upon behavior, thereby producing a change in social outcomes. We want to know something about the \"microfoundations\" of social causation.One point seems obvious--and yet it is often overlooked or denied. Social behaviors are carried out by individuals, and individuals are influenced only by factors that directly impinge upon them (currently or in the past). Consider a particular voter's process of deciding to support  particular candidate. This person experienced a particular history of personality formation--a particular family, a specific city, a work history, an education. So the person's current political identity and values are the product of a sequence of direct influences. And at the moment, this socially-constructed person is now exposed to another set of direct influences about the election race---newspapers, internet, co-workers' comments, attendance at political events, etc.  In other words, his or her current political judgments and preferences are caused or influenced by a past and current set of experiences and contexts.This story brings in social factors at every stage--the family was Catholic, the city was Chicago, the work was a UAW-organized factory. So the individual is socially influenced and formed at every stage. But here is the important point: every bit of that social influence is mediated by locally experienced actions and behaviors of other socially formed individuals. \"Catholicism\", \"Chicago culture\", and \"union movement\" have no independent reality over and above the behaviors and actions of people who embody those social labels.This perspective is sometimes called methodological individualism. I prefer to call it methodological localism. We never lose the social in this story. But it is always a locally embodied social, conveyed through pathways that directly impinge upon the socially constituted person. It is then a subject of real sociological interest, to discover the pathways and variations through which the large social entities are embodied. And in this way we avoid the error of \"reification\" of the large social entity."}, {"title": "A world sociology?", "date": "Sunday, November 4, 2007", "text": "Contemporary sociology developed in consideration of western social processes and western ideas about science. Central defining problems included state formation, social solidarity and cohesion, urbanization, and the politics of class. (The experienced reader will recognize the imprint of the classical social theorists here--Weber, Durkheim, and Marx especially.) But it is worth considering that sociology might take a very different course if we placed the problems and processes of the developing world at the center rather than the periphery of sociological inquiry. Would we arrive at the same central concepts? How would the paradigms change?This question is not purely hypothetical. It is very reasonable for social scientists in developing countries to take a fresh look at the basic problems and concepts that can give future direction to a sociology for the twenty-first century. We ought not assume that existing paradigms will provide the resources necessary to understand and resolve the problems of social behavior and process found in China, Indonesia, or Mexico today. And it is likely enough that the new insights and theories that emerge from this new thinking in Shanghai or Mexico City will in fact provide new ways of looking at Chicago and New York.One likely result will be that next-generation \"world\" sociology will be less interested in formulating master theories of large social processes--urbanization, ethnic conflict, demographic transition--and more interested in disaggregating large social processes into smaller component processes. The processes creating mega-cities in Africa, Brazil, or the Philippines have numerous dimensions and tempos. And it seems plausible that the best sociological investigations of urbanization of the future will result from an eclectic effort to discover the multiple social causes that lead to social behavior resulting in rapid urban growth.So this is a critical time for sociologists and political scientists in the developing world. Will they seize this opportunity to refocus the research agenda and the tools of theory that will give rise to a more adequate sociology for a global world? Or will the paradigms and methods of positivist sociology continue to define the social-science agenda?A paradigm shift along these lines is already underway--in the field of economic history. A current generation of economic historians of China has argued for a non-eurocentric comparison of Europe and Asia, with the view that both historical experiences have distinctive mixes of institutions and economic imperatives. Historians like Bin Wong and Kenneth Pomeranz argue that both Europe and Asia can be understood better on the basis of a more balanced consideration of the other. (See \"Eurasian Comparisons\" for some relevant discussion.)There is also an important precedent for the creaton of a new sociology for a changed world, in the experience of the Chicago School of sociology in the early twentieth century. Chicago school sociologists stepped away from the certainties of classical sociology, in order to formulate theories and methods that worked better for handling the messy, complex realities of a great city.  The results were more eclectic, more middle-level, and more open to the idea of innovations in sociology than the master paradigms of classical sociology. Sociologists in Beijing, Manila, and Mexico City can do the same.Let's think more about the extent and pace of plasticity in social organization by considering an example: hospitals. Hospitals are complex social organizations geared towards providing health care for moderately to very needy patients. And the internal organization of hospitals provides a fertile locus for examining issues of institutional change.The complexity of a hospital derives from numerous factors: the specialization of medical knowledge (resulting in numerous departments), the multiplicity of business functions (billing, marketing, finance and budget, supervision of doctors, nurses, pharmacists, support staff), the logistical demands of patient care (food, medications, room and bed cleaning), social work needs of patients and families, the regulatory environment, governance institutions, and communication to the public, simply to name the most obvious functions. So a hospital requires the coordinated efforts of hundreds of experts and perhaps thousands of skilled and semi-skilled workers, embodying tens or hundreds of functions. (A mid-sized regional hospital employs several thousand people.)Diversity and plasticity comes into this story in several ways. At the mid-level of analysis there are alternative ways of organizing the various functions of the hospital--different ways of organizing human resources, billing, or patient services. That is, structure is underdetermined by functional needs.  There are organizational alternatives, and we can expect that there will be actual variation in hospital organization and implementation across the US health system.This variation can be observed at a range of scales: within a region (Atlanta), across regions (Atlanta versus Detroit), or throughout the national system (midwest versus Pacific coast).  At the most macro-level, we may observe differences in organization across national systems--US versus Germany or China.  (Frank Dobbin's Forging Industrial Policy: The United States, Britain, and France in the Railway Age explores this sort of  national-level comparison in application to technology policy frameworks in three countries.)But diversity may also be observed over time at the level of the individual hospital. This is sometimes described as \"organizational learning\"--internal reorganization and redesign so as to better serve patient and business needs in a changing environment. Plasticity comes in here: the organization \"mutates\" in response to changing needs and new environmental challenges. (Consider some of the ways that hospitals will change as a result of new public reporting requirements concerning cost and morbidity.)This mutation may be the result of deliberate choice on the part of hospital administrators (redesign of process). But it may also be the result of broader societal changes leading to changing behavior within the hospital, eventually leading to a change in the routine practices and organizations of the hospital. For example, the operating room of the US hospital of the 1990s is a social space governed explicitly and implicitly by the surgeon (usually male). But imagine the result of a broad values shift towards greater gender equality and less respect for hierarchical authority. We might expect a gradual shift in the operating room towards a team-based approach to surgery. That approach might be confirmed by a record of greater safety (as safety experts in fact expect). And the change might become entrenched in new formal operating rules and procedures--thus changing the institution for a while.These arguments show the impulse towards differentiation across hospital structures. There is also an important \"centripetal\" force that works towards convergence to some degree. This is the process of imitation and the search for \"best practices\". Consultants are summoned; \" how are other hospitals handling this problem of IV infections?\" And successful efforts are imitated.This example suggests a process of mutation, differentiation, imitation, and occasional convergence. Overall, it supports the vision of institutions as plastic and malleable and responsive to changing individual and societal needs.The most frequently visited page on my research web site (out of more than 90 articles) is an encyclopedia article on false consciousness. Moreover, many of these visitors come from the developing world, including especially the Philippines. I am curious about these facts.False consciousness is a Marxist concept. It refers to the hypothesis that oppressed people have a worldview that systematically conceals the reality and causes of their oppression. The concept is associated with Lukacs, Althusser, and Gramsci.But once again, why so much current interest in the concept? It is common to observe that \"Marxism is dead\"--no longer a useful tool of analysis in the 21st century. But here we find a lively interest in a particular Marxist concept.  Why is this concept so frequently searched on Google?I cannot confidently answer the question. But here are a few possibilities.First, oppression and economic exploitation are certainly not gone from the scene. And yet there is little organized economic struggle going on in the world today. Perhaps critical thinkers in developing countries are turning to false consciousness as a possible diagnosis.Second, the rhetoric of globalization suggests that everyone gains from these processes of international trade and the global movement of capital. And yet the locally visible realities appear quite different in Chiapas or Manila. So perhaps the mis-match that appears to exist between representation and reality about the effects of globalization brings thoughtful observers back to the theory of false consciousness.Third, it is a fact that media (including the Internet) have massive and growing ability to shape public consciousness and ideas. Perhaps this is the most visible mark of the twenty-first century.  It is natural to ask, in whose interests does this shaping take place? And what kinds of systematic and deliberate bias are embedded in this media stream? What is the connection between \"interest\" and \"representation\"? Perhaps it is logical that third-world thinkers are turning to Lukacs and Gramsci in order to find tools for analyzing this system of consciousness-formation.So perhaps the interest we found on the topic of false consciousness is understandable, a response to some current and powerful features of the current economic and social system."}, {"title": "Positivism and social science", "date": "Saturday, November 3, 2007", "text": "There is a strong current of positivism in contemporary sociology --in fact, one might say this is the dominant paradigm. Other paradigms exist -- feminism, Marxism, comparative historical sociology, and ethnographic sociology, to name several. But the claim of science is generally couched in terms of a positivist theory of science and inquiry.  This is unsurprising, in that several of the founders of sociology (Comte, Mill, and Durkheim in particular) were most emphatic in asserting the necessary connection between the two ideas, and Comte invented both \"positivism\" and \"sociology\" as modern terms.The core assumptions of positivism include these: that social science is identical in its logic to natural science; that science involves the search for general laws about empirical phenomena; and that discovery and explanation depend upon a rigorous empirical scrutiny of the phenomena under question.  Positivism is doubtful about the role of theory, preferring instead to make do with empirical observations, classes of empirical phenomena, and generalizations across classes of phenomena.  Finally, positivism is dubious about the reality of causal connections between empirical phenomena.It is true that science requires rigorous empirical inquiry.  But much of the rest of the positivist program turns out to be badly suited to social science research and explanation.  This is so for several reasons.  First, social phenomena do not fall into fixed and distinct \"types\", in which the members of the type are homogeneous.  We can generalize about \"water\", but not about \"revolution\", for the simple reason that all samples of pure water have the same structure and observable characteristics; but not so for all \"revolutions\".  The category of \"revolution\" is not a \"kind\", and we should not imagine that we can arrive at a set of necessary and sufficient conditions for membership in this group.Second, there are few lawlike generalizations about social entities and processes (if any at all!).  Each revolution, for example, proceeds according to a historically specific set of causes and circumstances.  And there are no genuinely interesting generalizations across the whole category.Third, it is important in social science to formulate hypotheses about unobservable mechanisms of causal interconnectedness.  So \"theory\" is an important component of social-science thinking and the sociological imagination.Finally, explanation in the social sciences requires that we identify the causal mechanisms that connect one kind of social circumstance with another.  If we believe that improved transportation causes a change in habitation patterns, then we need to be able to provide a hypothesis and analysis of what the social mechanisms are that create this result.Positivism is a poor guide for social science inquiry. Instead, we need to approach social science research with a readiness to find contingency, heterogeneity, path-dependence, and particularity among the phenomena that we study--corresponding to the plasticity of human institutions and human agency.Is \"power\" different in the twenty-first century?Is power the same as \"ability to influence behavior\"?Do the internet and new forms of communication and social networking create new opportunities for power--for good or bad purposes?Think about the ways power was created and used in the nineteenth or twentieth centuries: the power of the state to regulate and enforce; the power of the police to arrest and confine; the power of Europe and North America to administer global empires; the power of the press to focus attention on subjects of concern (political corruption, tainted food, child labor).These forms of power turn on a few more basic ideas: the ability to use force in order to coerce or threaten; the ability to use mechanisms of communication to influence public opinion and action; the ability to deploy a dispersed bureaucracy in order to organize the actions of distant actors.Has the balance of power shifted between organized states and networked anti-state organizations?The exercise of power is a crucial mechanism of social causation, and the analysis of the sources and organization of power is an important task for social science and social theory.Ultimately social phenomena are the aggregate result of the behavior of socially constituted persons who are acting within the context of locally embodied institutions. If there are regularities within the social realm, they derive from common features of individual agency, common features of institutions, and common processes of aggregation of effects.This implies that social scientists should always keep in mind the real underlying behavioral and institutional settings that constitute the social processes or patterns they are interested in.It also implies that social scientists should expect plasticity and heterogeneity of social processes.There is more discussion of this perspective in \"Levels of the Social\".I believe we need to create significantly new approaches to the study of the social. Positivistic sociology, formalistic political science, highly mathematicized economics--these dominant paradigms in several disciplines proceed on the basis of misleading or overly narrow conceptions of science and the social. We need to do a much better job of crafting theories and research methods to the particular features of a social research topic. And we need to be much more open to the innovations and new perspectives that are emerging in various areas of the social sciences (for example comparative historical sociology). This means that there needs to be a freeranging, innovative consideration of the ways in which it is possible to study and explain various social phenomena. (See \"The Heterogeneous Social\" for more discussion of this critique.)(Ian Shapiro's The Flight from Reality in the Human Sciences is an interesting contribution.)I find it intriguing to imagine the sociological insights that might come from a discussion of a specific social problem that brings together the perspectives of some of the international visitors to this web site. How would observers from Manila, Lagos, Shanghai, and Detroit be able to contribute different perspectives on the issue of rising income inequality? Or the issue of racial discrimination? Or the issue of corruption? Or the challenge of an aging population?Is there a place in the task of creating a new discipline of sociology, for the networked intelligence of observers throughout the world?Does existing sociological theory and practice give us a basis for analyzing the important social problems that surround us -- or do we need to seek out new theories, new perspectives, and new methods?Can the richness that is present within a distributed community of thoughtful observers be the basis for a better science of sociology?"}, {"title": "Plasticity of the social", "date": "Friday, November 2, 2007", "text": "I maintain that virtually all social entities are \"plastic\": their properties change significantly over time, as a result of the purposive and unintentional behavior of the socially constructed individuals who make up a society.  Organizations, labor unions, universities, churches, and social identities all show a substantial degree of flexibility and fluidity over time, and this fact leads to a substantial degree of heterogeneity among groups of similar social organizations and institutions.  This points to a general and important observation about the constitution of the social world: The properties of a social entity or practice can change over time; they are not rigid, fixed, or timeless. They are not bound into consistent and unchanging categories of entities, such as \"bureaucratic state,\" \"Islamic society,\" or \"leftist labor organization.\" Molecules of water preserve their physical characteristics no matter what.  But in contrast to natural substances such as gold or water, social things can change their properties indefinitely.This interpretation interprets \u201cplastic\u201d as the contrary to \u201cstatic and fixed\u201d. A second way in which an entity might be unchanging is as a dynamic equilibrium.  A social structure might be a self-correcting system that restores its equilibrium characteristics in the face of disturbing influences.  The temperature in this room is subject to external influences that would result in change; but the thermostat provides cool or warm air as needed to bring the office temperature back to the equilibrium value. When I say that social entities are plastic, I also mean to say that they are not generally determined within a dynamic equilibrium (as sociological functionalism maintains, perhaps), with powerful homeostatic mechanisms that correct for disturbing influences. There is no \u201cessential\u201d form to which the structure tends to return in equilibrium.This ontology emphasizes a deep plasticity and heterogeneity in social entities.  Organizations and institutions change over time and place.  Agents within these organizations change their characteristics through their own behavior, through their intentional efforts to modify them, and through the cumulative effect of agents and behavior over time and place.  Social constructs are caused and implemented within a substrate of purposive and active agents whose behavior and mentality at a given time determine the features of the social entity.  As individuals act, pursue their interests, notice new opportunities, and innovate, they simultaneously \u201creproduce\u201d a given institution and also erode or change the institution.  So institutions are not fully homeostatic, preserving their own structure in the face of disturbances.  This is not to say that institutions lack such homeostatic mechanisms altogether; only that we cannot presuppose that a given institution or organization will persist in its fundamental characteristics over extended time and space.A familiar example will illustrate the kinds of plasticity and variation that I am thinking of.  Take the tenure process in American universities.  We can see an overall similarity in processes, rules, and goals in the tenure processes at various institutions.  Organization is to some extent influenced by function.  But we also see substantial variation and drift in both process and content (criteria and processes for awarding tenure).  For example, there are some universities that are incorporating \u201ccommunity service\u201d into tenure criteria.  Different universities give a different balance of faculty review and provost and dean review.  There are different cultures of seriousness in review by faculty committees and academic administrators.  Different institutions define different institutional goals: enhance national reputation of the faculty (through research productivity), improve teaching, orient faculty to community service, \u2026  There is a visible push-pull by stakeholders on these institutions: deans, provosts, presidents; faculty governance units; individual faculty.  There have been changes in the past 20 years that have affected many institutions: post-tenure review, greater willingness to do reviews leading to removal, \u2026  So tenure institutions display the variability and plasticity that I believe is inherent in all social institutions.So far I have focused on institutions and organizations.  But features of social consciousness and social identity are also variable across time, place, and group.  The mechanisms through which social identities and mentalities are transmitted, transmuted, and maintained are varied; inculcation, imitation, and common circumstances are central among these.  But the transmission of an identity is a bit like the transmission of a message through a telephone chain.  Because of \u201cnoise\u201d in the system, because of individual differences among the transmitters, and because of multiple other influences on micro-identities, we should expect great variation within and across groups with regard to the particulars of their social identities.  In fact, it appears that the plasticity of identities, norms, and mental frameworks is particularly great.  The mechanisms of transmission invite variation across successive instances and generations.  Local variations will take root in sub-populations.  There are limited mechanisms of homeostasis.  And individuals and groups have the ability to modify the content and meaning of these elements of social consciousness more or less indefinitely over time. Small variations in locally-embodied content proliferate through imitation and parent-child transmission.Finally, we might also say that individuals too are \u201cplastic\u201d.  The social psychology of the existing person is the product of the individual\u2019s earlier experiences, education, and training.  So this particular person\u2014perhaps now a \u201crational maximizer with racial prejudice and a fear of flying\u201d\u2014has been constructed through a concrete set of experiences.  But (a) this concrete present individual herself can be brought to change some basic motivational and psychological characteristics through additional experiences\u2014perhaps diversity training and a positive experience with a person of another race; and (b) other individuals from a similar background can be brought to have a different set of motivational characteristics through different circumstances of development.  So the individual\u2019s basic characteristics of personality, belief, and motivation are plastic.In each case we find that institutions, practices, and social identities show a substantial degree of plasticity over time and place.  And this is what we should expect--fundamentally, because we can sketch out the social processes and mechanisms through which institutions are formed, maintained, and modified. Institutions are human products and are embodied in human actions and beliefs.  Sometimes an institution is designed through a deliberative process; sometimes it results through a series of uncoordinated adaptations and appropriations by a number of participants.  Institutions solve social problems; they coordinate individual activity, control resources, allocate benefits and burdens.  And institutions either maintain their structure or change depending on the interests and actions of the participants.  The participants in institutions interact with the particulars of the organization in ways that improve the effectiveness of the organization, or better serve a particular set of interests, or some combination of both.  Leaders may determine that a modification of the institution would increase the capacity of the organization to deliver services, reduce costs, or improve their own ability to control activities within the organization.  Participants may modify the organization in their own ways\u2014through spontaneous local modifications of process; foot-dragging as a way of impeding the functioning of unpopular aspects of the organization; collaboration with other participants to modify the institution in directions more favorable to their interests; etc.So it is important for social scientists to avoid the fallacy of \"naturalism\"--the idea that social science should resemble natural science, and the idea that social entities have a similar constitution and ontology to natural entities."}]
