Mine isthe kickoff slot, at 1 p.m. My one-hour presentation will be “Supercharge YourPlot.” This is the earliest notice I can give, which I know isn’t much. But we’llhave a good time, so consider joining me and the other fine presenters. I mightalso note that Royal Caribbean canceled the sail date of the mystery-writing /forensics cruise I was so excited about, due to mechanical issues with the shipand drydock conflicts. But we’re hoping to reschedule that trip, again in partnershipwith Royal Caribbean and GoTravel.On to today’s business.I’ve been blogging weekly for almost six years now, eversince You’ve Got a Book in Youlaunched. And I’ve been thinking of taking a break, or ending the blogpermanently. One’s life has seasons. I feel the need to spend more timecreating other stuff, doing different things. And as I watched post #300approach, I thought such a nice round number would be a good place to conclude,or at least pause, this blog. Zestful Writing has led to a lot of coolinteractions, both in the comments section and via email, and I’ll miss that. Writinga weekly essay also makes you come up with ideas, think through your points andsupport them, and write as clearly and concisely as you can. That’s beenvaluable.But thinking up a weekly post, writing it, making aphotograph or sketch (or finding a free image on line), cropping and editing thatimage, uploading the whole thing and responding to comments—all that takes upmy writing time and energy for a day per week. That’s a pretty big commitment.I intend to make a book from the best of these posts, after I get through somemore projects.Which, yeah. Having given a lot of consideration to thequestions I posed in last week’s post (ZestfulBlog Post 299), I know I need to write more books at a brisker pace. Needto explore my fictional worlds further, and invent new ones. I want to writemore nonfiction, including more good stuff for writers, and I want to teachmore workshops, both in person and online. I need to simplify things where Ican. As I’ve noted here before, one’s time is a zero-sum game, and our days onthis earth are finite. If you know what your mission is, it’s a sin not toserve that mission. I intend to put out my newschats a bit more frequently, soif you’d like to keep up with me and all forthcoming work, please be sure you’reon that list, which is a different listfrom this blog. Sign up HERE.I guess one should never say never, so who knows but what I mightstart this blog up again someday. But for now, farewell. Do stay tuned via thenewschat, because I want to keep in touch with you. After all, you’re why I’mhere.Love,ElizabethWhat do you think?

{"title": "Writing Queer", "date": "Thursday, January 10, 2019", "text": "Zestful Blog Post #298[This week’s blog is a meaty excerpt from my article in thecurrent Writer’s Digest magazine, February, 2019.]I didn’t know it, but I was mentally ill until about age 16.Anybody queer was considered mentally ill until 1973, when the AmericanPsychiatric Association removed the diagnosis of homosexuality as a disorder(though ‘sexual orientation disturbance’ endured in the DSM until 1987). Likemillions of LGBT children and adults, I knew I was different, and not in asocially acceptable way. We didn’t even know there were millions of us. We thought maybe we were the only one.Back then, a person who wanted or needed to explore thequeer lifestyle had to be extremely circumspect in their hunt for informationand validation. The words queer, fag, homo, and lezzie were dreaded slurs, usedby even young children who didn’t know what the words meant.The word “queer,” however, has emerged as an acceptable termfor any kind of alternative sexuality or sexual orientation. LGBT, which standsfor lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender, is the clunky yet usefulinitialism that surfaced in the 1990s. The addition of Q, meaning queer,includes pretty much any sexual/gender variation, including intersexual,asexual, cross-dressing. Not everybody agrees to these shorthand helpers, butin the interest of simplicity, I’m using queer here as an all-inclusive term.Porn shops, peep shows, and underground bars, of course,were early refuges and—sad to say—cultural centers for queers. But if you wereyoung, you were kept out, and if you were of age, you risked exposure, withwhatever consequences, from arrest for ‘perversion,’ to expulsion from schoolor work, to ostracism by family, friends, peers.Enter literature. You figured maybe there were books thatcaptured the experience, right? So, alone, you hunted through library cardcatalogues and the stacks, looking for something—anything—to read. If youdidn’t feel safe bringing a book to the librarian to stamp and check out foryou, you stood in the stacks and read it there, shifting from foot to foot,ready to jam the book back into the shelf if anybody came by. Whatever books,that is, you could find.What is queer literature? Basically, anything in which themain character or characters are queer, and where a queer lifestyle isfeatured, where queer concerns are addressed. Coming-out stories were, andremain, popular.Why is queer lit even a thing? Because people are tribal;readers are tribal. We like to read about characters who reflect us becauseit’s a way we can learn how to deal with life and its challenges. Queer readershad been mentally editing / head-editing the novels they read for years,changing one character or another’s sex in their minds. Highly unsatisfying—andtotally beside the point of queer existence.The roots of modern queer literary themes can be found inclassical mythology. Some of the gods enjoyed emotionally close relationshipswith male pals, for whom they would kill or commit vengeful mayhem. Apollo,especially, was quite close with Carnus, Hyacinth, and Cyparissus. Herakles (orHercules) cared deeply for Aberdus, Hylas, and especially Iolaus, who helped Herculesprevail against the multi-headed Hydra.Moving forward in time we find the Satyricon (1st century A.D.), a fictitious work by theRoman courtier Gaius Petronius, and TheTale of Genji (11th century) by Murasaki Shikibu. These worksincluded frank depictions of male/male relationships, after which queer themesmore or less went underground—that is, they were disguised or hidden in storyelements, for centuries. An example can be found in Dracula (1897) by Bram Stoker, when Count Dracula seizes JonathanHarker with the cry, “This man belongs to me!” In the seafaring novel Billy Budd, begun in the late 1800s byHerman Melville and first published in 1924, there’s a possible homosexualtriangle involving Billy, Claggart, and Captain Vere.Queers hunting for a literary hero might have come acrossOscar Wilde (1854-1900). You found a career of literary talent andaccomplishment, but then you looked into his life, and wow. “Gross indecency,”they called it. Prison time, they gave him. He died penniless.Women interested in exploring same-sex relationships had tolook harder, and there wasn’t much to find. You had the fragmentary poetry ofSappho (c. 630-570 B.C.). Maybe you came across Radclyffe Hall’sdepressingly-titled The Well ofLoneliness (1928), wherein the main character, Stephen Gordon (a woman), isarguably suicidal by the end, though she doesn’t quite get around to itonscreen, as it were.Then maybe you read about Gertrude Stein and Alice B.Toklas, guardians of the Paris avant-garde in the Jazz Age. Well, what was thatrelationship about? Hm. Super hard to tell. Then you read Ernest Hemingway’s A Moveable Feast and you came across alittle passage of dialogue that appears to record an overheard quarrel betweentwo lady perverts. Great. Just great.Sadly, due to cultural standards and expectations—we wereall mentally ill, remember?—the queer characters had to die, or more ideally,kill themselves out of shame. Lovely.A few examples out of hundreds:Carmilla (1871-72), the title character in Joseph SheridanLe Fanu’s serially-published novel;Martha Dobie in TheChildren’s Hour (1934), play by Lillian Hellmann;Sebastian Venable in SuddenlyLast Summer (1958), play by Tennessee Williams (among other Williamscharacters who get killed off or at least humiliated for being different);Brig Anderson in Adviseand Consent (1959), novel by Allen Drury.In mid-century American queer literature, Tennessee Williamskeeps cropping up, especially with his play Caton a Hot Tin Roof (1955). The gorgeous character Brick doesn’t love hiswife, the equally gorgeous Maggie—why not? There was this guy, this footballteammate of Brick’s named Skipper. Brick and Skipper. Something there. Butwhat, exactly? Maybe even they didn’t know. Skipper killed himself. OK, yeah. Readbetween the lines, friend.Many good writers wrote closeted—about sexually ambiguouscharacters, with some between-the-lines stuff in there. Truman Capote and his Other Voices, Other Rooms (1948) mightbe an example. Patricia Highsmith edged into queer themes with her series offive books (1955-1991) featuring the character Tom Ripley, who appears to atleast be bisexual, if not homosexual. She wrote a frankly queer-themed novel, The Price of Salt (1952) early in hercareer, but under the pseudonym Claire Morgan.Contemporary queer lit is inextricably tied to the gay pridemovement that ignited with the Stonewall uprising in New York City in 1969,named after the bar where members of the queer community rebelled against thepolice, who routinely raided such places and racked up arrests on ‘indecency’charges and other crimes. Stonewall was a watershed moment that led to the LGBTrights movement.Rights were fought for, rights were gradually won, andqueers could come out a little more. There we were, blinking in the sunlight.More visibility meant more opportunity to get queer literature out there.[End of excerpt.

{"title": "Bald Patches", "date": "Thursday, January 3, 2019", "text": "Zestful Blog Post #297[I constructed the following story from usages and spellingsI found while browsing on Reddit. If you’re not familiar with Reddit, it is thecurrent most interesting social media platform, and happens to be populatedlargely by guys in their teens and 20s.]I was watching the playoffs when an ad came on for some newcar. The main person in the ad was a famous movie star who has turned intonothing but a corporate shrill. You know who I’m talking about: stalky build,wearing a sole patch, which are so last week, right? His last picture was areal dousey, take my word for it. I do recall when it came out, I made a B-linefor the theater because I use to think he was cool. Before I got there, though,I stopped at an ATM machine to get money to buy a ticket, but I forgot my PINnumber. After racking my brain for like 10 minutes, I remembered it. Later, Iwrote my PIN number on my ATM card as a preventative measure against forgettingit again.Let me just tell you about that movie, which starts with agrizzly crime where some guy stabs a college sorodity girl because she wouldn’tgo out with him. It all seemed realistic, so I figured the movie wouldn’t be tobad. It seems the killer’s mom tried to reign him in, but she was a baffoon, andjust couldn’t control him. She must have weighed 100 pounds soak and wet. Plusshe didn’t understand her son very well and what he was up against in this fastpace, doggy-dog world we live in. The murderer keeps leaching off his mom,borrowing money to buy drugs, even while the cops are figuring out who did it.There’s another friend who tries to ween him off the drugs with no success.The hero cop starts to hone in on where this guy lives,which is a coldasack at the end of a long street of nice houses. They intercepta message that the murderer sends to the government, trying to black male them intopaying money to stop a bomb or something. This doosh thinks he’s going to pickup a fortune from the government to keep him from blowing up a kindergarden. Thenthere was something about too much partizenship in the government, but Isomewhat lost track. I almost walked out of the show at this point, but Iwanted to be polight to the ticket-taker whose this really pretty girl who wasin my art class and who told me she highly reckon mended it. I use to be scaredof talking to her, but now that I’m more mature, it was EZ-PZ. By the way, haveI ever mentioned I’m a conasuer of movie-theater popcorn? Even though I’m lacktoast and tolerant, I can eat movie popcorn because there’s not real butter onit, but it tastes like it. Another words, sometimes fake can be good.OK, so somehow the cop figures out that the killer and hissquad car partner are one in the same. A bunch of other stuff happens in aworld wind of action, with the proverbeal apoclyeptic shoot out. Plus thekiller cops’ mom commits sewer-side because she’s so sad and blames herself.That’s as much as I can remember.I told the pretty ticket-taker Noah fence, but I don’t agreewith your feelings about the movie. She was cool about it. Maybe we should getmarried. I’m a pretty funny guy. Wouldn’t it be hirlaous if I asked her and shesaid yes?Did you like this story?

{"title": "Working Without a Net", "date": "Thursday, December 27, 2018", "text": "Zestful Blog Post #296One day when I was a little kid, I was feeding my buddingmorbid fascination by looking at pictures in LIFE magazine of a terrible accidentinvolving the Flying Wallendas. They were a circus high-wire act, theirbreathtaking finale being a seven-person pyramid on the wire, with no safetynet. During a performance in Detroit, my hometown, one of the performers losthis balance and the pyramid collapsed, killing two and paralyzing another. Mymother, passing by, remarked, “You know, you’re related to them.”I was dumbfounded, but no more information was forthcoming.Eventually I learned a little more about the alleged connection, on my father’sside of the family. Which helps explain how easily he would jump up and grabthe clothes pole in the backyard and flip himself over it, then sling himselfdown with complete gracefulness: had to be genetic, right? Many times I’vethought about the Wallendas, especially in recent years when seventh-generationNik Wallenda made huge, net-free crossings of places like Niagara Falls and theGrand Canyon.And I think about doing things that are risky, and aboutwriting, and about working without a net. When you don’t have a net, you haveto pay better attention. If you fall, you can take others down with you. Thiscould promote fear and over-caution if we let it.[The disaster unfolds. Photo by Don Sudnik]Because to be honest, comfort zones have value. Withoutsome level of comfort, you won’t consider taking a risk at all. It’s just thatif we build up too much safety, too much comfort, the comfort zone can become acocoon that becomes a coffin. Much of the nets we build are illusions anyway.As you can see, I haven’t fully figured this stuff out.Specific ways to work without a net:- Writing outside your genre / trying something totally new.- Writing about family members or close friends.- Writing outside your sex / race / socio-economic level.- Making your writing public: There’s no net, nowhere tohide when anybody can post a review of your work.What are the rewards? Working without a net can besalubrious to one’s heart and guts. Nets take away the danger, and the pointis, danger is part of the art. This is a huge thing that many artists spendtheir lives trying to deny. Then there’s the fact that a net can hurt you too:The Wallendas worked without one because if you fall, you can bounce off thenet and fatally hit your head on the nearby concrete. (As one Wallenda did,before the Detroit disaster.)Self-publishing is a lot like walking the wire without anet. If you quit your publisher, or your publisher quits you, do you run backto the platform, or do you keep walking the wire on your own? Will anybodyrespond to this writing?When Nik Wallenda was on the wire above the Grand Canyon,the wind shifted, and he was buffeted. The wind is like the zeitgeist. It canshift, and it probably will shift, and we will be buffeted. We shrug and go on.Is the bottom line really that there are no nets? There isno such thing as complete security, much as we might wish for it. The key to writingwell (and of course the key to life) is to embrace the risk, let it all hangout, and accept the outcome wholeheartedly. Only by accepting risk (while notbeing reckless), can truly extraordinary art come out.What do you think? To post, click below where it says, ‘NoComments,’ or ‘2 Comments,’ or whatever.

{"title": "Your Pair of Swans", "date": "Thursday, December 20, 2018", "text": "Zestful Blog Post #295One day a few months ago, a pair of swans (pictured below) appearedin the pond across from our upstairs window. We were like, WTF? That is socool! We began watching the huge gorgeous birds avidly as we got ready for ourday. Marcia, particularly, was enchanted, and set out to know how the swans gotthere.After some sleuthing, she learned that our neighbors acrossthe way (strangers to us) decided they wanted swans. Their house backs up tothe pond, which is the property of a golf course. Our houses border the course.The neighbors checked with the golf course management and the local vigilante—er,homeowner—associations, who all said, hey sure, swans would be cool! So theyordered their swans from whatever swan ranch, set up a care plan for them, andare looking after them.The swans glide around and nibble the vegetation and smallcritters like worms and mollusks in the pond, which has a couple of islets inthe middle. The neighbors set up a little swan shelter, which looks like anupside-down playpen, on shore for when they want shade. Early every morning, oneof the neighbors brings out a red bucket and puts out some swan chow(presumably to ensure adequate nutrition in addition to what might be availablefrom the pond). The swans come up and have breakfast, then they go back to thepond and its various social activities. Ducks, herons, grebes, ospreys, and otherspecies enjoy the habitat too. Side note: reportedly, swans will chase offtroublesome geese that like to hog all the food in a small pond.[MerryChristmas, if you celebrate it, and/or happy holidays to you from Marcia and me—andthe swans.]We enjoy the show in the mornings. And we have learned thatif you have the proper space and about $2,500 and you want a pair of White MuteSwans, well by God, you can have them. The deeper truth is hey, what would makeyou happy? Admittedly, not everyone is equipped to afford and care for a pairof swans. But is there something that would bring you joy, for the hell of it? Haveyou gotten into the habit of thinking it’s just not within reach, or even practical?Perhaps now is the time to challenge that thought.

{"title": "Exploitation Works", "date": "Thursday, December 13, 2018", "text": "Zestful Blog Post #294Exploitation WorksExploitation is a thing, and it can be used. I wrote about this a few years ago, but want to give you some more specifics here. There aresuccessful authors who appeal to the deepest-held beliefs / prejudices /yearnings of their audiences, once they’ve found them. Exploitation feeds on andencourages the time-honored us-versus-them dynamic. That’s not a comfortabledynamic for everyone all the time, but it resonates somewhere in every humanheart.A simple example might be a young adult book wherein abrave, outrageous cadre of students overthrows the mean old teachers, showingthem they’re not so smart. The teachers learn from the students! Something thatdoesn’t often follow is the answer to the question: Now will the new rulers bekindly overlords? George Orwell’s AnimalFarm explored this question, and as we might remember, things don’t look sogreat at the end of the story, which is a new beginning for the animals on thefarm.Exploitative stories often rely on stereotypes, whichthemselves represent a fascinating subtopic. To whom does the stereotypical meanRepublican appeal? A hardcore Democrat might say, “That’s no stereotype! That’ssimply reality!” To whom does the strong-but-dumb boyfriend stereotype appeal?How about the lazy immigrant? The suffering artist? The kind-hearted criminal?The trigger-happy cop? The angry-yet-somehow-perfect-in-every-way revolutionary?It’s not by accident that more male readers enjoy (and buy) thrillerswith strong, brave protagonists who win in the end. Not by accident that morewomen like romances where the plucky protagonist gets the handsome swashbucklerin the end. With a big, perfect wedding.Novelists, filmmakers, religious leaders, andpoliticians have learned exploitation works. It’s button-pushing, and for whatit is, it can be effective. There is, of course, the danger of exploitationbackfiring on you, making you seem like a vindictive, unimaginative boob.[Ivan was definitely Terrible]But seriously, look closely at the novels you read andsee if you can figure out where the exploitation is. Not all of it isheavy-handed; you can find subtle examples all over the place, and you canlearn from them. Key into your emotions as you read: Why does some character orplot twist appeal to you? Why does another make you uncomfortable?Our challenge as authors is to reject cheap, obvious exploitation,but embrace the good kind! Don’t be afraid to be conscious of what you’redoing; don’t be afraid to calculate. We want to dive deep to engage—and,really, control—our readers’ emotions. The best way to do this is get to knowyour characters really well. Respect them, and look for their complexity anddepth. Then think deeply about your ideal reader.Is your ideal reader a 40-year-old divorced airline pilot?Well, you can certainly create a main character who happens to be a 40-year-olddivorced airline pilot. Wouldn’t just about any guy or gal like that want to bea hero in the air? Yes! It’s easy. You don’t have to make your pilot bring downthe plane safely while killing all the bad guys with a ballpoint pen, but youmight make your pilot do something hard and satisfying, like navigate around amountain in the fog without instruments. (Can pilots do that? I don’t know, butyou’ll research it.) And hey, your ideal reader might have a secret desire todo something really bad—like enter the underworld of drug smuggling. Well, yourcharacter can do that, and you will make sure they’re supremely successful atit! You can dream up all kinds of good ideas from this perspective.Play matchmaker between your readers and your characters! Beshrewd! Make exploitation work for you. Your readers will love you for it.What do you think? To post, click below where it says, ‘NoComments,’ or ‘2 Comments,’ or whatever.

{"title": "Your Whole Self", "date": "Thursday, December 6, 2018", "text": "Zestful Blog Post #293A few weeks ago Marcia and I went to the local medieval fairand enjoyed ourselves thoroughly. We stopped to watch one of the games, whereyou slam a steel pad with a sledgehammer to make a heavy slug ride up avertical rail. The harder you hit it, the higher the slug flies, the chief goalbeing to make the slug strike the bell at the top, producing a ringing soundthat attracts the attention of all nearby, who gaze admiringly at absolutestrength personified. You buy five tries for a dollar or a shilling or a peckof meal or whatever. A young teenager was trying. He really wanted to hit thatbell, but kept falling short. The bearded, leather-jerkin-wearing man runningthe game advised him, “Squat as you bring the hammer down.” He did so. Magic. Ding!It was just like splitting firewood when we lived in the forest.After experimenting with various methods, I found that iron wedges and a smallsledge worked best and safest for me. (Just a hatchet for splitting kindling.) Youset the round you want to split on end, on your splitting stump, and you find acrack near the edge and tap in your wedge. And if you do it enough, you learn thatsetting your legs apart, then swinging the sledge over your head and straightbehind your back, then bringing it down on the wedge with a fluid squattingmove, results in the most force. Crack!We moved along and watched the axe-throwing game. Some axesbounced off the plank targets downrange, and some stuck with a satisfying thunk. I asked a young woman who hadjust stuck two axes in a row what the trick was. “Step into the throw,” shesaid, then turned away, rared back, and stepped into another throw. Thunk.For the games and wood-splitting, the secret of success wasto fully commit. Put your whole self into it. Leave the familiar world behind.We remember learning to ride a two-wheeler, where you had torelinquish a certain amount of control in order to get the thing going. It washard to make the commitment to take both feet off the ground and pump thosepedals, but the concrete sidewalk was a good motivator, wasn’t it? Beingtentative was lethal. Once you were under way, you gained a different kind of control, and you werezooming along in a completely new environment, separated from ordinary gravityby the unfamiliar miracle of gyroscopic force. And every time you got on yourbike from then on, you learned to minimize the length of time you were liableto fall over. You learned to get those pedals going smartly, just as soon asyou push off. You learned to commit, and put your whole self into it.Aren’t so many more things like that: Ziplining. Striking amatch. Getting on the school bus. Releasing an arrow. Saying, “I do.” Writing astory.What do you think? To post, click below where it says, ‘NoComments,’ or ‘2 Comments,’ or whatever.

We know that, and we prove it to ourselves over and over.Which do you remember better, the sequence of events surrounding the stolengold in The Adventures of HuckleberryFinn, or the feeling Huck and Jim had for each other? (If you’re sittingthere thinking, “What stolen gold?”, then I rest my case and can knock offearly for a beverage and a snack.)Katherine Anne Porter said, “The only thing I know aboutpeople is exactly what I have learned from the people right next to me.” Sheknew that to write about people, we have to pay attention to them....and there they all are...But dammit, we don’t have to like people. Liking has nothing to do with it. All we needto be is fascinated by people. Awed by people. Horrified by people. Inspiredby people. And not just so we can portray them convincingly. Because throughpeople, other people, and through creating and writing about characters, wefind out things about ourselves. We explore and nourish ourselves.

But most of these items arefrom writers I’ve encountered at events at Ringling College of Art and Design,as well as conferences and meetings in the last six months or so. Some are fromme, and some you’ve no doubt heard from others before, especially this firstone:·      Don’t overthink it. (Don’t we all love that?)·      Longer passages of quick dialogue can do twothings:o  Make for plentiful white space on the page,which is easy to read; ando  Take up pages in a printed book, making it lookmeatier than it might be. (Heh-heh.)·      Time spent getting to know your characters on adeep level is time well spent.·      It’s hard to make money as an author.·      Some authors make great money. The foolproof how-toformula is unclear.·      It’s easy to get published.·      It’s hard to get published.[Gotta climb ev'ry mountain...]·      Social media sucks and does nothing for yourcareer.·      Social media is great and can help your career alot.·      One gets lonely.·      Collaborating with other authors (writing bookswith them) can be:o  Fraught with icky drama, making you not want todo it anymore, like when somebody else claims credit for your idea, just thesame as in other group projects we’ve all dealt with.o  Really great, especially if it’s just one otherperson you like and trust.·      Most of us are too uptight.·      You should stick with one genre and make a namethere.·      Experiment widely in different genres if youfeel like it; you never know when you’ll hit it big with some new thing.·      A pseudonym can jump-start your career in a newdirection.·      To write a good action scene, such as a fight:o  Give a quick overview, theno  Get into some deep detail, theno  Pull back again to the ‘long shot,’ so to speak.o  Rinse and repeat.·      Every one of us is walking—or running, orplunging, or staggering—along a different path. No two careers are exactlyalike.·      Therefore I say: Let’s trust our own paths,rocks and wrong turns and all. Because we’re getting somewhere. And sometimes the view is great.What do you think?

{"title": "The Climbing Rope", "date": "Thursday, November 8, 2018", "text": "Zestful Blog Post #289Backin elementary school I was neither the first nor last kid picked for teams; Iwas unathletic enough to not be chosen first, but popular enough not to bechosen last. Gosh, remember when we did that? I understand these days theydon't let kids choose up sides, because of self-esteem. Gym was OK except forone dreadful piece of equipment: the climbing rope.Therope, a hairy hemp freighter hawser thicker than an eight-year-old's thigh,started in a knot at waist level, then ascended nearly out of view, affixed tothe ceiling two storeys up.Everygym session, the teacher would tell us to line up and take turns climbing therope. Success, of course, was measured by how far you climbed. Kids who made itall the way to the top, daringly slapping the iron swivel, then slidingdramatically down like firefighters or sailors, were like gods to me. (Oh, itwas safe! The teacher dragged a small gym mat under the rope!)Icouldn't climb the thing at all. Not one inch. When my turn came, I'd sigh andtake hold of the rope and try to pull myself up. I just couldn't do it. I hadthe desire to do it, but when Ipulled with my hands, nothing happened. I hung there like a grape until theteacher, a loose-jowled guy who wore loafers and dress pants, would say 'next' ina bored voice.Asan adult, I'd wonder about that rope now and then. The breakthrough came when Iwas being weekend-lazy, watching an old Tarzan movie on TV. By God, there itwas: Tarzan grabbed that vine and climbed it, and he used not just his arms but his legs too. He didn't clasp that vine inhis hands, he hugged it. And hewrapped his legs around it and bent them like a frog's, then, pinching the vinewith his legs, sort of stood up. He regripped the vine with his arms, froggedhis legs up again, and kept going. (To the admiring gazes of Jane and Boy.)AndI remembered that the kids who made it to the top looked just like Tarzan. Whydidn't I see it at the time? Why didn't I copy the other kids? I’m sure mykinetic sense wasn't very good then, and my brain wasn’t fully developed either.If the teacher—or even another kid—had broken down the moves for me, showed meand explained it to me verbally, step-by-step, I probably could have done it. Iwasn't much punier than the other kids.Thenext opportunity I had to climb a rope like that—not that such opportunitiescome by every day—I grabbed the thing, hugged it, wrapped my leg around it,and—went up!Thisis how I feel about aspiring authors and story development. Thousands uponthousands of stories start with a cool nugget of an idea. And then they hangthere.Butthe truth is, story development—getting from cool idea to fully formed story ornarrative—isn't a mysterious endowment. It isn't a you-have-it-or-you-don'tthing, like leprosy or royal lineage. Just like rope climbing, storydevelopment is a skill that can be learned and improved. And it’s simple: Allyou need to do is look closely at how successful authors do it, and realizethat they’re showing you, right there on the page. Study up. Read without haste.Make notes. Ask and answer questions like:·       How does the author move from theopening into the first conflict?·       Who are the major characters?·       How does each character—major orminor—serve the plot?·       Is anything there for no reason? Ormaybe I need to look closer?·       What is the author trying to tell mehere, and here, and here?·       How can I copy this?Workwith what you see, and with what you seek.What do you think?

Someone alive or not, doesn't matter.What about that person is inspiring? Did they accomplish something remarkable?Did they behave admirably under extraordinary strain? What resources do yousuppose they drew on to perform as they did? Physical strength? Inner courage?Endurance? Faith? Perhaps it was even humility. Because to be kind and lovingwhen others are not requires the courage of humility: the willingness to beseen as wrong or bad. Conjure the spirit of your hero.

{"title": "A Few Fast How-Tos and a Book by a Pal", "date": "Thursday, October 25, 2018", "text": "Zestful Blog Post #287How to deal with nothaving read the authors you meet.First of all, nobody reads everybody. Upon meeting anotherauthor whom you haven't read, say, \"So wonderful to meet you! I've heardgreat things about your work!\" That's it. Don't overdo it.If you need to make convo with someone for an extendedperiod, such as being seated together at a lunch or dinner, you can say,\"You know, I'm afraid I really don't know your work, but I've love to hearhow you got started.\"If it’s a trad-published author, you can ask, “Do you likeyour agent?” Every author who has representation is curious about every otherauthor's agent. How to be a happy tyrant.Demand the utmost from your characters. You are bothcomposer and conductor! Sometimes, during a demanding passage under an exactingbaton, musicians strain so hard to deliver the effects asked for that they snapa string or blow their lips out of shape.Only by going to the limit, and risking going past it, andsuffering whatever damage might be the penalty, will we find out if what wethought was our limit is really that.We can only discover new strengths by exhausting the oldones.How to avoid aheadbanging mistake.If you have an opportunity to do a live event like a booksigningand they want to know good dates for you, look ahead on line and find when thenext Olympics and major sporting events are going to be. Try not to scheduleanything during the Olympics, the Super Bowl, Presidential election night, or,come to think of it, the soccer World Cup final sequence. The World Series ishit-and-miss (ha, I just made a pun), and not as much of a ratings draw as theother things. Kentucky Derby, I guess if you live in Kentucky.I'll always hold grudges against Sarah Hughes, IrinaSlutskaya, and Michelle Kwan for making nobody come to my booksigning event inSan Francisco on the night of the women's Olympic figure skating finals in 2002.And now for a word about a book by a buddy. Congratulationsto Jim Misko on his multi-prizewinning novel.From the cover:Miles Foster is a newlyminted teacher who dreams of getting a teaching job in the highly respected andfinancially stable Portland, Oregon school system where everything isavailable, and where he and his wife call home. But the only opening for histalents is in a remote lumber mill town in central Oregon, two hundred milesaway. It is a poor school with forty students, and is controlled by a jealoussuperintendent and school board who tolerate no thinking outside the box andwho conspire to destroy his teaching career.Miles must find a way to educate students whohave been passed along regardless of what they learned, and defeat the damagingcontrol of the school board and superintendent without losing his marriage orhis job, or both.Buy it HERE.What do you think of today’s how-tos?

{"title": "Book Thieves", "date": "Thursday, October 18, 2018", "text": "Zestful Blog Post #286I bet some of you remember Steal This Book by Abbie Hoffman, a counterculture guide that cameout in 1971. I bought a copy, which tells you something about my ethics then.However, I did read it avidly and, being an impressionable youth, wished I hadthe guts to try some of Hoffman’s ideas for ‘sticking it to the man,’ likedemanding my free buffalo from the federal government, or pretending I washungry and broke to get food from trusting churches. Some of the stuff in itseemed just stupid to me, though, like pasting a postpaid piece of junk mail toa brick and dropping it in a mailbox so whatever corporation had to pay thepostage due. Another uncomfortable one was going into a busy restaurant andeating leftover food before the tables get cleared. Ew. Not that I've led a shame-free life.I worked in bookselling for ten years in the 1980sand 90s, first as a floor clerk (in a bookstore owned by two brothers named Tomand Louis Borders), then as a manager and regional executive. Lots of people would come in and steal books. Wehad a pretty good idea of how many books we lost to shrink (the retaileuphemism) because once a year, we'd do a physical inventory count. You comparethe stuff you have on hand with the list of stuff that's supposed to be in thestore, and the difference is shrink, or shrinkage. We lost a lot of inventory.It was rare to catch a thief in the act. We had nosecurity staff or hidden cameras. Furthermore, it was assumed that staff wouldnot steal, especially since everybody got $25 worth of store credit everymonth, plus a 25% discount on everything. What can I say? Borders, in thosedays, was a small company in the Midwest. And I think very few employees stole;giving stuff away to employees is a good way to create good will. When thecompany got big, financial experts came in and convinced top management to takeaway store credit, and the employee discount went down to 10%, if I rememberright. (Members of the corporate board of directors got 25%, which as you mightimagine went over great with the rank and file.) Stores also got primitivesecurity systems, which at first were a joke, then got somewhat better. [A look at my home sports-and-leisure, nature, and reference sections.]Scammers would try many tricks, from trying toreturn stolen books for cash, to paying with bad checks, to claiming to havelost a gift certificate to fire, pet digestion, or other imaginative mishap.The vast majority of thieves got away. But once ina while, staff would spot somebody and realize they weren't a legitimatecustomer. There was one guy who focused on the computer book section. Pound forpound, computer books tended to be higher-priced, and they were easy to sell toused-bookstores. This fellow would appear to be browsing the low bookcases,taking a few books off the shelf, then he'd dip down into a squat where he washidden from view. Then he'd rise up, empty-handed but bulkier around themiddle, and hustle out the door to his car.I didn't have the nerve to confront the guy (andby the time I could get the police there he'd have been long gone), but I didfollow him to his car after I clearly saw him steal. I made sure he saw me,made sure he knew I knew, and watched him go, writing down his license platenumber. Never saw him again.More shocking to me were the employees who didsteal. We caught one guy, who had worked out a system of hiding books behindempty boxes in the back receiving hall. Come time to clock out, he'd leave thestore via the back way, collect his booty, and walk around to the parking lotfrom the alley. It was too cute, and another staffer figured out what he wasdoing and turned him in.Come to think of it, I have a bunch of otherstories about book thieves, and maybe I’ll write them down for a future post.Although it's never right to steal, you canunderstand why a hungry person would steal or cheat for food. But books, youcan take them home for free from the library, or you can sit and read themright in the store.Then we come up to ‘today,’ meaning post-digital-publishing-revolution,and we have book pirates. That term makes them seem somehow romantic, likemodern-day Robin Hoods. In fact, they are scum. I subscribe to an anti-pirateservice called Blasty,which searches for and somehow removes from search engines websites claiming tohave my books downloadable for free. It doesn’t take down the sites or sendcease-and-desist letters, but I think what they do is just about as good.I’ve found that most of these pirate sites are merelyphishing holes. For instance, if you want a free copy of The Actress, click here and enter a bunch of your personalinformation: your contact info, and hey, if you keep clicking through they’llask for your credit card number, just as a precaution to secure your account,and hey, they won’t actually charge anything on it. I guess some people fallfor all that. And of course they don’t have a digital copy of the book to giveyou anyway. Come back tomorrow. If Abbie Hoffman were alive today, I’ve nodoubt he would learn code and try to be a hacker. But he committed suicide in1989, partly because he was no longer under 30. Look it up if you don’t believeme.I don’t worry too much about these pirate sites,because if somebody wants to download my book for free, that doesn’tnecessarily mean they would have bought it otherwise. Lots of enraged authorsmiss this point. So somebody gets to read your book for free, and maybe they’dlike more, and maybe they’ll eventually buy something. You can’t get too workedup about this stuff.But in conclusion, book pirates are scum.What do you think? Do you have a book theft/piracy story?

{"title": "You're All Right", "date": "Thursday, October 11, 2018", "text": "Zestful Blog Post #285I knew a woman who made it her life’s work to becomeunblocked. To realize her potential. When I met her she was middle-aged, divorced,with two grown kids and a rucksack full of dreams waiting to come true.But somewhere along the line she’d decided—or agreed withsome shrink or shaman or dead parent—that the way she was wasn’t right enough.She ought not to act on those dreams until she’d gotten herself right.She occupied herself with all sorts of things toself-actualize, to ‘awaken her inner artist’ or something, to figure out whatshe really should be doing, to free up, to become worthy. To become who shewas. Perhaps she should sign on as an animal research assistant and observe beautifulcreatures in far-flung habitats. Perhaps she should take flying lessons and tryto get a job as a cargo pilot. Or perhaps she should write a novel. Fine. She died at age 52 of ovarian cancer before the process wascomplete. I sadly suspect she could have lived until 102 and still nevercompleted her process of ‘becoming.’I say, screw becoming.Screw preparing. Be and do. The being and the doing will make all processingmoot. Screaming at an effigy of your mother in the woods, taking ice baths orfirewalks? You could. But only living freely—with openness to mistakes andcrappy results—will make us live well. And only writing freely—with openness tomistakes and crappy results—will make us write well.It is so very simple.What do you think?

{"title": "Old-School Tech Tests", "date": "Thursday, October 4, 2018", "text": "Zestful Blog Post #284This beefy post is the first part of a feature I wrote forWriter’s Digest magazine's November/December 2018 issue, themed ‘the throwbackissue.’ I believe it’s hitting subscriber mailboxes now; should be onnewsstands now or soon. I had a great time writing this, and have already heardhappy comments from enthusiastic readers who write.[Excerpt begins]I’m an analogue girl in a digital world. I like old thingsand old style. I used a rotary-dial phone until the march of progress threatenedto crush us both. My car just celebrated its twenty-fourth birthday. I like canvassneakers, gin martinis, and homemade afghans.But I’m a writer in contemporary times, and I’ve adapted tonew technologies. Frankly, most of it has been a blur. I do remember, though,sitting alone at night in an office building sometime in the 1980s, watching myboss’s printer slowly excrete 200 pages of random ASCII characters. For all Iknew, the computer was trying to tell us something. I sent the pages to the techguys at headquarters for analysis. They still haven’t gotten back to me.Fast-forward to now, when miniature microphones and voice-to-textsoftware literally enable us to write as fast as we can talk. I understand thenext phase is nearly upon us, where a machine will write my novels for me. And nodoubt publish them, collect royalties, and spend the money on nice things for itself.But I feel it’s time to ask: Is more tech necessarilybetter? Is faster better than slower? Is more output worthier than less? Is thedestination more important than the journey?With those questions in mind, I took it upon myself toinvestigate. To re-immerse myself in the materials and sensations I used to enjoyso often—and also to experiment with even older methods—I spent a weekendworking on my current novel using an assortment of technology that originatedbetween the building of the Sphinx and opening night of “My Fair Lady.”On Saturday morning, I settled down at my writing table, amug of coffee at my side and a wood-cased pencil in my hand. I chose a Blackwing602, known for its smooth core and fragrant cedar casing. (I’d decided to skipinscribing words on stone or wet clay tablets and start with the next writingtechnology most closely related to those, graphite.)Pencil sharpening is an act of beginning. You sit down, yougather yourself, you sharpen. You feel and hear the sharpener working—whether acranker or handheld—and you smell that fresh wood. You behold your newlyexposed graphite. If the point is sharp, you feel brief anxiety over whether themicroscopic conical top section will break off as you touch it to paper.I enjoy the deliberateness of the pencil experience. As youwrite, the point degrades to whatever degree of dullness you feel liketolerating. You rotate the point to take advantage of the wear pattern—everyrotation offers a sharper edge.When you write with a pencil, you are in a very real sense,drawing. You’re laying down the two-dimensional images of words. You can writelittle or big; with light pressure or hard; you can print carefully or racealong in whatever version of cursive is yours.You can erase mistakes! But if you’re on a tear, you can juststrike through with vigor and keep going. Or you can flurry down a satisfying stormof obliterating zigzags. The re-sharpening pause is a balm. While sharpening,you have a chance to look up, change the focal length of your gaze, quitthinking for a moment, and use your hands differently.I wrote about a thousand words with the Blackwing 602, savoringits straightforward sturdiness. You don’t have to baby a pencil; you can leaveit lying around; you can even lose it without too much grief. You can write withit in a canoe or on a mountain ledge, or upside-down while lying in bed. Noworries about ink, mechanisms, batteries.The assortment. Mid-morning, I skipped ahead in time and unholstered mytrusty plastic Pentel automatic, with a .7mm lead, in the relatively soft andbold 2B grade I like. The obvious advantage of the automatic pencil is nosharpening, no bother. You click a button or twist the barrel to advance yourlead, and you can write fast and precise. The writing experience is lessvaried, though. That’s the price you pay.With any pencil, one must bring some pressure to bear, whichputs wear and tear on you. My writing elbow got sore after a few hours ofpencil work.After lunch I turned to a group of instruments you have todip in ink, that marvelous liquid humans first concocted in Neolithic times. Hollowreeds served as writing tools in ancient Egypt, China, and the Middle East.They’re still used for drawing and special calligraphy.I’d found a reed pen in my art box, so I started with that.It was a seven-inch-long wand about half an inch in diameter and cut to a quill-likepoint. I opened a bottle of black Noodler’s ink, dipped the reed in, andstarted writing. I blobbed too much ink down at first, then got the hang ofmaking bold strokes.I had to reload with ink every few words, however. Becauseof that, and apart from the novelty, the experience was wearying and just notpractical. I perceived how a fine reed with an expertly-done point—and ahalfway experienced scribe—could work some beauty.Writing with a quill didn’t go much better. I’d found alarge feather during a walk a few years ago and saved it. Now, following anonline tutorial, I made a writing point from its shaft. Like the reed, thequill emitted an ugly blot before scratchily producing a contiguous line. Afterabout ten words, it ran dry. I reloaded and kept going, but the work wentslowly and vexingly. Thinking about the fact that Shakespeare wrote all of hisplays with such an instrument made me nearly sick with pity. But life wasslower then, and I think everybody had more patience.[This is the end of the excerpt.

{"title": "Zuh Cow", "date": "Thursday, September 27, 2018", "text": "Zestful Blog Post #283Some of my favorite imperishable quotations are from people’sgrandparents. My friend Linda was musing on wisdom from her German grandmother:“Linda. Linda. If you dun’t learn to milk zuh cow, you dun’t haff to milk zuh cow.”Think about it. Not learning something excuses youfrom dealing with it, and that can be liberating. I mean, I’ve watched cowsbeing milked by hand. Sometimes they smack you in the face with their damp, urine-scentedtail. Good morning!Cunningly avoiding learning how to do somethingcan indeed be liberating. Most grandmas are not stupid. But being helpless, weknow, can also backfire: Beyond not being able to get milk when you want it, thinkof all the young executives in the ’70s and ’80s who resolutely refused tolearn how to type. Ambitious women especially were warned away from learninghow to type, because typing was for assistants. If you typed, you werepigeonholed into a subservient role. That was the thinking. But then—“Wuh-oh.What’s this new computer thingy on my desk? It gots a keyboard! Wuh-oh!” We hada generation of executives who were clumsy on the keyboard and therefore inefficientbecause they didn’t learn to touch-type with all ten fingers. I mentioned acouple of years ago here that one of the best things I ever did was take a typingclass in high school with a scary bastard perfectionist teacher. I use typinghere just as an example. It could be plunging a clogged sink, sewing on abutton, starting a campfire, reading a paper map for God’s sake, even pumpinggas.Do we want to be dependent on others? Sometimes,hell yeah. But it’s a game of subtlety and judgment. Grownups deal withwhatever shit they really have to. I think Linda’s grandma really meant: Figureout what you really want in life, and screw everything else, because life’s tooshort to get slapped in the face by a cow.What do you think?

Congratulations to Bev Prescott and Neil Plakcy.In the year2092, climate change has transformed the face of Earth. Storms, disease,famine, thirst and war show no mercy on the living. Sharon Clausen, aself-reliant farmer, has a secret apple tree—a tree that keeps Sharon and herwife, Eve, fed. The only other people who know of her secret, or so shethinks, is Dr. Ryan, a long-time confidant, and his wife, Areva. Once a month,Sharon and Eve travel from Maine to Boston to trade apples with Dr. Ryan forEve’s leukemia treatment. Everything suddenly changes when Eve is kidnapped andthe Ryans are murdered.

(Have you donesomething for the hell of it this week yet?) I swear if you do this you will writeabout your world with greater confidence and pleasure. Even reading this will help you.Go to your favorite coffeehouse and sit with your notebook.Relax your jaw. Which should prompt your neck to relax. Which should promptyour shoulders to relax, and so on down. You’re welcome. Without moving from that spot, write down everything you cansense. Open all those chakras or whatever they are and write down what you'reseeing and sensing, head to toe. Don’t judge anything, just describe it.What do you see? Start with the place and write it. Floor,walls, ceiling. What do you see through the windows? Is it day or night? What isthe quality of the light—is it bright, muted, pearly, golden? Maybe it's blue,or maroon! Look into the shadows. Notice how different the light is there.Describe it. What do you hear? What's playing on the sound system, if anything?Is it loud or quiet? Do you know the tune?Next, the people. Who's there and what are they like? Whatdo they look like, what clothing? Who's talking and what are they saying? Whatare their voices like? What else do you hear? Doors banging open and shut as peoplecome and go? Beeps from the machines behind the counter? Cell phones? Thepaddle fan squeaking slightly as it rotates overhead? What's that squeak like?Focus on one sound and write it thoroughly.What do you smell? Probably a great many smells are comingtogether. What is the bouquet of the place? Are you smelling coffee, maybesweets, maybe something like the mop-water disinfectant that sort of lingersvery slightly beneath everything? A whiff of strong perfume or aftershavetrailing behind someone like a wake from a vessel? What are you eating and drinking? Maybe a roll and some coffee.Describe the flavors. How does each one taste separately? Consistency, texture,temperature. How do they mingle together in your mouth? What else can youdescribe about how they taste? Do the comestibles (love that word) bring upmemories, like Proust's madeleines? What are they?[could be beignets...]Does anything else you're experiencing bring up otherthoughts, memories, feelings?What are you sensing bodily? What is your chair like? Is itinteracting with your thighs and butt in a satisfactory fashion?How's your posture? How does the back of your neck feel? Hasyour jaw re-tightened? Can you sense air currents on your face? On your hands?On your legs if you're wearing shorts or a skirt? Describe the air currents.Where are they coming from, where are they going? Is your body sore or tight anywhere? Don't judge anything, just describe it. Are you wearing a watch or jewelry? A ring? Can you feel thejewelry on your skin? The weight of a necklace on your collarbones?Finally: What are you sensing beneath it all? I believe inthe sixth sense, or intuition. Is there a general mood in the place? If so,where's it coming from? Are the baristas a happy crew? Why, do you suppose, orwhy not? Is there a little corner of negativity over theresurrounding that frowning customer studying his phone? Is there somethingcreative happening over there between those three people talking excitedly? Isthere something in the spirit of the place that brings you in? Something youcan sense but not label?

{"title": "That Can be a Drag", "date": "Thursday, August 30, 2018", "text": "Zestful Blog Post #279Too many writers use too many [that]s. It’s a reflex, I think,having to do with informal speech. Using [that] can become a habit in speech,almost as a placeholder, or filler.I want you to know thatthese binoculars used to work perfectly, before you gave them to Timmy to playwith.You could cut the ‘that’ with no loss of meaning. Now there’snothing inherently wrong with the word [that]—it’s a useful word:Stop worrying aboutthat police car behind us.I don’t remember athing after that.The whispered gossip thatswept through the shire made me sick.There’s nothing even inherently wrong with extraneous thats.But they do creep into our written prose way more often than necessary,especially when used to summarize conversation or comprehension. And when you’retasked with keeping a reader’s interest, it’s a good idea to pay attention topace and economy, even on the most granular level. A few examples:He told her that heloved her.Stronger:He told her he lovedher.She knew that thereunion would be an ordeal.Stronger:She knew the reunionwould be an ordeal.[So that] can get tiring as well:Ted smoothed the clothso that it would stay flat on the table.Stronger:Ted smoothed the clothso it would stay flat on the table.While keeping an eyeout for enemy forces, the orange dinosaur rolled boulders into the tunnel sothat the treasure would be safe.Stronger:While keeping an eyeout for enemy forces, the orange dinosaur rolled boulders into the tunnel sothe treasure would be safe.You could add a bit of punctuation to change the flavor andmeaning slightly, and to be more grammatically correct:While keeping an eyeout for enemy forces, the orange dinosaur rolled boulders into the tunnel, so thetreasure would be safe.(In this case, we put a comma with a conjunction.)Getting rid of extraneous thats is easy and rewarding, onceyou know to look for them!What do you think?

{"title": "Saving it for Good", "date": "Thursday, August 16, 2018", "text": "Zestful Blog Post #277Until I was about 11 years old, money was very tight at ourhouse. When you got something new to wear, you wouldn’t dream of just puttingit on any old time; you’d ‘save it for good.’ That is, you’d reserve it to wearwhen you had to go somewhere special. If the item fell under the new school clothescategory you waited until school started, then only wore it to school, neverout to play. I believe some children still go out to play these days. I can’tremember, however, the last time I drove down some residential street and saw,for instance, two young guys playing catch in the street with a baseball andtheir mitts. Digression, sorry.The save-it-for-good habit has been hard to break. I still tendto do it even with new t-shirts, which is insane. Another digression, but I betyou can relate.Moving along. When I was in my 20’s I hung out with a bandthat played basic pop and jazz/funk at festivals and weddings here and there inthe Detroit area. We were just buddies in general, and it was fun to chill withthem on rehearsal nights. Once they let me play the tenor saxophone solo in theBilly Joel version of “Just the Way You Are” with them at some local festival. Forthat occasion, I wore a skirt and a nice top. Man, am I digressing today. But viathem I met a band promoter, a very young guy, who invited me to an after-hoursclub in Detroit for a special show. He had managed to get three record producersto agree to come see a lineup of half a dozen bands he repped. Each band wouldplay a short set. As we sat with drinks while the first band was setting up andthe producers were arriving, he explained to me his strategy: He would lead offwith the weakest group, progressing until finishing with a bang with the verybest one.[Welistened to vinyl before it was retro, didn’ we?]  “Their excitement’s just gonna keep building and buildingall night,” he told me confidently. He figured if he could sell even just thelast and best group to one of the producers, the night would be a success.Aaaaannnnd as I bet you’ve guessed, the plan backfired. By thetime the third group took their bows, all the producers had left. I will draw acurtain over the desperate measures taken by my young, inexperienced friend to tryto get the producers to stick around.And you’ve already guessed the moral of my story today forwriters: Though it’s tempting to save your best stuff for some futureunleashing, it’s far better to lead off with a bang than hope to finish withone. I’m not saying we shouldn’t carefully husband our material. But sometimessaving becomes a reflexive habit. Spend it, enjoy the rush upfront, and feelsecure that more good stuff will come!What do you think? To post, click below where it says, 'NoComments,' or '2 Comments,' or whatever.

{"title": "They Will Find You", "date": "Thursday, August 9, 2018", "text": "Zestful Blog Post #276Not long ago I was taking a walkin a nearby state park, on an overcast afternoon. The forest canopy was sothick it seemed like twilight. I heard an owl hooting and recognized it as aGreat Horned, which I’ve been fortunate to spot several times wherever I’ve lived.It occurred to me to hoot back, wondering what would happen. Turns out I have abit of a talent for owl mimicry, because the bird called again. We talked toeach other back and forth a few times, then I heard these big, soft, whooshingwingbeats coming through the trees. The owl had likely decided, “She soundssexy. I have to meet her!” Or perhaps, “I have to check out this goddaminterloper.” The forest was so thick I never did get a glimpse of the owl, who I’msure was then like, “Oh, hell, it’s just this human down there screwing withme.” But it had found me, because it had to.And this experience brought tomind a conversation I’d had many years ago at a cocktail party with a multipleaward-winning, trailblazing, fairly famous author. She had actually read someof my first work and admired it. During our talk, she mentioned that fansoccasionally would show up at her house, being drawn by the power of her writing,being moved by it, feeling compelled to meet her. (It was common knowledge whatcity and neighborhood she lived in.) I said that must be unnerving. She said itwas, because of course you never know whether the stranger is entirely stable.This was before social media and all that.I said, “Well, I hope to get asfamous as you, but I’m going to protect my privacy as best I can.”She gave me a flat look and said, “Theywill find you.”[A screwy, ghost-Kilroy, but you get the idea.]In the many years since, I haven’tbecome quite as famous as she, and no strangers have shown up at my door, butindeed they have found me. Marcia and I don’t use our street address publicly(we use a rent-a-box in a nearby UPS store), but I’ve received unexpected propositionsvia snail mail, e-mail, and social media. One of my e-mail correspondentsjokingly calls herself my “friendly stalker,” and our back-and-forths are justthat, friendly. Another correspondent was pretty frank about things, and had I notalready been attached, I might have been open to the possibility. There was aman of a mature age who, for a few years, turned up at my talks at conferences.He was shy and didn’t say much, but he did once tell me he came to all myevents. He seemed simply to be a genuine fan who wanted to learn whatever I hadto teach. Now I regret not trying to get to know him better.On a different level, there wasthe convict of some notoriety who sent me a letter via Writer’s Digestmagazine. He said they got the magazine in the prison library and he liked my articlesa lot. Furthermore, he had decided I would be the right person to collaboratewith on writing his life story. I have to say no more here except thateventually I declined. If you’re interested and we’re somewhere in person, I’lltell you more.Certainly, like many people, I’vehad unwelcome romantic attention on Facebook, but it’s easy to block that. WhenI was doing consulting work with private clients, one expressed surprise that I’dgive her my mobile phone number.And now I come to my point: Youcan’t control everything, and one must take risks here and there, or just sitin a concrete bunker all day. I mean, I’m not some big public figure, but even I’vehad unusual experiences. I do feel that rent-a-box gives Marcia and me some peace of mind.So, if you’re aimed at fame, you might consider that.

{"title": "Crowbar Beats Hammer", "date": "Thursday, August 2, 2018", "text": "Zestful Blog Post #275Not long ago I was corresponding with friend and ZestfulWriting subscriber Anne D., and the subject was current fiction. She saidsomething that really struck me: “I don’t pleasure-read to change the world; Ipleasure-read to escape it.” There are implications here. I’m fond of quoting thedistinguished author Cynthia Ozick, who, in conversation with Robert Birnbaumin 2004, said, of writing fiction: “And there is a conceptual underpinning andit’s invisible and so no one seems to know but the one who put it there. It’sgot to be invisible, because as I said a moment ago, if the concept is going tobe visible you have written an essay. You have written a tract of some kind.”We are talking about pressing ideological points in fiction.I’ve preached against this before. I emphasize there’s nothing wrong with using,or messing around with, or preferably exploring, the current cultural, religious,and political zeitgeist in one’s fiction. But if you do it with a clear agenda,“the concept is going to be visible.” And some readers will be solidly withyou, and others will be alienated. Readers prefer to come to their ownconclusions. This is a delicate and subtle subject. We agree war is hell, weagree pollution is bad, we agree incest, prejudice, and abuse are wrong. All thatis obvious. I love that Ozick used the word ‘tract’, which suggests religiousproselytizing. Many of today’s ideologues pursue their points with condemnatoryreligious fervor.Memoirists and essayists have it easy: They can and in factmust be transparent about their agendas, or nobody will know what they’retalking about. You can’t write a book that makes a case for something while beatingaround the bush.[I rummaged in the garage and cameup with a hammer and an anti-hammer.Yeah. We like a tool that pries openinstead of pounds shut.]I think what my friend Anne meant was, “I don’t want to behammered with ideology when I’m reading fiction.” Because in general, one readsfiction for pleasure, and one reads nonfiction to learn things—and possibly evento be preached to.A fiction writer can go to all those interestingsociopolitical places successfully. All you need is an open mind and heart. That way, your characters’ paths will not be predictable, to you or yourreaders. Because there’s a difference between declaring something to be wrong—orright—and exploring the nuances and contradictions of the human mind and soul.There’s usually a lot more there than an ideologue would admit. Moreover, thebest authors let their characters do the thinking.Have you ever opened a wooden packing case with a crowbar?

Regina, a routinely shamed studentin “The Cashmere Club” has a shitty life, but seizes a chance for a strange yetcomforting makeover. The manchild at the center of “West Forkton Days” teacheshimself a searing lesson about chance, love, and art.

{"title": "A Fast Hack to Shakespeare Knack", "date": "Thursday, July 19, 2018", "text": "Zestful Blog Post #273I often find myself, when talking to groups about writing, givinga particular piece of advice, and I’d like to mention it here:If you read and well digest nothing of Shakespeare but thethree main tragedies—Hamlet, King Lear, and Macbeth—you will have all youreally need of the Bard. This of course is arguable. There are Shakespeare scholarswho would consider what I just said blasphemy. Isn’t blasphemy a good old word?Aye, ’tis.[my college-days editions, withcrayoned prices…bastards always overcharged...]You can argue for Othello, Romeo and Juliet, Richard III, andthe popular comedies like A Midsummer Night’s Dream and Twelfth Night. You canargue for any of his plays; I mean, the guy was a genius with words andstories. Personally, I find his comedies to be kind of tiresome, with all themistaken identities and blind misunderstandings. They’re like lots of operas inthat way, but without the great songs.I’m talking about a hack that will educate you pretty damnwell as to what Shakespeare was all about, and that will give you a solidgrounding in what are considered by many to be his top three plays—as in mostinfluential, most popular, most highly regarded by scholars and dramatists. Somany cultural references come from those three tragedies I couldn’t even beginto do them justice. But off the top of my head:“To be or not to be…” Hamlet“Nothing will come of nothing…” Lear“Out, damned spot! out, I say.” MacbethIdeally, you’ll read and study these plays via annotatedversions, which will tell you things like what the hell a ‘chameleon’s dish’ isand what it’s supposed to mean. Right, that’s from Hamlet. Chameleons were thoughtto live on air, and thus there might be a pun on ‘heir’, involving a possibleimplication by Hamlet that he might not be entirely satisfied with the promiseof succession to the throne. But others differ. You can start to see whyShakespeare is as heavily studied and interpreted and argued over as the Talmud,which makes it an endless source of interest. You can read and reread theseplays and notice and learn new things every time. Then you can go to aShakespeare festival and have the time of your life. Apart from that personalenrichment, whenever you’re in company talking about literature and the Bardcomes up, you’ll have a good grounding and be able to contribute.Part of my admiration for Shakespeare is his economy.

{"title": "Pencil Cup Census", "date": "Thursday, July 12, 2018", "text": "Zestful Blog Post #272OK, this isn’t writing advice, but perhaps somehow this postmight help you make your writing life easier and therefore more zestful. It’sabout analogue tools. I’ve been thinking about such because I recently turnedin an article to Writer’s Digest on using old-school tools. I believe it’sgoing to run in November-December. I had a great time with it, and I’ll be sureto let you know when it’s available.Pretty much everybody has a desk cup. Whenever I visit somebody’shouse, especially another writer’s, I try to get a look at their desk cup, becauseI’m always interested in people’s tools and how they organize them. I keeprefining the contents of my own desk cup, which is fairly small. Here is thestory of my desk cup and what I keep in it.The cup itself was a gift from the Peninsula Singers, achoral group based in Port Angeles, Washington. They had special mugs handmadeas a souvenir for everyone who sang or played in a special performance of theBrahms Requiem back in 2005. Ifyou’re not familiar with the piece, it is considered one of Brahms’smasterworks. It’s his longest and biggest as well, involving full chorus andorchestra, with soloists, in seven movements. It takes about an hour or more toperform. [Boast alert!:] I played the timpani, and was gratified to see thisemail to our conductor from an audience member who appreciated fortissimo:Dated 12/15/2005  \"DearDewey, Merry Christmas!  Thank you so much for your gifts tome & the community via music.  I always enjoy the P.T. Orchestrabut this year I attended the Brahms 'Requiem'.  It was an epiphany ofrenewal of faith for me!  I was in tears (two handkerchiefs) through mostof it, but especially the 2nd movement.Please give my especial thanks tothe lady timpanist for her verve and emotion in playing.  The ff timpaniwas the renaissance of my faith.…I will say I did a good job. [Boast alert all-clear.] Sadly,the concert was not recorded, and my sole reminder is the mug. It contains allmy most-used implements, and here are photos, followed by the what-and-why.[My tiny pal Cheetoh guards everything.] And now the catalogue:-       No-brand plastic scissors with metal blades, agiveaway at a trade show when I worked for Borders. The blades have stayedsharp forever; wish I knew the manufacturer.-       Six-inch steel ruler engraved in inches andmillimeters that used to be in my dad’s tool box. This thing comes in so handy,so often, for measuring little things and sometimes scraping a label orcarefully prying something.-       Purple make-up brush, with which I dust off mycomputer and keyboard every morning. Purple was on sale. One of these alsolives in my briefcase, along with a cleaning cloth.-       Small screwdriver that can be reversed from slotto Phillips.-       Another trade-show freebie, a snap-off razor cutterfor opening packages and slashing pictures of my enemies. [Just wanted to seeif you’re paying attention.]-       Fine-point black Sharpie for addressing packagesand drawing mustaches on portraits in museums. [Ditto.]-       Two ultra-fine-point Sharpies, blue and black,for writing in shiny-coated greeting cards that reject ordinary ballpoint ink.-       Orange highlighter. I use this most often whenprepping my music for the various groups I play with. I prefer pink, because itsplits the difference between visible-enough and obtrusive. But my pink one ranout.-       Faber-Castell TK Fine Vario .7 mechanicalpencil, because my sister uses one and I like to be like her.-       Red Pilot G-2 07 pen, because sometimes you justwant the emphasis of red.-       The same pen in black, for general use.-       Pilot Hi-Tec-C Maica 0.4 in blue-black, forfiner work or just to change things up. The ink in these fine point Japanesepens lasts and lasts and lasts.-       Ivory Parker Jotter with a strangepale-green-check graphic on it. This model is one of the older ones, with ametal cap and—important for durability—metal ring around the tip. I’vecustomized this with a broad-point blue refill by Monteverde. Lovely to writewith.-       Soft-graphite wood-cased pencil such as theBlackwing original or the Faber-Castell 4B. Often it’s a Blackwing 602, whichis the hardest Blackwing, but still on the soft side.-       Fountain pens stay on standby in a drawer; Idon’t like to store them vertically in a cup.You’ll notice there are no multiples of anything. When youhave like six pencil stubs, plus four cheap gimme pens from wherever, theycrowd up the cup and stuff gets jammed. So, my point today is, you can saveyourself a bunch of scrambling around if you just keep a few little thingshandy, buffered by a bit of empty space.What indispensables are found in your desk cup?

Thatpassage resonates, because self-criticism dwells within all of us. But if you giveyourself permission to produce crummy stuff, you will have the chance toimprove. You may or may not improve, but you’ll have the chance.But that’s just theory, right? The doubts and negativitythat spew from the little bitch or bastard on your shoulder as you write—or sitthere staring at your notebook or blank screen—are real. Yes! Those ugly, hissedwords: Who the hell do you think you are?You suck. You can’t. You’ll never amount to anything as a writer because notonly do you suck, your work sucks, and there’s so little of it! And everybodyknows it. Anybody who says they find value in your work is just being phonywith you because they feel sorry for you. What a crummy loser! Honestly. Hey,here’s an idea: Don’t you wanna check how many likes you got on your last poston whatever the hell social media? Right now? Hey, why don’t you just quitwriting for now and go buy a tub of that gourmet ice cream? You’ll only eat alittle bit of it. You’ll save the rest for tomorrow.Right.I mean, did you laugh? Because it’s so ridiculous when you seeit all laid out.Here’s the thing: You can never shut up the bitch or bastardon your shoulder by force. In fact, they love it when you try to force them toshut up. It just gives them more dramatic attention, more strength. So, what doyou do? Welcome them. Listen coldly, then go, “Thanks for the shit, pal. I’lllisten to you again soon, but now I’m getting back to work. Chillax until wemeet again.”[When I tried to look at herobjectively, in order to draw what she really looks like,she disappeared.

You didn’t get as much done as you wanted. Sowhat? Neither did I. All that matters is that you do it.

{"title": "You Burn What You Got", "date": "Thursday, June 21, 2018", "text": "Zestful Blog Post #269I picked up a copy of National Geographic magazine a coupleof months ago, interested in the cover story on Pablo Picasso. A curator of hiswork was quoted as saying that Picasso’s greatest talent was “assemblage”—or synthesizing,if you like. From the article: “to sift through layered memories—a conversationwith a poet, the haunting expressions in an El Greco painting, the medley ofsensations from Malaga, a pot of paint in his studio.”The curator mentioned the French expression, faire feu detout bois: to make fire of all wood. In rural Washington state, where Marciaand I lived for seven years, most people heated primarily with wood harvestedfrom their own property. I once commented to a neighbor that I wished we hadmore madrone on our property, because it was so dense and burned so well. He shruggedand said, “You burn what you got.”I guess that’s just another way to say, quit wishing thingswere different and use the brains you have to make the most of the materials athand.  [OK, not a Picasso, not a Van Gogh, but the best I could doduring an “I can paint!” phase…]Like a homesteader, Picasso sure did make the most of whathe had.

{"title": "Off Topic", "date": "Thursday, June 14, 2018", "text": "Zestful Blog Post #268It’s rare for me to stray off the topics of writing and the writer’s life, but today I kind of have to. If you read no further than the period at the end of this sentence, I just want to say you never know how profoundly your friendship might affect someone.Folks have been talking a lot about the recent celebrity suicides, and therefore suicide in general. I was taken aback to read a social media post by an old friend who mentioned my name among a few others as friends who helped her, during some very dark times, stay away from the brink. I’d known she was struggling on and off, and just tried to be a good friend. But I hadn’t known how much my simple friendship meant to her.What’s a good friend? Just someone, it seems, who gets in touch and wants to do stuff together. Someone who listens. Someone who can laugh. That seems to be it.Sometimes, though, that’s not enough, and it’s not your fault. So far in my life I’ve had one friend who committed suicide; no one knew how bad things were for her until it was too late. The worst social gathering I ever attended was her funeral, where all the wonderful hundreds of people who loved her were there. Beautiful day. Everybody was there except her. She was still lying on a slab in the morgue with a purple face and a groove around her neck from the rope. The family was too shattered to decide what to do with her just yet.I read another social media post where someone pointed out that when an airplane decompresses, they tell you to put on your oxygen mask before helping others. So yeah. Check on yourself. How are you doing? Breathe normally.It’s one thing to be there if a friend reaches out when they’re staring into the abyss. Naturally, you go. You do everything you can. But somehow, I guess it’s important to listen to your gut too. Even if things don’t seem that bad, your friend needs you to suggest grabbing a cup of coffee. Or get out for a walk. Just a little something.You might never know.What do you think of all this? To post, click below where it says, 'No Comments,' or '2 Comments,' or whatever.

{"title": "Everybody Skips the Begats", "date": "Thursday, June 7, 2018", "text": "Zestful Blog Post #267When I was about 12 years old, I got into a phase of wantingto explore religion. I decided a good first step would be to read the Biblefrom beginning to end, because it seemed that’s the way you’re supposed to reada book. Front to back. Being an experienced consumer of novels by then, I knewthat skipping ahead was a sign of weak will.Moreover, it seemed people knew the Bible stories, but nobodyever sat down and read the whole thing straight through. Nobody I knew, anyway.My family had a so-called Catholic Bible, or the Douay version, which I somehowunderstood to be ‘not the real thing.’I reasoned that checking a Protestant-issue Bible out of thelibrary would be counterproductive, because the library only granted tworenewals, and I figured that such a long book with such thin pages and such small print would take me half the summer to get through. So, with someallowance money, I bought my very own pocket-sized King James version, openedit up, and started reading. As I went, I underlined passages that seemedespecially relevant with a blue ballpoint pen.As you may know, Genesis starts off with the creation story,which is halfway decent reading. But as soon as Cain slays Abel and getsbanished, we learn about Cain’s wife and kids, which, who cares? This comesaround the end of Chapter 4, and the chapters are pretty short in through here.We learn about Cain’s kids, and their kids, and more generations of kids. To beaccurate, though, we don’t learn aboutthem, we just learn they got born and named.But don't even talk to me about Chapter 5.[Other people's family trees are so boring. Photo by ES] Here’s where thebegats really come thick and fast. And you’re like, why? I’m never going to rememberthese people, I’m probably never going to see them again, and yet I have toread that they existed. The narrative picks back up again in the next chapter, featuringNoah and all his cubits, then things get sloggy again. You realize, oh, hell,Noah’s got to re-populate the planet! I am in for so many more begats.I put the book down for a few weeks and returned to NancyDrew. When I picked it up again I stuck with it fairly well, but stalled out oncemore in Numbers. Yet more begats. When I got to college and took a course inthe Bible as literature, I understood things a lot better. And when I asked theprofessor why he didn’t make us read the begats, he just shrugged and said, “Everybodyskips the begats.”So we see time-honored lessons for authors:·      Get right going with some action on page one.·      If you front-load your story with characters,you’ll risk losing your reader.·      Give every character a purpose, for God’s sake.·      Be nice to your brother and animals.What do you think?

{"title": "Magic Cure for Blurb Paralysis", "date": "Thursday, May 31, 2018", "text": "Zestful Blog Post #266I predict that someday soon we will be able to load themaster file of our novel into a program, and the artificial intelligencetherein will fashion and spit out a compelling back-cover blurb in .4 seconds,as well as a coupon for half off that rib roast you were looking at in thegrocery store the other day. And I’m sure that six months after that, AI bots willwrite all of our novels for us, collect our royalties, and spend the money onthemselves. Until then, we wrestle with all of this. (Zestful friend B,it’s been a long time since you made this request, but I didn’t forget it.)Using my own ALI (admittedly limited intelligence), I spent sometime analyzing back-cover blurbs for a bunch of bestselling novels, and havecome up with three foolproof formulae, which you may use at will.Mystery/thriller:[Name of protagonist] is [doing something normal] when[extraordinary thing happens]. Now, [specific danger lies ahead] unless he getsinvolved in solving truth behind extraordinary thing. Meanwhile, an old[friend / associate / romantic connection] shows up, with [an entirelydifferent problem / an unexpected gift / an astonishing proposal]. [Protagonist]is reluctant to get involved, but because of [a debt owed / a guilty conscience/ an old grudge / a dying request], he can’t say no. His quest takes him from [dangerouslocation] to [dangerous situation]. As the tension ratchets higher, the two [seeminglyseparate plot strands] converge. Along the way, [protagonist] learns [a lifetruth, like things are more complicated than they seem] as well as the factthat [morals can be ambiguous / he never really knew what loyalty was beforenow / a person we love the most can be toxic].[Spend less time on troublesome crap so youcan get out and play once in a while. Photo by ES]Cozy suspense:Everything’s going great in [name of happy place]! Everyonewe meet [the three or four main people and how they’re related] think they’ve gotlife figured out, as they go about their business of [running a resort /managing a farm / being the city council]. Until, that is, [a messenger arriveswith a disturbing piece of news / a family secret springs out of hiding / someonedies under strange circumstances] and everything is turned upside-down. It’s upto [name of main character or pair of main characters] to dig into [the past /a scary neighboring ranch / the deepest computer databases of some governmentagency] to find the truth. Along the way, they discover [ancillary weird stuff],and they come face-to-face with their own [demons / prejudices / comforting yetcreepy family myths]. Shocking revelation follows shocking revelation as theygrapple with [their own thirst for revenge / the fact that things aren’t whatthey seem / the knowledge that love can be toxic] —and begin the healingprocess.Romance:[Name of protagonist] is having a bad day. Everything’swrong, from [crappy thing] to [disappointing event]. Now, to make mattersworse, here comes [name of antagonist], who is the [new hire / lead detectiveon the case / biology class lab partner] and with whom she must cooperate or[some consequence will happen, like get a bad performance review / blow thecase / get a bad grade]. [Protagonist] and [antagonist] are at each other’sthroats day and night. Until, that is, [event happens, like a shared crisis / anew enemy appears against whom they can unite / one of them gets in a diresituation that can only be solved by the other]. Suddenly their petty grudgesdon’t seem so important anymore. Love molecules fly, and as the two discover truepassion, [another serious event occurs]. Can they continue to build their loveand trust even in the face of [dire happenings which require one to betray theother]?The magic here simply is that you can easily analyze andappropriate for yourself what, in many cases, was put together by people whoare specialists in blurb-writing, such as the editing staff at majorpublishers.What do you think?

{"title": "Escape from Synopsis Hell", "date": "Thursday, May 24, 2018", "text": "Zestful Blog Post #265Recently an aspiring novelist asked me for help in writing hersynopsis. Then another one did, and I figure it’s time to say a few more thingsabout doing synopses, beyond last year's Zestful Blog Post #206, \"Magic Cure for Synopsis Paralysis.\" The Web abounds with good advice on how to write a synopsis for yourbook project, and you can google around. Here is my minimum advice for maximumsuccess.A synopsis is a short document that tells what happens inyour book. Agents and editors want them so they have to do less work, likereading your manuscript. The format they expect is thirdperson, present tense, so do that, no matter what you’ve used in your story. Theyalso expect that when they see a character’s name for the first time, it willbe in all caps and/or bold. That’s it. Don’t add pictures or curlicues.Relax and decide you’re gonna have fun doing this, goddammit.Even though writing a synopsis feels like a matter of life and death, getting tensejust becomes its own problem.Forge your material with an iron will and a light heart. Photo by ES Here we go.Accept the fact that there’s no such thing as a perfectsynopsis. Just as you need to dump perfectionism while writing, you need todump it here too. You might need to write a long synopsis (thousands of words)and a short one (hundreds), because agents and editors ask for different things.Start with the long one. Then just cut it down to make the short one. We’lltalk about back-cover blurbs some other time.In your rough-out session, flip through the manuscript and writedown the heart-clutching moments. You’ve just created your synopsis framework. In \"Magic Cure,\" I advise talking it into a recording device instead of writing it. This works for some writers but not others, so you can do it whatever way suits you.Flesh things out by writing how each heart-clutching momentis connected to the next. If you get stuck, just tell what happens next as simplyas you can.Prompt yourself with these two questions: What does yourmain character lose (or expend) during the story? What does he win (or gain) atthe end? Because that’s basically your plot. Keep that character’s wins andlosses in front of your reader.Give yourself a short amount of time to do this. You can andwill dick around with this forever, unless you decide something like, “I’ll getit roughed out between 2 and 3 this afternoon, and come what may, I’ll get itfinished before meeting Joe and Rose Ellen for cocktails on Saturday.”Break up your time on it. This might sound counter to what Ijust said, because won’t more work sessions add up to more time? Not necessarily.If you try to get the thing done in one long session, you’ll glaze over andstop being able to tell what sounds/reads good. But if you let it sit overnightand come back to it, maybe even three or four times, you’ll keep bringing afresh perspective to it, and you’ll save time in the end. Spend no more than anhour at a stretch on it.Cut anything that doesn’t sound peppy.Declare victory and move on.Before asking for comments, I want to congratulate my friendAlison Solomon on her new book:Now, what do you think?

{"title": "Surely We Jest", "date": "Thursday, May 17, 2018", "text": "Zestful Blog Post #264In the July/August 2018 issue of Writer’s Digest magazine wefind a feature by yours truly on writing comic characters. I focused on classictypes of funny characters, looking at how master writers handled them, and howwe can do it too. There are other great articles about writing humor, including an interview with one of my fave authors, cover boy George Saunders.Here’s the intro and first section of my article, \"Funny People\":[Magazine excerpt begins]It was 1975, and I was a nervous freshman unpacking mySamsonites in my university dorm room when a strong voice behind me said, “Hey.”Standing in the open doorway was the darkly beautiful girl who was alreadyestablishing herself as the floor’s alpha. She looked at me with a sternexpression and demanded, “Are you hip?”Unsure what the hell she meant, I thought a moment, then responded,“I wouldn’t think that’s for me to say.”She looked stunned, then burst into uproarious laughter.“Oh! You are a character!” she cried. “That was deadpan! You will be my jester!”I hadn’t meant my answer to be funny, but it must have triggered some humorreceptor in her brain. I have a feeling she’d been interviewing other girls, whoprobably sought her approval by asserting that they were, yes, sure, hip. So myanswer probably contrasted with theirs, and that’s what seemed funny. Thisyoung creature was trying to build a story for herself, in which she was thehead of a sort of aristocratic court, right there in the midst of everybody’stextbooks and popcorn poppers and Cosmoissues.The court situation didn’t exactly work out (for one thing, noone was into being a lady-in-waiting), but this incident got me thinking forthe first time about the power of a type.I had long ago learned that being funny can be an asset. Side note: ‘Deadpan’is a combination word, made up of ‘pan,’ slang for face, and ‘dead,’ meaningexpressionless.Not all authors employ humor; bookstore shelves real anddigital are populated with fiction that takes itself deeply seriously. But manyauthors use humor to brighten their stories, give their readers an emotionalescape valve, and add a layer of fun. Comedy can fit into suspense, romance, literary,fantasy, horror, you name it. Why? Because it’s like real life. We’ve allexperienced countless humorous moments, even amidst sadness—like the one time Iattended a burial where the backhoe fell into the grave.If you’re considering using humor in your story, play, ornovel, I’ll bet it’s because you have a keen sense of wit yourself: You canlaugh at the absurdities of life, and you enjoy the humor in the stories youread and ingest via other media. It’s as simple as that.There are lots of ways to write funny moments. You can putwisecracks into the mouth of your detective or write action sequences where alittle kid puts a peanut on the train tracks and changes the course of history.But long-haul comedy—that is, comedy that can develop and sustain a story—startswith characters. The comic characteris unique in that he or she can be counted on to deliver humor and truthtogether.Just as comedy itself tends to fall into types—slapstick,dark humor, farce, satire, irony, and so on—so too do comic characters. Typesare a handy way to understand comedic characters—and to consciously create them.I’m not talking about stereotypes,which most readers recognize as clichéd, unimaginative, or even offensive. Thetypes discussed here are classics. They’re successful because they allow flexibilityin a story, and because readers and writers alike recognize them as old friends.Now let’s break down some of these entertaining breeds andsee how to use them.The JesterIt was no coincidence that my dorm-mate dubbed me jester, asit’s arguably the earliest form of the comic character.In medieval and renaissance times, royal courts employedentertainers to tell jokes, sing, and dance. We have history that some of thesejesters also became confidants of—and advisors to—the monarch, finding a way tospeak truth to power under the safety shield of jest. “My lord, the one youbanish will gain cunning in the punishment! Haha, just kidding!” And the kingmay reject that warning, or not.Shakespeare made liberal use of jesters, also known asfools, in his plays both comic and tragic. Puck, in A Midsummer Night’s Dream, sprinkles his love potion on the wrong handsomesleeping dude, thus pivoting the plot in a way both humorous and disastrous. Audienceslove the “Uh-oh” moment! The Fool in KingLear explains things with biting, rueful wit and provides a voice of reasonfrom which Lear can still learn, even though he’s made a mess of things.Randle P. McMurphy in Ken Kesey’s One Flew Over the Cuckoo’s Nest is a more modern jester. He swaggersinto the asylum and flings around his brand of street-criminal wit and wisdom—effectingchange, comedy, and tragedy all in one story.How to do it:·      Give your jester a low place in the socioeconomicpecking order. This sets the character apart, for when he subtly speaks truth,your audience will be surprised—and a little apprehensive. If your jesterdoesn’t have much in terms of status or resources, he doesn’t have much to lose.That’s an opportunity right there.·      Make your jester a character of some complexity.Plain silliness falls flat here. Feigned ignorance, however, can work, as whena jester pretends not to understand something while making a sly point. Whetheryou show much of it or not, your jester does have an inner life.

{"title": "For the Sake of It", "date": "Thursday, May 10, 2018", "text": "Zestful Blog Post #263The other day as I was taking a walk down the nearby parkway,a runner came along from the opposite direction. Each of us politely bent ourpaths to give the other extra room. I noted he was young and solidly built; notfat, but not in possession of the typical whip-thin runner’s body. I was struckby his expression, his general vibe, which I can best describe as calmly committed.I got the impression he was neither joyful nor anxious. His pace was fasterthan a jog, but not a lot. He seemed in a comfort zone, cardio-wise; he wasrunning easily and showed no tension on his face or in his gait. It would seem goingon this run was part of his workout schedule and this is what he was doing. Perhapsthe running was to provide conditioning for a different sport, in which casethe run could be considered a means to an end, or perhaps he simply very muchliked to run. But whatever the case, it felt to me as if he was running for therunning itself.[Roam the Parkway and sometimes you get a rainbow. Photo by ES] The thing I’m trying to grasp or convey is he seemed not toexpect or want anything. He didn’t seem to want to be doing anything butexactly what he was doing, and he didn’t seem to be awaiting—or craving—any particularresult. He didn’t seem the slightest bit self-conscious. I guess this guystruck me because I see so many people out getting their exercise with the vibeof “I can’t wait for this to be over,” or “I hope you’re noticing how good I lookin my shorts and abs, cuz I work hard to be fit and I’m pretty damn proud ofit.” I sometimes find myself being impatient in the pool, counting my laps and wishingfor my workout to be over. I have to keep catching myself and re-focusing myattention on what matters: the feel of the water, the feel of my body slipping throughit, the inner attentiveness to this moment as a moment unto itself rather thana means to an end. Paradoxically, this allows me to make minute calculations asto how I might be more efficient in the water.There is, of course, a lesson in here for writers. In orderto get the best possible fulfillment out of our path, we should not want andexpect, but simply be and do. This is the Zen way, I guess; Zen in motion.Here’s another situation I’ve given a lot of thought to,which is the question of what is worthwhile? (This next part has a church init, but religion is not the point.) On holidays and special Sundays, I play thetimpani in a big church in a retirement community in Florida; the church iswell supported, and they put together musical ensembles for these special daysand pay us well. I love the music director and I love playing the timps, so thisis good. But I don’t do religion much, personally, and all of us musicians muststay put through three services, which of course means listening to threedeliveries of the pastor’s sermon. Because we’re seated up front we cannot get outour phones and watch cat videos or argue politics on Facebook or reread AgathaChristie.Which gives us a choice: either be bored shitless or find something meaningfulto focus on. It’s not easy. Sometimes the pastor’s sermons are corny to me. Someof the congregation have dull faces. Lots of the congregation wear outfits I findincredibly tacky. But they feel good in them. They come to church, they listen,they pray, they sing. I listen too, because I might learn something unexpected,because the pastor in fact sometimes says brilliant things. I might make eyecontact with a congregant and learn something there, something very subtle,perhaps. The pastor is sincere, and, like my running guy, does this thing overand over, week in and week out, for the sake of doing it, for the sake ofserving his God and his congregation. All of us, even the preacher, might getbored sometimes, but everybody’s there, exposing themselves to spiritualopportunity. When it comes time to play the drums, I give it everything I’vegot, because otherwise why bother? Sometimes people come up to us and tell usthey enjoyed our playing. We made a little difference for somebody that day. There’sno point wishing we were touring the world with some marquee orchestra, playingconcerts on the banks of the Rhine or the Thames or Sydney Harbor. We are wherewe are.If I were to nutshell this whole thing, my message for us aswriters would be: Don’t waste time wishing we were sitting in a café inGreenwich Village or Paris, having intellectual conversations, after which wereturn to our fascinating work as high-minded writers. Let us be, really be,where we are. Let’s not skim over hours, days, years just because much of theshit we have to do isn’t giving us something we want. Because it isn’t ideal.I’m not saying don’t strive. Yes, strive! Strive like hell.But what we have now is as ideal as anything. It’s as ideal as we make it. Worthwhile,all of it, if we want it to be. Write for the sake of writing. Live for thesake of living. Give it everything you’ve got. Let’s be together.What do you think of this metaphysical stuff?

{"title": "Powers of Three", "date": "Thursday, May 3, 2018", "text": "Zestful Blog Post #262The other day I spent some time with an old (91) but still sharp,friend. The subject of television programs came up, and we compared notes on famousshows we liked. She liked Downton Abbey, Mad Men, and a few other series withan ensemble cast of main characters and a multitude of minor characters. “Andyou know,” she said, leaning forward on her cane, “I notice that all theseshows have three plot lines going inevery episode!”Now that’s a trenchant observation.Any writer can make something of that. Simple. Threeplotlines, with characters weaving in and out? Yeah! But how do we handle andplan? Here’s an easy way: Pick a focal, or center, point first. Then everythingflows from there.In Downton Abbey, for instance, it was the estate itself.They didn’t call the show “The Granthams,” which was the family’s name; theycalled it by the focal point, the place where everybody comes and goes, wherecharacters have roots and history and where new stuff still happens all thetime. Off the top of my head, I’m thinking of Lord Grantham’s faultyinvestments, Lady Mary’s unfortunate tryst with the handsome European minister,the housekeeper O’Brien’s nasty, relentless scheming.Sometimes a show’s focal point is one main character, likeSeinfeld or I Love Lucy. The action follows that character’s trials andtribulations, and the other characters’ stories interweave with that character.Take a look at classic plays, and you’ll see the same three-plotdynamic. Looking at Tennessee Williams’s Caton a Hot Tin Roof, we see a very neat three-plot system:Brick and his self-destruction (with wife Maggie at the side);Big Daddy’s dreams (with wife Big Mama supporting);Brother/son Gooper and his expectations (with wife Maesupporting).Three guys, three wives, three lives. And such thunderous,satisfying drama!And the novel form (you knew I’d get to it) is perfect for thethree-strand plot. Lots and lots of novels feature three or more plot strands,also known as the main plot and subplots. For writers who find the commonlyrecommended three-act structureconfounding or too limiting, thinking about a three-strand plot this way can be a terrific portal to excellence.Of course, all three plots must intersect. Let’s look at awell-known novel such as To Kill aMockingbird. There’s the plot strand of the children’s lives as they playand grow, the plot strand of the Tom Robinson case, and there’s the plot strandof Boo Radley. Bam, done. Beautiful. Reread the book from the perspective ofthree plots, and you’ll learn a ton. Which of those strands would you considerthe main plot? Is there a main plot?What if you’re telling a story from a single viewpoint, suchas in a first-person situation, or third-person limited? Well, in my LillianByrd books, which are narrated by the main character, there’s always a crimeLillian is trying to solve, and there’s always a love interest—Lillian meetssomeone; will this work out or not?—and there’s pretty much always somethinggoing on with another significant character and their struggles in the world.Lillian is the focal point, and three or more plotlines swirl around her.Now that you’re more conscious of it, you can bringthree-strand awareness to the stories you consume via books or video, andyou’re going to be able to see it, and you’re going to keep on observing,analyzing, learning. The next step is to execute a three-strand plot foryourself, and discover the joys it has in store for you. Keep it simple!What do you think?

{"title": "A Deeper Shade of Flavor", "date": "Thursday, April 26, 2018", "text": "Zestful Blog Post #261I love learning something more profoundly than Ioriginally learned it. A reader helped me recently, and I want to share thelearning with you.Ifyou keep track of Writer’s Digest magazine, you noticed a piece on dialogue byme in the May-June 2018 edition. It’s actually an excerpt from You’ve Got a Book in You, where I discusshow to sharpen your dialogue skills by tuning in to the natural speech around us.I mention reading plays, and included this little story:[excerptbegins] Not long ago when I read a play by the extremely talentedMartin McDonagh, The Beauty Queen ofLeenane, I kept noticing the word soat the end of characters’ lines, and I was like, I guess that’s an Irish-ism.And it sort of is, but sometime later I heard myself say so at the end of sentences sometimes, like, “I already ate, so.”Which is a trailing off with a precise meaning: “So I won’t go along to lunchwith you guys.”I heard myself say that and a bell rang in my head, and Iremembered those plays where sentences ended in so, and I realized, “I dothat, it’s a modernism, it isn’ttotally just an Irish-ism.” And I understood another little thing aboutrealistic dialogue there. [excerptends]Andthen I got this email from a writer and reader in a far-off land!:[emailbegins] Myname is Bronwen, I’m a Toronto-based writer. I read your article on dialogue inthis month’s Writer’s Digest and really enjoyed it.I’mwriting to you with a little tidbit which you may or may not find interesting.I grew up in Ireland but moved away, first to the UK and then Canada, about 12years ago and as a writer and word nerd have often thought about how the Irishspeak English, including the use of the word “so”.Irishpeople don’t use it at the end of a sentence as an American / Canadian might,letting the sentence trail off (as in, “I already ate, so... [I won’t join youfor dinner]”) but rather as another way of saying “in that case”. For example:“We’re going to be late if we walk.”“Let’sget the bus so.”“We should eat that chicken tonight.”“I’lltake it out of the freezer so.”Anyway,I just thought I would share -- you seem like a fellow word nerd who would findsuch an idiomatic way of speaking interesting.[emailends] [Bronwen, thank you for giving me permission to share that!] AndI went back and looked through that play to try to prove it, and Bronwen isright! Here are a few lines:[excerptfrom The Beauty Queen of Leenane begins]Maureen:You don’t give it a good enough stir is what you don’t do.Mag:I gave it a good enough stir and there was still lumps.Maureen:You probably pour the water in too fast so. What it says on the box, you’resupposed to ease it in. [excerpt ends] [Photo of the book cover by ES. Original photo by Amelia Stein.The actress is Anna Manahan as Mag. I wouldn't want to cross her, either.] If you replace Maureen’s “so” with “in that case”you have the exact meaning Bronwen was talking about. I hadn’t understood itfully before.And there, ya see? This is why it’s so great toconnect with writers and readers all over the place, who take languageseriously and continually strive to grasp and master it! Happy times. Wordnerds, unite! Talk to me about this stuff.Before signing off, here are a couple more itemsfrom friends:Rick Bettencourt’s latest novel:And: Here is information, forwarded by novelist Cheryl Head, about a new GCLS Bridge Builder scholarship for women of color.What do you think?

{"title": "Awards Night Survival Guide", "date": "Thursday, April 19, 2018", "text": "Zestful Blog Post #260OK, so I promised to follow up on Zestful blog post #255, “AwardsVersus Happiness.” Marcia and I went to Tallahassee last Thur-Sat to attend theFlorida Book Awards dinner and participate in other very nice events: amorning-after breakfast at the Midtown Reader and a panel talk and signing atWord of South, an annual music/books festival at the pretty fabulous CascadesPark.My most burning question before the awards dinner was whetherwe would just be handed our medals, or whether the bling would be givenOlympics-style. Thankfully, we got handed a little box with our medal in italong with our name tags and drink tickets at check-in. No stress.   [Formy standalone novel, Crimes in a Second Language. Sorry if you saw this already on FB.]  I was glad we went; it seems the awards are a bigger dealthan I thought, and the evening was swankier than I expected. Lots of verysmart and accomplished people in the room, all interested in, and many devotedto, quality writing, research, and expression. And given that Florida StateUniversity is in charge, meaning actual paid staff handle things, you couldcount on things going smoothly, and somebody there to fix problems right away.Nothing against events run exclusively by volunteers. God bless them. I havevolunteered at events. But you know what I mean.OK, based on having attended many awards dinners, and received prizes at a few, here’s my survival guide. Do these things and you are 75 percent less likely to lie awake later, silently insulting yourself:·      Arrive sober. If you’re a social drinker,consume one drink immediately, which will loosen you up during mix and mingle.Then nurse the next one for the rest of the evening, so you don’t look like alush. Everybody at your table counts everybody’s drinks.·      For non-drinkers, you have far less to worryabout. You probably don’t know this, but you are envied by social drinkers inthese situations. For instance, if a drinker says something they later thinksounded stupid, they’re like, “Oh, hell, I shouldn’t have had that wine.” Butin their heart of hearts they know it was just them. Non-drinkers don’t have todo any mental/emotional gymnastics.·      Realize that everybody is a little or a lotnervous. If you act cool, that helps others relax and makes you look good. Act cool by being friendly. My openingline was, “Hi. Who are you and what did you win?” which always drew a gratefulsmile and started a convo. Nobody expects you to know who everybody is and whatthey did. Another good one is, “Hi. What’s your role here tonight?” Or, “Whatare you up for?”·      Try to be attentive to your spouse/partner,introduce them around, and mention their accomplishments at dinner. Often thespouses have the most interesting stories!·      Write out your remarks in advance. I considerthis a no-brainer, but have witnessed unprepared speakers get flustered. Andyou’re there because of your work, so make your comments mostly about that,rather than yourself. (FWIW, my remarks for FBA are reproduced below.)·      Tell your table-mates they did a good job whenthe come back from the dais. Everybody appreciates this.·      If it’s the kind of uncivilized event where youdon’t know who won what until it’s announced, steel yourself for disappointment.I hate events like this. Needless to say, if you lose, try to congratulate thewinners. The key is to remember this too shall pass; there’s always next time.If you won this time, you might lose next time, and the other way around.·      Thank everybody as the evening unfolds, and don’tforget the wait staff. Put a buck or two into the bartender’s cup.·      These days everybody’s pretty cool with postingselfies, etc. on social media during events. So post away, but avoid lookinglike a twelve-year-old by fiddling on your phone only a little bit.·      Be neither the first nor the last to leave.·      Send follow-up emails of thanks to theorganizers, etc. Handwritten notes are great too!Special shout-outs to:Jenni McKnight and Chase Miller, Florida State UniversityWayne and Shirley Wiegand and the Abitz familyKaitlin Silcox, Museum of Florida HistorySally Bradshaw and her staff and bookstore, the MidtownReaderMark Mustian, Word of SouthLaura Lee Smith, gold medalist and co-panelist par excellenceFor the heck of it, here’s what I said when called up to thedais that evening:[Remarks for winningFBA silver medal, Tallahassee, April 12, 2018It’s great to be in the winner’s circle, with so manytalented authors. Thank you to the Florida Book Awards and all the organizers,Florida State University, and all the affiliates.Thank you to the judges in my category—Chris, Jennifer,Dianna. Having been a judge for literary contests, I know it’s a difficulttask, and largely a thankless one.Moreover, I’m extremely gratified that the judges took CRIMESIN A SECOND LANGUAGE seriously: a book I released under my own imprint, SprucePark Press. I have been published by a Big Five house, Macmillan, and bysmaller publishers. But there have been massive changes in how books come tomarket, and I appreciate this organization’s recognition of that.CRIMES IN A SECOND LANGUAGE is a standalone novel, apartfrom my two series. It was prompted by a true situation. By the way, it is nota book about Florida. It’s set in Los Angeles. I wanted to bring in the flavorof all that Hollywood hustle, and because I’ve spent a lot of time in LosAngeles with family, and with friends in show business. My uncle and aunt livednear LA, and they were retired, and they employed a young housecleaner who hadbeen recommended to them by a neighbor. The cleaner, Maria, was from Mexico,and she didn’t speak English. And my aunt and uncle didn’t speak Spanish, andso every time Aunt Tracy needed to tell Maria something in particular, she hadto go get the neighbor who spoke Spanish.One day Aunt Tracy, who had been a kindergarten teacher,asked Maria if she’d like to learn English. Si!So Maria started coming one day a week to clean, and another day to learn. Assoon as Aunt Tracy started teaching her English, she discovered that not onlydid Maria not know English, she knew very little about anything else, becauseshe had only gone to school in Mexico through the fifth grade. So then AuntTracy started teaching regular school to Maria. Elementary subjects. Because ofthis bonding over learning, those two women became lifelong friends.HOWEVER. This teaching and learning did not sit at all wellwith Maria’s husband, Jose. He barely spoke English, and he didn’t want Mariato get ahead of him. Aunt Tracy offered to teach him too, but he said no. Andhe tried to get Maria to stop learning.And when I heard about this, and I met Maria, I startedthinking, well, what if there was a more nefarious reason that Jose didn’t wanthis wife getting more educated? What if he was up to something seriouslycriminal, yes, and what if Maria knowing how to read and write English could bedangerous for him? And that set me onto a plot where (spoiler!) the Josecharacter is much more sophisticated and educated than he let on. I brought inHollywood in the form of a film-producer neighbor, and an aspiring author whowrites technical manuals about machines that make airplane parts, and Iintroduced themes of corporate sabotage, money, greed, idealism, and truefriendship. Another spoiler: the two women in the story become lifelongfriends.And I had a lot of fun with it. Oh, and one last thank-you,to my supportive and wonderful wife Marcia.Thank you very much.]Do you have an awards-dinner anecdote to share? Was thispost interesting/potentially helpful?

{"title": "The Power of Thank You", "date": "Wednesday, April 11, 2018", "text": "Zestful Blog Post #259Last week I got an email from a high school student in LosAngeles who asked if I would serve as his writing mentor for his senior essayproject. As you might guess, I get asked to help writers a lot, from youngpeople to elderscribes (yeah, I just made that word up!), and I have to say noto almost everybody. Because I hate saying no, I sometimes try to give theperson a bit of help anyway. In this case, I did a little research and came upwith two suggestions for the young man: a possible local mentor, and an articleI found that I thought might be helpful to his project.It’s funny, but when the student wrote back saying thankyou, and that he understood, I felt this surge of warmth toward him. Many times,I don’t get a thank-you, and I predicted this young stranger would not bother.But I was happily wrong. I’ve given back-cover or inside-pages book blurbs toauthors who never said thanks. Isn’t that amazing? It takes time to do those things. (When they ask the nexttime, guess what I’m gonna say?) One does not help people solely to be thanked,but it certainly does your heart good when it happens, and you remember it. I’llalways have warm feelings toward certain people I’ve helped who’ve gone out oftheir way to say thank you, or even send a little gift. (I have my eye on a2018 Corvette, blue, hardtop, in case you’d really like to get on my good side.Seriously. Awesome car.)[I kind of think this is a picture of gratitude. It's a prayer rug from the 19th century. Image courtesy of the Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York.]The times I’ve neglected to say thank you (and realized it) still bother me,even though they were when I was young and didn’t really know better. Not longago I thanked a newsletter editor for highlighting one of my books, and shewrote back thanking me for the thank-you, saying it was “rare to get a thank-youfrom an author.”So I guess my humble bit of professional wisdom today is: Athank-you is not only polite, but it actually goes some distance in networkingand plain old building of human capital. So, you know, win-win. Such a simplebut powerful thing!

If you’re thinking it must be the samewith triceps and quadriceps, you would be right.[A Case knife with clip and pen blades. Photo by ES.]In olden times when writers used quill pens, they fashionedthe points with a small knife blade, maybe an inch or so long. This blade wasusually fixed in a handle and was part of most deskscapes. It was a penknife: aknife used to make pens. Sometimes penknives were made as tiny folding knives,often seen at the end of pocket-watch chains. A jackknife is a knife with afolding blade, also known as a pocketknife. Some jackknives feature a smallblade, called by knifemakers a pen blade, along with a larger blade.Yet many writers are now calling any folding knife apenknife.

{"title": "When False is Sort of True", "date": "Thursday, March 29, 2018", "text": "Zestful Blog Post #257I’ve always had a morbid curiosity about unusual crimes,from the JFK assassination to the Manson murders to the two Teds (Bundy and Kaczynski)to OJ, on and on. This fits into my obsession with “Why do people do what theydo?” Which fits into my obsession with writing with as much truth and authenticityas possible. One crime that’s gotten revived lately is the Tonya Harding –Nancy Kerrigan affair from 1994, due to the award-winning biopic “I, Tonya.”The picture came out last fall, in time to be discussed in the run-up to thisyear’s winter Olympics. Having been fascinated by the crime as it unfolded inreal life, I made a point to see the movie, which I found fascinating as well.I mean, what a story! Redneck skating champion wearing toomany sequins and acting too athletic, dissed by the girls-gotta-be-prettyskating establishment, prompts an attack on her rival, the dazzling dream girlin the white lace dress. We have the sleazy boyfriend, the thug with the policebaton, the semiliterate bodyguard, and the giant stage of the top athleticcompetition in the world. We have the bar owner who checks her dumpster forunauthorized trash and finds incriminating notes in redneck skater’shandwriting. I mean, my God. I was riveted to every report, having long been afan of Olympic figure skating (ref. Zestful posts 158 and 252). It was especiallythrilling to me that the attack occurred in my home zone of Detroit, in CoboArena. I still remember that Shane Stant was reported to have stayed in theSuper 8 motel on Middlebelt Road next to Detroit Metro Airport, mere yards awayfrom the impact point of Northwest Airlines flight 255, which crashed in 1987,killing all aboard but one little girl. Another compelling story, albeit not acriminal one.The other day I read an amazingly sensitive profile on Tonya written by Taffy Brodesser-Akner in the January 10, 2018 New York Times.[Bronze sculpture by Abestenia SaintLeger Eberle (American, Webster City, Iowa 1878–1942 New York), 1906. It’s a public-domain image; what can I say?]The writer sat down with Tonya and took her seriously, andgot a whole lot of the inner Tonya that no one had gotten before. So manylessons here:A caricature is not a person.All you have to do is listen with some measure of respectand yes, compassion.People want to tell their story, but only if they feel they’renot being judged.My truth may not mesh with your truth.Here is a quote from near the end of the article:“A lot of what she said wasn’t true. She contradictedherself endlessly. But she reminded me of other people I’ve known who havesurvived trauma and abuse, and who tell their stories again and again toexplain what happened to them but also to process it themselves. The things shesaid that were false—they were spiritually true, meaning they made her point,and she seemed to believe them.”Isn’t spiritual trutha great term? This is something we as writers need to keep handy. We createcharacters, and they need to seem real. Nobody acts logically all the time;nobody thinks every single thing through before they do it. Nobody can see thebig picture all the time. The big picture for Tonya was, she was surrounded bygoons, and goons can’t do anything right, and they can’t keep their mouths shut. All this is apart from right vs. wrong. Everybody has theirspiritual truth. And pretty much everybody, from the three-year-old who stealsa cookie to the investment banker who builds a Ponzi scheme to the serialkiller who stalks and slaughters as often as possible, feels their behavior is justified,at least at first. Self-justification is a big deal to us humans. We do things,and we want those things to be right. We want to be seen by others as being,always, somehow, in the right. Sometimes we are.It’s easy and fun to paint somebody with one simple stupidcolor. But it’s not the best we can do. I’m not saying perps ought to get afree pass if they’ve had a shitty life. But letting them talk helps usunderstand them. So, keep letting your characters talk to you. Make them sitdown over a beer or coffee and talk to you. Remember the idea of spiritualtruth. Good guys, bad guys. Make them tell you their stories, from thebeginning. Don’t judge them. That’s the job of your readers. When weunderstand, we can create something authentic, nuanced, compelling—and zestful.What do you think?

{"title": "Excerpt from The Business of Being a Writer", "date": "Thursday, March 22, 2018", "text": "Zestful Blog Post #256My friend Jane Friedman, publishing expert and digital-industrythought leader, has just come out with a new book, The Business of Being a Writer (University of Chicago Press).It’s packed with useful stuff for aspiring authors as well as experienced ones.Reading through the galley she sent me, I was struck by this short passage in thefirst chapter:[excerpt begins] …I’ve witnessed many writers hit theirheads against the wall trying to publish or gain acclaim for a particular typeof work, even as they succeed wildly with something else— that they don’t thinkis prestigious or important enough. Getting caught up in prestige is perhapsone of the most destructive inclinations of all. Paul Graham has writtenelegantly on this, comparing prestige to a “powerful magnet that warps evenyour beliefs about what you enjoy. It causes you to work not on what you like,but what you’d like to like.” Avoiding this trap is easier said than done. Mostof us live under the weight of expectations put upon us by parents, teachers,peers, and the larger community. Breaking free of their opinions can beliberating, but what others think of us also contributes to how we form ouridentities. It’s not a problem you can solve as much as acknowledge and manage.Still, if you can at least let go of the many myths about writing, and pursuewhat you truly enjoy with as much as excellence as possible, you can shape awriting life that is not only uniquely your own, but one that has a betterchance of becoming a lifelong career. [excerpt ends]Wise words. They instantly made me think of one of myliterary heroes, Arthur Conan Doyle, enduringly famous for his Sherlock Holmesstories. Besides those stories, perhaps you are familiar with his novel The Tragedy of the Korosko. No? Well then,maybe you’ve read Uncle Bernac. Hm,no? That’s because nobody has. They were heavy-duty historical tomes which,although published, just didn’t get popular. Not much then, not at all now. Butthe Holmes stories struck a deep chord with readers. That didn’t please Doyle!He resented that readers liked his gripping mystery tales over the importantstuff about Uncle Bernac, whoever the hell he was. So he killed off Holmes atthe end of “The Final Problem.” The public outcry was such that he had to bringhim back (“The Hound of the Baskervilles”).Many of us can relate to this. My own fiction is mostlymystery- and crime-type stuff. When I look at big famous literary authors,sometimes I think, well, I should be doing more so-called literary work. Literarywork is defined as having literary merit, and a lot of that consists of social commentary.Hypocrisy is bad—see, I’ve written a novel that shows it. War is bad—see, I’vewritten a novel that shows it. Mean people suck—see, I’ve written a novel thatshows it. Gimme my Pulitzer. Funny how literary fiction so often likes to showus the correct moral path. Which is preaching. Which, unless the author hasreal humility and skill, gets pukey fast.If you can reach readers with a good story that’s well told,while being fully yourself as you write, and having fun along the way—well, isn’tthat ideal? If you’re fully yourself, your writing will feature the things youcherish, which just might include issues like right vs. wrong. The onlydifference is, you won’t be in your readers’ faces, telling them how to think.Far less risk of pukiness. Far more chance of success.Get hold of Jane’s book for more wisdom and solidadvice on building a writing career. If you like it, be sure to put up areview, OK? I’ll be putting one up soon myself.What do you think?

{"title": "Awards Versus Happiness", "date": "Thursday, March 15, 2018", "text": "Zestful Blog Post #255Awards Versus HappinessIf you read this blog, you’re my friend. At some point beforewe’re all dead, I’m gonna send out a newschat, but today you guys will learn alittle bit of news in advance, along with my Facebook friends, who saw thisyesterday. Gonna talk about awards here. If you are an author, especially,please read to the end of this post to get my most heartfelt and useful advice.Last week I learned that Crimes in a Second Language is receiving the silver medal in the Florida Book Awards,general fiction category. Which is nice. But upon hearing the news, I was like,shit! Because I had wanted andexpected gold! That’s how I am: totally confident in my superiority as anauthor. Which, though arguably delusional, has not proved to be any serious handicap.During the most recent cycle of the Olympics, I readsomewhere that psychologists have determined that the least happy medalists arethe ones who get silver. Because of course the gold people are happy that they wonthe top prize, and the bronze people generally are ecstatic that they got amedal at all. The silver people go Awhell, should have gotten the gold! And that was exactly my first reaction to thissilver medal. But I’m over it. I’m gratified that the other two medalists in mycategory were published by major houses in hardcover, while I released Crimes independently, under Spruce ParkPress, my personal imprint. The gold went to Laura Lee Smith for The Ice House (Grove Atlantic) and thebronze went to Randy Wayne White for Mangrove Lightning (Putnam). I hope to meet them both, along with the winners in the other ten categories, at a dinner in Tallahassee next month. Willsomeone actually put the medals around our necks, like at the Olympics? The thoughtmakes me nervous. I’ll report back.I give major credit to the judges for taking my bookseriously and not discounting it because it’s a humble indie. Their identitiesare public information on the FBA web site, so I’m going to thank them here: ChrisCoward, Jennifer Pratt, and Dianna Narciso. All judges are past winners of FBAs.I highly approve of having judges be identified, because it makes the processtransparent. Yeah, I guess an author could try to coddle up to a judge or senda case of Scotch to their house, but the risk of something like that swaying ajudge doesn’t cancel out the benefits of transparency.[From the Florida Book Awards website: The competition is run by the Florida State University Libraries and co-sponsored by the Florida Center for the Book, the State Library andArchives of Florida, the Florida Historical Society, the Florida HumanitiesCouncil, the Florida Literary Arts Coalition, the Florida Library Association, “JustRead, Florida!,” the Florida Association for Media in Education, The Center forLiterature and Theatre @ Miami Dade College, Friends of the Florida StateUniversity Libraries, the Florida Writers Association, and the Florida Chapterof the Mystery Writers of America.]When you think about it, most of us have competed for lotsof things. Grades in school, the affection of a parent, athletic contests andgames, and so much more. Competition is a part of life. Some competitions arecompletely objective. You skate the fastest or you don’t. You jump the highestor you don’t. You earn the most money or you don’t. Then there are the subjective contests, which play so much havoc with artists. Your pirouette spinwasn’t as pretty as hers. Your book wasn’t as good as his.I’ve cursed judging panels when books of mine have beensnubbed and books of inferior quality (in my opinion) given prizes. “Pearlsbefore swine!” is my go-to rant, meaning the judges’ tastes were so coarsethey couldn’t recognize quality when they saw it. I’ve been a judge in literarycontests, and I know how subjective the process can be. (Certain things you canbe objective about: the mechanics of writing, for instance. Then there isliterary merit. Let the brawl begin!)The sad reality is that awards do drive readers’ choices.Just the other day I participated in a group reading with other authors; all ofus had some books for sale. As I was signing a copy of Left Field for a reader, she said, “I bought the one that won theaward!” That copy happened to have a GCLS Goldie sticker on it, one of a bunchthey give you for such use.Some authors get depressed when they don’t win an award, andthat’s just so wrong. Understandable, but wrong. You gotta either get mad for awhile (pearls before swine), or shrug and say, “Who cares?” You cannot let thenon-win affect your self-esteem. It’s the same when a negative review smacks youin the face. The hell with it.So, publish your work, enter competitions, go for the gold,but remember this tremendously important fact: Your work is not you. Your workis your work. It is separate from you. And remember the corollary: A win doesn’tmean you’re special. It means a particular piece of your work was judged to beworthy. That’s all.What do you think?

{"title": "Dishing on Pita Authors", "date": "Thursday, March 8, 2018", "text": "Zestful Blog Post #254We like pita bread with hummus, but we don’t like pitapeople, which stands for Pain In The You Know What.I’ve been thinking about nice vs. pita authors, having beencomplimented lately for being one of the nice ones. It’s easy to figure outthat nice works so much better than pita, especially if you’ve had to deal withpita authors in professional situations. And as a bookseller for ten years, andas an author for many more, I’ve had experience.The first pita author encounter I really remember was when Iwas managing a bookstore in suburban Detroit. The author called up to requestthat my store sell her book after a talk she was scheduled to give in a fewweeks at some nearby venue. I didn’t know her name, but she was local and she hadwritten a book, and it had gotten published, and she was promoting it as bestshe could. She’d gotten a speaking gig with a service group, as I remember, andshe had been told that as many as 200 people would attend.I congratulated her on her book, but said we couldn’t sellher book off-site. “We’re not really set up to do that, I’m afraid.”She was shocked. She had called to offer us this opportunityto make money. “Why not? You’d sell 200 books!”“Well,” I said, “to begin with, the expense wouldn’t reallyjustify—”“Wait a minute. It’d be like two employees at minimum wage.”“We pay our employees above minimum wage. But there areliability issues with having employees off-site, using private vehicles, but I’mreally getting ahead of things, because—”She kept interrupting, never giving me a chance to say:Look, lady. First of all, you’re not going to sell a book to every person whocomes to your event, because you’re not Stephen King or Madonna or MickeyMantle. We would have to guess how many books of yours to order, pay thepublisher or distributor for them, pay for shipping, and of course receive andaccount for the order. We would need to prepare a cash drawer for cashcustomers. We would need to acquire a credit card terminal or disconnect one ofours currently in use in the store, take it to the venue in advance, andinstall a dedicated phone line to handle credit card data processing. We wouldneed to arrange for a table or counter upon which to display the book and dobusiness, and a chair or two for our staff. On the day of the event, hoursahead of the start of your talk, we would need to pull one or two employeesfrom their scheduled work at the store to load the books and supplies into whatever vehiclewe’d figured out to use, give them instructions, and hope for the best. At thevenue, the staff would have to unload the books, cash drawer, and credit cardmachine, make sure the electronics are running right, and call for help if they’renot. After your talk, the staff would sell books. After that, the staff wouldpack up unsold books and everything else, return to the store, and unloadeverything. We would have to box up, arrange for, and pay for shipping toreturn unsold stock to the publisher or distributor. Our gross profit margin ona hardcover book is about fifty-five percent. After normal expenses—staff, rent,supplies—we’re talking about ten percent profit, or a dollar sixty-two cents,if your book is selling for eighteen dollars and we give our standard tenpercent discount on hardcovers. So if we sold a hundred books for you, ourprofit would be a hundred sixty-two dollars. If, as would be much more likely,we sold twenty-five books for you, our profit would be forty dollars and fiftycents. We might mention the cost of installing the phone line at the venue, thewages of the extra staff to cover the work of the regular staff sent to yourevent, and if we took a look at all that, as well as mileage, vehicle expense,and a special insurance rider, lady, we would be paying for the privilege ofselling your book at your event. Have a nice day.[Mamas, don’t let your babies grow up to be pitas. Screengrab from a Microsoft computer TV ad, since I couldn’t use a photo of one of the people I’mtalking about in this post. I'm writing this on a Microsoft device, so yay, Microsoft; be cool with my using this image, OK?][The things we have to think about.]In general, famous people are pretty cool, don’t act likepitas, and say thank you nicely. In general. A super famous artist with a newbook out about her work wanted to do an event at another store I was managing,this one in suburban Chicago. Great, we’d love to have her. Our publicist gother on the phone to set things up and see what we could do—host a reading andsigning, or maybe she’d like to give a lecture, whatever she’d like? The eventdid get set up, although the artist found it necessary to comment on the publicist’sethnicity and guess at her religion as they chatted. In not a friendly way. Theday before the event, the artist phoned the publicist and asked her to buy theatertickets for her, because a very socially important Hollywood movie had justcome out, and she needed to see it, and tickets in this first week of therelease were hard to get. Incredibly to me, the publicist was willing to goover to the theater and buy the tickets the artist wanted. But she objectedthat if the artist went to the movie, she would be terribly late for her event,which had already been in all the papers, posters in the store, etc. The artistdidn’t care. The publicist went out and bought the tickets, the artist went tothe movie, fans of hers showed up on a bitter winter night at the store andwaited for an hour and a half to see her swoop in, stomp the snow off herboots, say a few words (most of which concerned the socially important Hollywoodpicture she had just seen and thought wonderful), sign a few books, and leave.Have a nice day.Then there was the hot young author whose debut literarynovel was rocketing around all the lists and magazines. He did an event at a bookstorein California managed by a subordinate of mine. This was one of the big chains,and I was the regional director. The store manager and her staff put on abeautiful event for this author and his book, drawing in a crowd of about fiftypeople, which is saying something for a debut literary work. There was alittle reception with snacks and coffee. They had a microphone and lectern for theauthor. He gave an entertaining talk, signed dozens of books, and chatted withcustomers. Perfect! As he was leaving, the store manager went over and thankedhim for coming and said she’d enjoyed the evening very much herself. She extendedher hand. He took it, looked her in the eye, and said in a tone that was, asshe recalled, a perfect blend of nastiness and sarcasm, “Kill the independents.”Have a nice day.I could go on. Well, you know, it feels good to dish aboutthis stuff once in a while. I hope you found this pita post educational!

{"title": "Mixing Up Persons", "date": "Thursday, March 1, 2018", "text": "Zestful Blog Post #253In my decades of experience with writers and their associations,I’ve noticed that critique groups are big on finding fault with mixing firstand second person in narrative, whether fiction or nonfiction, because writingguides say you’re not supposed to. Here’s the thing: Writing guides are often likethe tax code: Without rigid rules, the whole thing will fall apart! We cannot permitany discretionary freedom! Because people won’t understand, and they’ll dosomething awful. Then we’ll have to send soldiers to your house.To define our terms in a nutshell: First person is [I], secondperson is [you].Yeah, it’s possible to write terrible material, rule book orno rule book. But if you avoid mixing persons, you can’t go wrong from atechnical standpoint. However! Mixing first and second persons in narrative ordialogue is a matter of common sense. How does it read, how does it sound? Ifyou experiment and let your imagination go free, you can come up with lively,natural-sounding stuff.My poster boy for this is Ernest Hemingway. In his first—andin my opinion, best—novel, The Sun AlsoRises, we find this passage:[We went down the stairs to the café on the ground floor. I haddiscovered that was the best way to get rid of friends. Once you had a drinkall you had to say was: “Well, I’ve got to get back and get off some cables,”and it was done.](‘getting off some cables’ meaning, in olden times, sendingnews reportage via telegraph.)The novel is written in first person, but the narrator,Jake, moves easily to second person when it sounds right, as again in thisdescription of the Spanish countryside viewed from a bus:[There were signs on the walls of the churches saying it wasforbidden to play pelota against them, and the houses in the villages had redtiled roofs, and then the road turned off and commenced to climb and we weregoing way up close along a hillside, with a valley below and hills stretchedoff back toward the sea. You couldn’t see the sea. It was too far away.]Let’s unpack this a little bit. The first indication ofperson is the first-person plural ‘we’ [we were going way up]. If Jake had stuckwith first person and told us [I couldn’t see the sea.], we might, upon readingthe sentence and before getting to the next, assume that someone’s head was inhis way. Then, upon reading the next sentence, we might guess that Jake is nearsighted.That would be possible. Or maybe nobody could see the sea from the bus, becauseit was not in view. The reader must guess. And a perceptive, close reader wouldfeel slightly unsettled.Jake could have maintained first person by saying somethinglike: ‘The sea was not in view, being too far away.’ Or: ‘No one on the buscould see the sea, because it was too far away.’But both of those are needlessly stiff. Using ‘you’ inconstructions as Hemingway did is a perfectly good way to craft narrative thatsounds natural, even conversational.If Beatrix Potter were to get reincarnated as a 25-year-old dudewith a Reddit account, she might write:[I slipped under the fence to Mr. McGregor’s garden. He wasin there, pulling back and forth on that long stick with the short spikes on it?Yeah, I have no idea. But I got a couple of carrots. You just have to workfast, while his back is turned. They were awesome carrots.]But if she or anyone were writing a doctoral dissertation on jetpropulsion, the thing would be rigidly in super neutral third person, and itwould be correct, if not natural.[The mixed gases expanded at a greater rate than expected, inthis instance producing a catastrophic failure of the interior aluminum housing.The next test replicated that result.]Fine. Right. Next time the team will adjust the mixture toinclude some polyethylene wadding in a hexagonal configuration, which shouldslow down the burn rate and produce a cleaner level of bullshit.I mix persons all the time in this blog, and I mix them inmy fiction as well. Readers don’t notice; all they care about is whether they’reenjoying what they’re reading.Yes, it’s possible to do a bad job of mixing persons andhaving it be obtrusive or fake-sounding. But it just this second dawned on methat in all the material I’ve evaluated, edited, and judged for aspiringauthors, I don’t think I’ve ever once said, “You know, you should review ausage guide on first and second person, because you seem to have no clue.”Maybe, maybe once or twice I’ve hadto stop somebody from constantly and wildly switching, but it’s just not acommon problem. Except in critique groups.Test your material simply by asking, “Does this soundnatural?” Now go get ya some of them carrots!What do you think?

{"title": "Using Fickle Memory", "date": "Thursday, February 22, 2018", "text": "Zestful Blog Post #252Nearly two years ago, I wrote a post here called \"To the Ballpoint,\" about using ballpoint pens for writing longhand. I reminisced about a TV advertisement for Bic pens, starring theOlympic ice skater Peggy Fleming, and lamented that I couldn’t find the spot onYouTube or anywhere. I recalled in rigorous detail Peggy’s thrillingperformance at the 1968 Olympic games in France, her gold medal,and then the television ad where the Bic pen was strapped to her skate andgiven Olympic-style punishment, with Peggy spinning around as the pen point duginto the ice. Then after the ice, she takes the pen and holds the tip in a panof fire, then writes the amazing word BIC on a large pad of paper. OK, right. Iso wanted to find that commercial on line. But it wasn’t there. I googled “PeggyFleming Bic pen TV” but—nothing. Why, God, why?Just a few days ago, I got a notice that a reader of this blog had put up acomment on that post: “It wasn’t Peggy Fleming. It was Aja Zanova. There is aYouTube video with that commercial.”Iwas stunned. Surely this could not be right. Of course it was Peggy Fleming inthat advertisement. I would have bet every dime I had that the skater in thatad was Peggy Fleming. Not only had I remembered that commercial, some of myother correspondents here remembered it as well. But! I looked it up using AjaZanova’s name, and son of a bitch if it isn’t true! Here’s the the YouTube link! The commercial starts 18 seconds in. Andit is exactly the commercial. The beautiful skater, wearing one of those dresses,the Bic pen strapped to her ankle, the announcer’s cheesily overexcited commentary,the ice chips flying as the pen fairly screams from thepunishment. The unstrapping and holding of the pen point in the pan of fire.Everything.Exceptit isn’t Peggy Freaking Fleming! Who the hell is Aja Zanova??!! Well, she was asuper famous, two two-time world champion from Czechoslovakia, who skatedduring the 1940s and 50s. Here’s her wiki story. Thank you, dear reader MH! Thank you a thousand times forfinding and sharing the truth! The mystery of the missing Peggy Fleming YouTubehad been preying on my mind, just softly, in a far corner, all this time. Ihaven’t been able to ascertain what year the Bic pen commercial debuted. Hey,if anyone can find out that one, I’d be grateful. But isn’t it wild that rightnow, during the winter Olympics 2018, we get definitive word on this?So for the past few days I’ve been thinking intenselyabout memory and its fickleness, and applications of same in fiction. Of course,faulty memory has long been a feature of police/crime stories, where a witnessgets something crucial wrong. (Ripped from the headlines, for sure, as there areany number of real-life situations like this. Thank you, the InnocenceProject.) Too often, though, I’ve seen the technique abused, where the authorjust bails out of a tight spot by employing faulty memory as a cheap twist.If you’re considering using faulty memory in a story, allyou really have to do is make it plausible. But what does that mean?One, give it enough background to make the mistakebelievable. You could actually weave a bit of theme in there, by showingincidents of faulty memory occurring early in the story—laying some groundwork.Two, give the person with the faulty memory a lot ofdepth and detail. Show us the inner thoughts of that character, show how thingsget twisted around. These things take time in real life, usually; let that workto your advantage here.Three, do a bit of ‘method writing,’ drawing on the feelingsyou’ve had when you realized your memory about some specific event or thing waswrong.Four, create significant fallout. A character confrontedwith the truth has choices. They may stubbornly believe they’re right, in spiteof direct, incontrovertible evidence that they’re wrong. This can lead to anendless spin cycle of self-justification for that character, where that momentof wrongness takes over their life, making them incapable of moving forward inany honest way.Or the realization of being wrong can lead that characterto try to make amends. Or to try to create a different reality by alteringevidence, or committing some related crime. Or deciding to get revenge onwhoever showed them up as wrong. Lots and lots of possibilities.I might note that a situation involving faulty memory canbe significant in a plot without having to do with violent crime. It can startwith something like:You borrowed that black turtleneck from me.No, I didn’t.Yes, you did.Or:Remember when I had that idea for…?Yeah, no. That was my idea.No.Yeah.Ah, dig it! What a wonderful world of fiction--and figure skating--lies ahead!What do you think?

{"title": "I Love You", "date": "Thursday, February 15, 2018", "text": "Zestful Blog Post #251I’ve told you before that I love you. Here and therein this blog, as a little tagline, mostly, I’ve done so. Time to say it again: Ilove you.On the first day of class at Ringling College last fall, Itold my students I loved them. This was perhaps ill-advised, as I had just satthrough hours and hours of lectures and presentations for new faculty on how tobehave around students. Things to avoid doing and saying, things that could betaken the wrong way. The experts didn’t specifically forbid telling yourstudents you love them; they probably figured nobody would be that clueless. ButI thought, Just be yourself. Might aswell start now.Context, of course, is a thing. The class laughed when Imade some wry comment, and I was so happy they got it. “I love you,” I said. “Ilove you so much.” Startled, theylaughed at that, too, which was fine. They understood what I meant. Warm humanfeeling. When something similar happens when I’m talking to a group at a conferenceor what have you, I do the same thing. And they get it. Just a little dose ofwarm human feeling.It’s not all business. So much, so much is shelteredbeneath all of our surfaces.Thereit is for today: I love you. You are my friend, and I’m your friend.

{"title": "Wringing Direct Experience", "date": "Thursday, February 8, 2018", "text": "Zestful Blog Post #250I so much don’t want this to be a brag post. Because I hate readingbrag posts, and so do you. I just want to make a point and give somereminder-style advice about getting everything you can from a direct experience.The other day Marcia and I journeyed from our home onFlorida’s Gulf coast to the Kennedy Space Center at Cape Canaveral to witness abit of history: the inaugural test flight of the Falcon Heavy rocket, part ofElon Musk’s SpaceX program to improve rocket science and eventually get humans toMars. Super big rocket, super complicated, with a fun payload of Musk’s Teslacar with a ‘guy’ in a space suit at the wheel. The launch represented a host offirsts, so although it’s a gamble to drive all the way across the state to see aspace shot that could get scrubbed at the last minute, we decided to buytickets and take the risk. (We’d observed a Space Shuttle launch for free froma grassy knoll in Titusville, but this time we wanted—apart from a closerexperience—nice washrooms and the opportunity to buy and consume hot loadednachos.)And yeah! The launch was fabulous, but I won’t bore you withthe blow-by-blow. [Delete: Yeah, first we got gas at that Chevron over by the café,then, you know, the weather was pretty nice, and like the traffic was reallyheavy the closer we got to the center, you know, and we tried to see the rocketfrom the causeway but we weren’t sure which thing sticking up in the distancewas it, plus there was some haze at that hour of the morning…] Delete deleteSo what’s the point of this post?1)     Tobe alive to the vastness of experience.2)     Togo after it.3)     Toimprove your abilities to extrapolate and synthesize. This is the piece ofgreatest importance for writers.To illustrate, no blow-by-blow, but here’s a partial list ofmy experiences and impressions from launch day:Cursing endlessly at the drivers who disobeyed the signs androared ahead of us rule-followers queuing up for miles in the right lane as told.Entertaining Marcia with inventive curses. Hatred surging in my heart for peoplewho cut ahead, but not debilitating hatred.Is that a great blue heron? Or a crane? You’d think there’dbe gators in that big ditch.Gigantic guy in a gigantic back brace.Smells of cooking hot dogs. Yeah, nachos. More sunscreen.Woodstockian sea of people looking in one direction, overthe roofline of the IMAX building, knowing it isn’t time yet.Little girl in astronaut jumpsuit walking through the crowdwith head high, hoping to be taken for a real astronaut.Anxiety. T-minus keeps getting longer.Murmurs. Shouts. Adrenaline. Tachycardia.The brightest fire in the world! A rend in the fabric ofreality!Sonic booms, plural!! Sternum vibrations. Dude!My God. My God. Look at that.Face wet with tears. Friendship 7. The things imagined, thethings made real.A French fry plopping at my feet from the sky, having presumablybeen dropped by an overstimulated gull.The point is, there’s so much waiting for you that you don’texpect. Space shots are extraordinary, and not everybody gets a chance to seeone. But lots of other stuff happens that you can get out for and find way morethan what’s front and center. City council meetings. Climb that hill, just forkicks. Ballgames. Prune that cherry tree. The movies. The lumpy blanket in theback seat. The sound of the cork popping, the cookie crumbling, the cows cominghome. The look on that woman’s face when her boyfriend whispers to her. The guyon the ladder throwing a hammer to the guy on the roof. The grace of the catch!The feel of the breeze: What side of your face feels it? The young studentcopying the Vermeer in the museum, her easel and paints, tiny green splash onher white sneaker. The fear in that foreman’s voice. Scrape the ice off yourwindshield. Close your eyes. The dogs say goodnight.1)     Sayyes.2)     Writebits of it down.3)     Drawit. Try.4)     Sayyes again.5)     Andagain.6)     Takeeverything with you as you set to work.When you practice feeling the whole of an experience, youcan better bring detail to what you write, and you can better invent details withwhich to deepen your writing.On this rocket day, I made notes in my journal, drew crummy picturesto help myself remember. Pencil shavings in the grass. Took some pictures with my phone camera. Butit’s the stuff in graphite on paper that’s gonna endure. That’s the stuff you’regoing to want to go back and look at. It’s so simple.We have so much on our minds. Don’t forget to be here asfully as you can. I’m not saying anything new. But I’m saying it my way, dammit.Writers, feel it all. Say yes to it all. And capture a highlight or two. Or alowlight. Whatever is distinct. Do it in a word, a line. Don’t stress over it. Ifit’s not fun, decide that it’s fun.What do you think?

{"title": "Giving Characters Credit", "date": "Thursday, February 1, 2018", "text": "Zestful Blog Post #249Our characters can open their own American Express accounts,but they need us to give them the credit they deserve for complexity andincomplete intelligence.It’s impossible to know everything, so it followsthat it’s impossible to acquire and apply all knowledge and all skills in allways. We agree: There are ravines in everybody’s knowledge and skill set. But itfollows that there are also odd peaks. Sometimes those peaks are unexpected.Fictional characters are the same. We learn from life.I told my Ringling College students the following little story lastterm and realized I should share it here too. I was walking through a parkinglot next to a marina and noticed a couple of guys struggling with a boat on atrailer. Seems they were trying to secure it properly. The guys were the dirt-baggiest,crummiest-looking, gap-toothed pair I’d seen in a while. Ragged clothes, grimyhands, greasy hair, dangling cigarettes. The pickup and trailer were a filthy,rusty mess, and the boat looked like it might have been seaworthy when AdmiralFarragut was firing on New Orleans.Something slipped with a clunk, and one guy said, “Hey! Youass, it goes the other way.”The other guy said, “Don’t call me an ass.”The first guy said, “I was speaking metaphorically.”As God is my witness.[Thesteely gaze, the brass buttons… what can you shout but “Farragut!”]  Too many of us, when writing characters and dialogue,oversimplify. A dirtbag kind of guy wouldn’t know the word ‘metaphorical’, letalone use it properly in a sentence, right? Yeah no, wrong. He certainly might.He might not know who Admiral Farragut was; then again he might. He might beable to calculate pinochle scores in his head, but he might waste all his moneyon lottery tickets. But if he does, he might not be able to bear his kids nothaving shoes that fit, so he starts dealing a little meth on the side, so theycan wear decent sneakers. Who knows? Maybe he’s going to night school forelectronics.By the same token, a character who is smart and accomplishedmight not be able to chop onions properly. Might borrow money at rates only afool would agree to. Might get a pilot’s license, then decide to keep going inthe fog at low altitude because it’s only a little ways to the airstrip. Might insiston getting a prescription for antibiotics when sick with the flu.A while back, I encountered disagreement from some writingfriends as to whether a six-year-old boy would know and use the word ‘masculine’.There’s no hard rule, because it depends! If he’s heard it at home orsomewhere, yeah, he certainly could know and use the word. If not, not.Grab the freedom to let your characters be as complex andcontradictory as the people you meet in life. Therein lies authenticity.What are your experiences with this subject?

{"title": "Talkin Proper", "date": "Thursday, January 25, 2018", "text": "Zestful Blog Post #248Quickie note on last week’s blog post, “The Jesus Trigger.”Two unsubscribes, which actually creates a nice set of bookends for the subject,given that I discussed both ends of the “I take offense” spectrum: theallergic-to-neutral-or-positive-references-to-Jesus readers and theallergic-to-cursing ones. The post garnered the most comments, I believe, ofany of my posts so far. So, yeah. Bein’ real, livin’ on the edge here atZestful Writing. And to you latest five, yes FIVE new subscribers, welcome to our wonderful corner of the literary galaxy!Onward. I never cease to be bothered by common misspellings,but I also grieve over common mispronunciations, which are, I realize,occasionally related to misspellings, or perhaps more accurately, misperceptions of a given word. Internationalcuisine offers plentiful opportunities.For instance, I’ve had waiter after waiter tell me that thetiramisu (so far, so good) is made with “marscapone” cheese. It is not. It ismade with mascarpone cheese. Therefore it is not pronounced mar-ska-pone. It ismass-kar-pone.[You can practically taste all those luscious ingredients,can’t you?Even the cocoa sprinkled on top. [Sketch by ES]]I feel better already. Going on:Haven’t nearly all of us considered ordering a tasty Salade Niçoise when out lunchingwith friends? Certainly we have. And if you had to pass your languagerequirement in graduate school and selected French, you know that an E on theend of a word ending in S nearly always calls for that S to be pronounced.Therefore I tell the server, “I’ll have the Salade Nee-swahzz.” I’ve found thatunless the waiter is an actual French person, they will repeat my order smugly,“Salade Nee-swah.” No, bitch. It’s Nee-swahzz. I cannot well represent the tinylittle miniature [euh] that I sometimes add on the very end, for emphasis, butyou can’t go wrong with Nee-swahzz.Is sherbert for sherbet a dead horse by now? I hope so. Just one R inthere. It was Marcia’s aunt Nancy who, when corrected that way, said,tentatively, “Sheebert?” Side note: Sherbet, which contains some milk, is notthe same as sorbet, which does not.We know that someone who runs an eatery is not a restauranteurbut a restaurateur, oui? No N in there.Leaving the food world, as is my prerogative, we—oh! Wait!Yes indeed. It’s not perogative. So, not peh-rog-a-tive. We rightly say pre-rog-a-tive.Or you could go with pruh-rog-a-tive for an extra level of tweediness.Has this post been succinct or what? Yes, it has beensuck-sinkt! It has not been suss-inkt. Never that. The double C is pretty muchalways pronounced with a K-moving-to-S sound in there. Accent. Eccentric. Andyes, even flaccid, ref.

{"title": "The Jesus Trigger", "date": "Thursday, January 18, 2018", "text": "Zestful Blog Post #247Indulge me today. Just indulge me.I’ve brought up the name of various lords (or Lords, if youlike) several times in this blog. Whenever I mention Jesus, I always get anunsubscribe notice for exactly one person. Never two, three, more, or zero.It’s funny, it happens whether I take the name of Jesus or God in vain, such astwo weeks ago, when I wrote “But do you see how goddamned entertaining andenjoyable it is to read closely?”, or whether I mention Jesus or Christ in anysort of positive or neutral way, in the in the context of one of my metaphysical-typeposts. No one seems to object to the mention of Buddha, or any ancient gods/goddessesI’ve mentioned, like Athena. None of the unsubscribers sends me any sort of messageof explanation, but they really don’t have to, because the correlation seems sodistinct. Sometimes I wonder what they’re thinking when they make the decision.Like, “Eww, she said something about Jesus! I am so allergicto that Christian thing! Because there are so many hypocritical Christians outthere who are actually fascists and everything!! Any reference to thehistorical Jesus is surely—somehow—an attempt to proselytize, or as a signalthat proselytization is about to occur!! Bad blogger! Lemme outta here!”Or like, “Eww, she cursed!! I am so allergic to cursing! Icondemn cursing! This person is ungodly and perhaps even dangerous! I myself amdevoted to clean language, and I myself will go to heaven if I keep doingthings right!! This blogger and I have nothing in common! Bad blogger! Lemmeoutta here!”Seriously, unsubscriber? You’ve been enjoying this blog, yetnow you’re tapping ‘unsubscribe’ because—your identity is that tenuous? Youhave to protect your bubble so reactively that you’re foregoing the wholeexperience of Zestful Writing? You can’t just shrug off the bits you don’t like?Is there something I’m just not getting?[Pagan piñata about to be busted during a Catholic festival in Mexico. Yes! Piñataswere used by the Aztecs to celebrate the birthday of Huitzilopochtli. Youremember that popular war god, right?! [photo by ES]]I swear and use vulgar language fairly liberally in reallife. (If you’ve ever spent so much as half an hour with me over a cup of coffeeor glass of wine, you’re like, yeah, Elizabeth, no shit.) And I put curse wordsand vulgar talk in the mouths of some of my fictional characters, especially myfirst-person ones. Why? For one thing, it’s a comfort zone, and bad languagecan break tension in a scene, or even add humor. And I feel it’s only honest topermit my characters to swear because Iswear, and I feel it’s only honest for me to swear occasionally in this blog.Last week, in the context of reviewing the writing app Floor23, I wrote out a Catholic children’s prayer that came to mind. You might concludethat I was brought up in a Catholic household, and you would be right. However,my parents, apart from attending church, for years owned and operated tavernsin working-class neighborhoods. And we lived in a working-class neighborhood. Soguess where I learned the prayers andthe curses? Right! You might wonder what I believe or practice now. My current religion,if you could call it that, seems to be a mixture of Buddhism, Christianity, andpaganism, sprinkled with some vestigial Catholic devotional practices.I know writers who swear in real life but who eschew it intheir fiction because they don’t want to alienate readers. Heck, I know Jewishwriters who say things like, “for Christ’s sake!” but who wouldn’t put thosewords into the mouths of their characters. I can understand that. I’ve lostreaders because of the language I use. Some have scolded me either via email orin an online review (or both—so proud of themselves). And maybe someday I’lllaunch a newer, cleaner series where nobody swears, not even the lowlifes. Ishudder, but it could be an interesting challenge.Well, I have no particular conclusion to offer here. It’sjust funny how the Christian God/Jesus is such a trigger, on both ends of theoffense spectrum. Funny as hell.What do you think? Did this post make you uncomfortable? If you’re a writer, do you consciouslyuse or avoid bad language? Reasons? I’m interested.

{"title": "Review of Floor 23 Writing App", "date": "Thursday, January 11, 2018", "text": "Zestful Blog Post #246I got an email the other day from a nice fellow named PatrickKrabeepetcharat inviting me to try an evidently very new writing app called Floor 23. In his words, “Floor 23 is a super minimalist writing app that aimsto maximize your creative output. As you type, you only see the last fewletters you have written, as the rest floats away, to be edited later. It's a really fun and addictive writing experience that I really hope you willtry for yourself.”That is the perfect description, I found. This morning Iwent over to the app and signed in with Google (other options were Facebook andemail). I thought for a few minutes of some kind of story, and the words ‘guardianangel’ popped into my mind, and I thought about a lonely angel, so I startedthere. Within seconds I was underway. It’s incredibly simple to navigate, easyto start, and kind of hypnotic once you get going. I shifted betweenwriting the story itself, random thoughts on the story and elements of it, andthe experience of using Floor 23.I set a goal of 300 words, and had them within about 15 minutes;I regret not having timed myself. I am sure that I wound up writing 667 wordsin less than half an hour. As you type, a few white letters appear on the blackbackground and swipe away from right to left as fast as you can go. If you pause on one letter, that letter appears alone. If you pause after a space, the screen is blank. The appkeeps track of your word count and that’s it. When you’re done, you can hit ‘saveto clipboard’ and then paste it into a Word doc or whatever. The font isHelvetica. [edit 1/13/18: It's not Helvetica, it's Geomanist.] As you’ll see if you read through my story start, you can’tbackspace over a typo; you’re forced to keep going forward. I found thatannoying, but of course that’s the point. Microsoft Word automatic conventions,like auto-indent, auto-capitalize of the word ‘I’, and automatic em dash aftertwo hyphens, do not translate. I found this annoying as well, because I’m soused to those little helps, but I realize that’s the tradeoff for enforcedforward motion. Maybe future versions of Floor 23 will allow for such conveniences.[My Microsoft Surface Pro 4 with the start of a sentence inFloor 23. I often prop the device on a slant board, which brings the screenhigher and puts my hands in a fairly, though not totally, neutral position.Yes, that’s a Waffle House coffee mug, is there a problem?]The app’s main page doesn’t tell any origin story, or why it’scalled Floor 23, or who Patrick Krabeepetcharat is. It does tell how much itcosts, $3 per month (always genius to create a subscription app), and it offersa free 2-week trial, “no credit card,” which I appreciated. If I’d had to entermy credit card into just to try it free, I wouldn’t have. Now here’s my writingsession from an hour ago, exactly as written. After that you’ll find my bottomline on this app.Ok, the title its LonelyGuardian Angel. I'm a guardian and i'm an angel. Walking the streets with noone to guard. This is weird, but I i get it.Once you relax into it, I thinkthis could work pretty welll. There's no backspacing or anything , but let'ssee if I can make wawhat used to be known as a carriage return. New paragraph.New graph. I remember learning the prayer for your guardianangel at my mother's knee. \"Angel of God, guardian dear, to whom God'slove commits me here, ever this day be at my side, to light, to guard, to rule,and to guide. Amen.\" That is the prayer I guess little Cahtholic kidslearn when they're very young. Do young children still learn that prayer? Whenyou'rel little, you have a guardian angel; when you're big, you can be one.Can you? This is how I write generally, mixing random, or related,thoughts in with what ever story I'm trying to tell, or explore, or get at theheart of.Ah, I wonder how long this is taking. Man, not long. I think it's beenabout 10 minutes, and boy crikey, I got over 200 words. Of course, these wordsare sessentially trash, but in here , in here somewhere, always lies thebeginning, some acorn, some seed. I was going to tell a story, but it lookslike I'm exploring a character. A person--guy? Gal?who wants to serve. Not partof the Guardian Angel organization that provides security in some places, somecities--k do they still do that? I've never seen one. In real life, I'd bemoving on from this stream of consciouslness about now, so yearh. What I wantis to see how dialogue will work here.\"So testit out,\" said a little voice.Carriage return. New line, new graph? \"OK,\" says I.The streets are cold and empty. It dawns o on me that I mightneed to find somebody to guard. I was on a bus , you know the crosstown 38 oncewhen I thin / thought a dude might ebe a terrorist, and man, did my adrenalinesurge. I got ready to defend the people on the bus from this guy, who mighthave had an explosive vest on. As soon as he stood up to get off--no, he stoodup with meaning in his eyes and determination in his manner. I got up too, andmoved toward him, cuz I was gonna do the sacfifice hug. But he just turned andgot off the bus. I didn't follow him, because who knew if there was some otherterrorist on the bus, ready to explode HIS ver vest.When iI know I've made alittle typo, whic I Im I'm seeming to do a lot here, because somehow I feelthis pressure to type fast. Invisible pressure, yes. But when a typo occurs,when typing normally, I immediately backspace to fix it, almost always. I'mthinking about all the corrections I'll need to do to this piece, or would needto t do to it if I wanted to. I can see how this app could really helop awriter keep the flow going. Whether you're a newbie or an oldbie. $3 a month?getting my abacus out I see that equals $36 per year. Maybe worth it. I do likeDragon Naturally speaking, but you need privacy to write, unless you reallydon't care about being overheard as you expl expose your odd fits and starts.It certainly would be possible for someone looking over my shoulder to readwhat's being written, though you'd really have to pay pretty close attention.So I can see this app as a possible alternative, or supplement , to ordinarytyping in a Word doc, or talking into Dragon's c microphone.The End.For anyone who has ever doubted my bravery, ask this: Who among us would post such a piece of writing for public view?Pros:Enforced forward motion in writing.Extremely simple and easy to use.No glitches in copying text to clipboard for pasting into adocument.Con (just one):Microsoft Word automatic conventions are not supported.(Note: no backspace function is not a con, it’s a feature.)Bottom line: Floor 23 is a very cool app that deliversexactly what it promises. If you don’t mind a fairly heavy edit process inexchange for enforced forward motion, this app is for you. If you’re thinkingabout NaNoWriMo, yeah. I might add that I, personally, would expect myraw output with this app to get better over time, as I feel more comfortableslowing down and typing with more accuracy. I intend to use it more, thendecide if I want to subscribe.And what do you think?

{"title": "Close Reading 5", "date": "Thursday, January 4, 2018", "text": "Zestful Blog Post #245My friend Jay, who is a change ringer, turned me on toDorothy Sayers’s The Nine Tailors,which features change ringing. (Change ringing is a form of church-bell ringing,where an array of tuned tower bells is rung by a team of pullers, or ringers,in precise mathematical sequences. The effect can be hypnotic and possibly eventranscendent, as prolonged, repetitive chanting can be in many religiouscultures.)I’m just getting going on this read, and am ashamed that I haven’tdevoured anything by Sayers before now, in spite of recommendations fromknowledgeable friends. Almost as soon as I started this one, I knew I had to doa Close Reading on it. I’m only on page 49 out of 397, and I haven’t read anyplot summaries, so I’m still a virgin reader to the story. OK, we’re going to discuss one little word in the followingexcerpt, from page 7:[excerpt begins]“My dear sir, pray don’t think twice about it. Not but what Iam sure Mrs. Tebbutt here would be delighted to take you in and would make youvery comfortable—very comfortable indeed; but her husband is laid up with thisdreadful influenza—we are suffering from quite an epidemic of it, I am sorry tosay—and I fear it would not be altogether convenient, would it, Mrs. Tebbutt?”“Well, sir, I don’t know as how we could manage very well,under the circumstances, and the Red Cow has only one room—”“Oh, no,” said the clergyman, quickly, “not the Red Cow;Mrs. Donnington has visitors already. Indeed, I will take no denial. You mustpositively come along to the Rectory. We have ample accommodation—too much,indeed, too much. My name, by the way, is Venables—I should have mentioned itearlier. I am, as you will have gathered, rector of the parish.”[excerpt ends] The key word here is ‘quickly’. Did you note that? A tinygranule of the story—but instantly telling. Many readers would skip right overthat inconsequential little word, buried as it is among all the verbiage beingspewed by the clergyman. Careless philistines, such readers would be, butperceptive ones will pause and think.Hm, OK. There’s a reason the rector doesn’t want the visitor—asit happens, Sayers’s serial character Lord Peter Wimsey—to go to the Red Cowinn. Further reflection yields the possibility that perhaps the Red Cow is ofno significance, but that perhaps the rector wants the stranger to come withhim instead of anywhere else. We don’t know which possibility is right, and wedon’t know what the reason is, but we know there is one. So we are on a littlebit of alert with this rector. We shall watch him, and we shall attempt todiscern his motive for keeping the stranger either away from the Red Cow, orwith him in his rectory, on this evening.[I might note that Sayers is as much a stylist as she is atechnician. Some gorgeous prose to be enjoyed in this book, besides the moreworkaday passage we’re discussing here…]We know that the author might have thrown that little adjectivein as a false clue, so we must withhold judging the rector as treacherous rightaway, and on that basis alone. And it’s also possible that the rector has asecret yet benevolent reason to steer Lord Peter one way or another tonight. Wedo not wish to be made fools of!But do you see how goddamned entertaining and enjoyable itis to read closely? We are really matching wits twice over: with thecharacters, and with the author. Because we wonder what the author’s motive ishere: To clarify or obfuscate? To enlighten or temporarily confuse? To reward orto trick? Whatever the case, we know the author is thinking about us as well asher story. And so, engaged, we read on, our intellectual senses whetted,knowing we’re being considered equals.The takeaway for readers is that attentiveness is alwaysrewarded, when the author is a trusted professional. And for authors—the powerof a word! One word, to color a moment, to intrigue the reader, to direct yourstory, if only a tiny bit!

{"title": "Time for Change", "date": "Thursday, December 28, 2017", "text": "Zestful Blog Post #244All of my New Year’s resolutions have to do with writing,publishing, and teaching, and all of them are basically “achieve more.” Oh, andplus “somehow make a million dollars.”We are all the main character of our own lives. But let’sfirst talk about writing fiction. Part of what makes a character compelling ishow they respond/react to change. Here are some ways to spark a character tochange:-       Give the outside world some agency. A layoff, anaward, a subpoena, a snowstorm, a tantrum in the cafeteria, a marketcorrection, a fortune cookie.-       Give the body itself some agency. An infectedtooth or toe, a false positive, a false negative, baldness, wrinkles, aninexplicable rush of lust or passion at first sight, new muscles from exercise,flab from too much beer, a forgotten wallet.-       Create internal motivators. Realizations andresolutions occur when a character pauses to consider and decide—and possiblychallenge beliefs and assumptions. Any of these things could involve years orseconds.o  I just found a syringe with blood in it under mydaughter’s bed.o  I’ve let laziness creep into my life.o  Hey, that guy just grabbed that woman’s purse!o  I wonder what an injection of heroin feels like.o  As soon as I paid for his silence, I was a differentperson.  By the way, the writing/reading website Booksie sent this alongrecently.Zestful Writing says thanks, Booksie users of 2017!Characters react, respond, grow, shrink, deceive others andthemselves. When you remember that every character has the power of choice, rationalor not, you have everything you need to create magic on the page.So hey, it’s a new year. We all have the power of choice aswell, with its potential to create magic in the real world. How about this as asimple resolution:I will recognize and apply my power of choice to best benefit.What do you think?

{"title": "The Edge, the Fail, the Fun?", "date": "Thursday, December 21, 2017", "text": "Zestful Blog Post #243Earlier this year a friend called to see if I’d beinterested in writing some marketing copy for a product line she was workingwith. The money was attractive, the work wouldn’t take a lot of time, and I feltI could produce quality copy, so I said sure. (Not gonna mention product orcompany, cuz confidentiality.)“We want to be edgier than we’ve been up to now,” she said. Withthat in mind I wrote up a few ideas. After she reviewed them, my friend seemedconcerned that the material was tooedgy.I said, “Well, you don’t really know where the edge is untilyou go over it and have a fail.” The concept wasn’t new, but I felt it worthmentioning. “Therefore,” I went on, “you have to be ready to accept andtolerate a failure. Then you know.”Push through to failure, learn from the fail, let the failsuggest and help shape the next thing—early humans were doing this before theycould paint horses on cave walls. But I got to thinking about writing, andbeing in the writing biz. For us as for almost everybody, it’s easier to avoidrisk than court it. If a story succeeds, why not just write that same one—essentially—overand over? Imitate what others are doing. If you see something that looks likean edge, pull back. Why not watch and wait, and let somebody else go over itfirst?Because if they find an air current and start to soar, you’llbe standing there wishing you’d had the guts. If they plunge down onto therocks, you might feel relieved, but sooner or later you know they’re gonna crawlback up to the top. They’ll be wiser, plus they’ll have a tale of survival totell…and perhaps monetize.[Where are the edges here? Hm, maybe they dependon one's point of view… [photo by ES]]The edge isn’t in the same place for everybody. And thereare different classes and categories of edges, if you think about it. And hey,a scary edge could turn out to be false when you really get close, and you see there’s just a little gap that youcan leap easily, or build a little bridge with yonder log. We all know thesethings deep down.What’s the definition of edge, for the likes of us? It’s theplace beyond which your end users will not go. The place where you start tolose more readers than you gain. That might be OK, depending on what you want.

{"title": "What My Students Taught Me", "date": "Thursday, December 14, 2017", "text": "Zestful Blog Post #242As you may know, I’ve been teaching short story writing atRingling College of Art and Design. Fall term is over; I’m calculating finalgrades for my class of second- and fourth-year students.It often happens, and I feel it should happen, that ateacher learns from her students. I certainly have learned a bunch from theprivate writing clients I’ve worked with, so I expected to come away withlessons from these 16 young people. Here are some:·      The students at Ringling seem to be more matureand self-directed than the ones at other schools who get bad press with theirpublic tantrums about political and social issues. I believe this is because theRingling application process is pretty grueling, meaning they really have toknow what they want. They want to develop their talent concretely andspecifically, and they want to explore other possibilities, with the intentionof making their independent way in the world. While they care about politicaland social issues, their focus is on the business of getting an education.·      Students whose first language was not Englishwere, at first, worrisome to me, as they were unfamiliar with the Westernliterary canon, idiomatic American English, and indeed large swaths of Americanand Western culture. I was concerned that their relatively limited experiencewith English would hamper their expressiveness. I was happily wrong. Theirstorytelling skills were no worse, in general, than the native Englishspeakers. Their grammar and vocabulary weren’t very advanced, but they made upfor it by tapping into their own culture and language structures, with theresults being, often, beautiful, poetic, and unique. At times their work waseven more inventive than native English speakers, because they figured out word,phrase, and sentence constructions on their own:o  A dog leash is a ‘pet rope.’o  The moon isn’t at its apex, it’s ‘right at thetop of the sky.’o  A frightened man isn’t pale, he ‘looks like apeeled onion.’o  ‘Her eyes swallowed ashes and spitted death.’·      When you’re standing before a class of artstudents, talking and writing things on the board and answering questions, yourealize that sometimes they’re taking notes, and other times they’re sketching you.·      And sometimes they’re making other art, as inthe photo below. “My parting gift to you,” a student said.[The Florida art school version of ‘an apple for theteacher.’ Thank you, FC. Photo by ES]·      In writing their stories, some students wantedto go big, and they wrote outlandish ideas that didn’t connect. I realized thatgoing deep with your characters first is the only thing that can lay propergroundwork for big splashy drama. Because if readers don’t know the characters deeply,all the gunpowder in the world—or all the supernatural outer-space mind controlin the galaxy—can’t make them engage and care.·      In spite of their talent, there was a lot aboutstory my students didn’t know, and a lot about how to read stories that they didn’t know. If I teach this class again, I’llspend more time helping them interpret what they read.·      Making art and commerce work together, i.e.doing what you love, developing it, and coaxing it to pay well—that’s a fineoutcome for these students to strive after.·      And for us writers too, no?What do you think?

{"title": "Politics and Religion? Seriously?", "date": "Thursday, November 16, 2017", "text": "Zestful Blog Post #238Writer’s Digest magazine has just published a feature Iwrote called “Should You Go There?” It concerns writing about politics andreligion in your fiction—how to decide if you should do it, and how to handleit if you want to give it a go. As we in the U.S. are about to celebrateThanksgiving—a holiday when families meet, eat, and sometimes squabble, I thoughtit would be appropriate to excerpt some of the article for today’s ZestfulWriting post:Most of us learn fairly early in life that starting adiscussion about politics or religion with a stranger will lead to one of threethings: cheerful agreement; silence ranging from uncomfortable to icy;disagreement ranging from mild contradiction to fisticuffs. The odds vary.But what if you’re a writer of fiction? If your workgets out into the world, it/you will be ‘talking’ to strangers all the time.Why do so many authors shy away from dealing with politicsand religion? Several good reasons:► Those subjects are loaded with strong emotion. Manyof us picked up religious and political tenets at a young age—or rejected them.In maturity, you figure things out for yourself, and it can be a complex road.► It’s hard to be well informed, and impossible to beperfectly informed. Nobody has witnessed every conflict, read every historybook, examined every religious text, and prayed to every god.► Religious and political references—especiallypolitical—can date a work of fiction. Which can be fine if you’re writing aCivil War romance and somebody swears “by the President’s beard!” But if you’rewriting a contemporary novel and a character condemns “that guy in the WhiteHouse”—well, in a year or few, nobody’s going to be sure who that character istalking about. And using the names of real political or religious leaderstimestamps your work from the start.► Readers can become alienated if they feel pressuredor manipulated. They might also write a nasty review or ask for their money back.► Doctrine can be tedious. Hammering on the rightnessof your beliefs in your fiction—by putting your pet dogma into the mouths ofyour characters—gets predictable, and therefore boring, fast.That’s the downside. What’s to be gained by embracingthemes of religion/politics?► Let’s say ten people read your book today. If fiveof them are either left cold or ticked off by your biases, you’ve risked losingthem. However, if the five that remain are precisely the demographic you want,well, then, that’s different. When readers find an author whose work resonateswith their ideology, they can become loyal, die-hard fans.► If you lead an active, engaged life, you feel theimpact of political ideas, of government, of the movements within yourparticular faith or of the movements within other faiths. Therefore, if youwant to write about your world, you may feel moved to explore such themes inyour art. After all, we artists are supposed to be pursuers of all things trueand real. We must find things out for ourselves—and art is our vehicle.► These themes, if done with sensitivity andrestraint, can bring great depth and immediacy to fiction.Let’s look at some fiction that successfully navigatedthese dual minefields—what they did, how they did it, and how you can do ittoo.Realize that theissue is not by itself the story.Upton Sinclair’sprogressive-era novel The Jungleexposed the dreadful conditions in Chicago’s meatpacking industry around theturn of the 20th century. He hit lots of targets in this one, andbecame famous. But the reason the book sold so well was because he wrote a goodstory. The plot follows one man, a dirt-poor Lithuanian immigrant named JurgisRudkus, as he makes his way into the dangerous ‘jungle’ of inhuman workingconditions and slum life of his new country. Sinclair took pains to make Rudkussympathetic—a good man caught in a nightmare of false promises and treachery.However, Rudkus does make mistakes. He permits wishful thinking to overcome hisjudgment, he takes to drink and self-pity—and thus is not entirely angelic, andnot entirely blameless for his pain. Everyone can relate to this!The takeaway: Tracethe story of one person against the odds, and don’t make your herounrealistically perfect for fear that readers will reject the story, saying, “Huh,look, he wasn’t as smart as he should have been.” Perceptive readers will notthrow the baby of your story out with the bathwater of realism; they will appreciatereading about a flawed hero thrown against a series of challenges.Also read: The Last Hurrah by Edwin O’Connor, The Yellow Wallpaper (short story) byCharlotte Perkins Gilman, One Flew Overthe Cuckoo’s Nest by Ken Kesey.[Good old research can always help when tackling these subjects. Here be the reading room at the NY Public Library. How can such a grand place feel cozy at the same time?]Challenge thestatus quo by seeming to support it.FlanneryO’Connor was, personally, as religious as they come, and religion infuses muchof her work. But she never set out to tell readers what to believe. In theenduringly disturbing novel Wise Blood, sheexplores mysticism, madness, courage, and cowardice. Although the thirst forredemption is a major theme, O’Connor also rams home the ugly turns faith cantake: hypocrisy, violent fanaticism, and self-justification/self-deception. Thejourneys of the disillusioned preacher Hazel Motes and the terrifyinglyclueless and increasingly unhinged Enoch Emery are compelling for theirunpredictability and backwoods brutality. Faith is questioned throughout, andanswered in varying degrees of certitude. When one turns against one’s owntribe, humans know on a very elemental level that trouble is just around thecorner.The takeaway: Letyour characters plunge down their spiritual paths, even if zealotry is the endgame. Allow them crises of faith. In real life, believers question themselves;nonbelievers question themselves. A life-changing event can shake a foundation,or create one. Also, be aware that faith and religion are not one and the same.Characters can have lots of spiritual adventure figuring that out.Also read: Black Narcissus by Rumer Godden, The Screwtape Letters by C.S. Lewis, My Name is Asher Lev by Chaim Potok.For the rest of the article, hike out to your local newsstand...What do you think of exploring politics and religion infiction—as a reader or a writer?

{"title": "Guilt-Free Procrastination", "date": "Thursday, November 9, 2017", "text": "Zestful Blog Post #237No day in history has provided humans easier or moreplentiful ways to waste time than the one we’re living now. I don’t have tobegin to enumerate. Writers, I believe, are more vulnerable to time-wastingopportunities than other tribes, because OMG, blank pages. Therefore, anythingwe can do to save time and make life more efficient, we should do. And an easyway for a fiction writer to save time, have fun, and even procrastinate guilt-free (!), is investing an early chunk of time oncharacter naming.When you’ve got a fairly solid idea for a story or novelgoing, and you’re starting to flesh things out—either with an outline or just abunch of pages of stormwriting—that’s the time to create a list of readycharacter names. Because it’s no good to keep writing ‘Cop A’ or ‘Politician B’or even ‘Ingenue’ or ‘Hero.’ For one thing, it’s boring, and for another, there’sno personality to it. It’s like eating a handful of flour along with a raw eggand a little sugar, instead of cooking up a nice little pancake. Sure, youmight create a name for a character only to later think of a better one. But atleast start with some semblance of a usable name.[This is what I think a Norwegian Elkhound probably lookslike, or should.]A name with a little possibility to it helps you visualizethe character as you write. That’s valuable, because it helps you bring thatcharacter to life with more verve and efficiency. And for the same reasons it’sso easy to waste time these days, it’s never been easier to quickly come upwith appropriate character names. You can search on popular Latino boys’ names,traditional Irish surnames, popular Norwegian Elkhound names (yes), American femalenames of the 1920s. Of course, if you want a character who is 25 years old inthe 1920s, search names given to babies in the 1900s. You can get a surprisinglot from just fifteen minutes’ worth of research. Which will stretch easily to halfan hour. Come up with twice as many names as you think you’ll need, becauseminor characters. It’s a good investment.The benefit is, when you start to write about a fictionalperson, you’ve got a list to glance at, choose something from, and keep going.No more discomfort with a generic non-name, and no more interrupting your flowto hurriedly think of a name to plug in, over and over. Then when your story ismore firmed up, you can dig deeper and toy around with character names. Andneedless to say, any names you don’t use this time around might prove worthwhilethe next.Do you have any favorite strategies on character naming?

{"title": "A Good Practice for Writers", "date": "Wednesday, November 1, 2017", "text": "Zestful Blog Post #236If you’re a writer, you’ve got a beautiful field ofresources that will take you far beyond books on technique and motivation: thework of literary innovators. Reading literature that you find fabulous / moving/ amusing / iconoclastic represents your continuing education. Here’s a goodpractice for a professional author:-       Assemble a soft pencil, a sharpener, and a fewindex cards.-       Get hold of a book you’re interested in.-       Read it.-       Underline passages of special interest and makenotes as you go. (You’ll find that soft graphite is easier to erase if you everwant to, doesn’t dig into the pages, and is more pleasurable to use in general.)Write in the margins and on your cards. Make little stars and ticks next topassages you find inspiring, impressive, instructive.-       If the book is wonderful, reread it, carefully.-       Make further notes, or expand on the ones youhave already.-       If your book is not made of paper, use whateverdigital tools you have at your disposal.  Am definitely a Blackwing fan. Sharpener hinge failed; repaired with duct tape. (Yeah, pink duct tape! Home Depot, I think.) Yournotes will be different from anybody else’s notes. Your marginalia may express enthusiasm, surprise, skepticism, or humility. Youwon’t remember everything about the book, or everything about your notes. But here's the thing. The very act of attending to the book this closely will feed and build yourinner well of creativity, facility with words, and understanding. This is oneof those things that are good to do for the sake of the thing itself. Sure, youcan read a book just for kicks. But it doesn’t take much more effort to reallylearn from it.

{"title": "Thing Presence", "date": "Thursday, October 19, 2017", "text": "Zestful Blog Post #234The typewriter in the accompanying photograph is a 1926Underwood 4, so called because the keys are arranged in four rows instead ofthree, which had been more common for typewriters manufactured in earlierdecades. My friend Jay Williams, about whom I’ve written in this blog before, sentit to me as a gift last spring. He’s a typewriter buff, and spends some of histime restoring old machines. He restored this one before sending it to me. Inspite of that, it certainly does still show its age and experience. He and Ihave talked about old things being time machines. Environments can be timemachines too. When Jay talks about climbing a stone bell tower at his church toparticipate in change-ringing, he describes the worn, smooth stone steps andthe cool roughness of the stone walls and the sound that one’s footsteps makeand he feels that that’s the closest he can get to real time travel.When he sent me this machine, I called to thank him, and wespeculated on the machine’s history, and what it might’ve been like to be with thismachine in its early days. This Underwood is a heavy-duty business machine, andthey were costly, so this one most likely was used in an office, perhaps a newspaperoffice. Because Jay is blind, we talked about the sounds and smells and feelsof when this machine was new: The newspaper office almost certainly would havehad more than one machine, and more than one machine going at a time. Thesetypewriters are wonderfully loud and authoritative, entirely mechanical marvels.This one’s frame is cast iron. In that newspaper office there might have beenperfume to smell, cigars and cigarettes, their smoke and their butts and theirashes, there would have been the smell of ink and paper, the squeak of chairsmoving back and forth, perhaps rolling on casters, the sound of the boss’svoice, the copyboys’ voices, the reporters’ voices, telephones ringing,telephones being answered, the scratch of pencil on paper as a phone number andaddress and perhaps a name and other things were written down.It might have been summer, the windows open, the blindscatching a little on the windowframes in the breeze, the sound of engines andrubber tires outside, perhaps the aroma of manure as well, if horses were stillpulling wagons. Footsteps, voices. The sidewalks would be possibly concrete,the streets might still be cobbled, the floor in the newsroom would perhaps beof heavy linoleum that was swept every night by the janitor and polished once aweek.Steampunk? You bet.Having something in the house that is this big and heavy (about30 pounds) and old, and so well worn—it has its own presence. It’s a muchstronger presence than most things we have in our house, frankly. Why is that?Maybe because every part of this machine is authentic. It was designed to do exactlywhat it was supposed to do, without extraneous styling. The only decoration onit is the manufacturer’s name. In the photograph you can see thesideways-mounted bell. You can also see the new drawband Jay installed on themainspring. All the pieces still work, all the parts still do their job. Thereis a tabulation function. There is a lever to select which half of the ribbonyou want to use, the upper half or the lower half. (Many typewriter ribbonswere made with the top half being black and the bottom half being red or viceversa.) There is a lever to select the stencil function, which disengages theribbon, while the carriage moves normally. There is a shift key for uppercaseletters, and there is a shift lock key. There are margin controls and numbers andspecial characters besides the alphabet.There is a gravitas to this machine, is what I’m trying tosay, and the other thing I’m trying to say is that many things have a greaterpresence then we might give them credit for. So much of our world is digital,and so very fast, that spending time with objects on a personal level can beenriching. You know? Something that was designed and made for function andefficiency is to be honored, isn’t it?I say, surround yourself first with empty space, then addthings to it that are well-designed, sincere, and useful or beautiful or both.I’ll be performing Leroy Anderson’s “The Typewriter” on thismachine on October 29, 2017 with the South Shore Symphony Orchestra in Sun CityCenter, Florida. With luck the performance will go well and I’ll want to sharethe video. After that's safely over, I'll install the new ribbon Jay sent with the machine and do some writing on it.What do you havethat is somehow more than the sum of its parts?

{"title": "5 Shocking Things I Learned at This Conference", "date": "Thursday, October 12, 2017", "text": "Zestful Blog Post #233If you’re a faithful reader, you know me, and you already get that this titleis to prove a point. But I will share information I found interesting. Shocking?Maybe.So OK, I’m a member of an organization called NovelistsInc., which is predominantly made up of independently published authors. Theannual conference was last weekend in St. Pete Beach, Florida. I saved money by commuting in every day, but it would have been fun to hangout in the bars with presenters and other writers every night. I attended abunch of sessions and met up with some serious authors, as well as big shots inthe publishing business, notably executives from Amazon and other high-profilecompanies.Here are five highlights:1)     Annualbook sales are second only to television—which I guess means subscriptiontelevision—and higher than games, music, and movies put together. I regret nothaving copied down the actual figures, but I was too busy absorbing the impact, being legitimately and seriously shocked by how much money there is in book sales,especially as compared with other media.2)     Marketingisn’t everything; it’s the only thing. Well, that’s the impression I got fromsome of the sessions, but the message really is that authors must do marketingand promo, no matter who they are, or risk oblivion. If your marketinginitiatives fail, it’s because your product blows. So learn to write wellbefore learning to market well.3)     Almostno one these days understands geometry. I run into this all the time, especiallywith writers, who brag about being mathematically illiterate. In God’s name, it’snot that hard. More than one presenter kept talking about one-dimensionalcharacters or one-dimensional this or that. Does no one remember Descartes?Does no one cherish his memory? He gifted us with the concept ofdimensionality. A point in space has zero dimension, a line has one dimension,a plane has two dimensions, and a solid has three dimensions. A solid movingthrough space represents what we sometimes call the fourth dimension, or time. Tocall a character, for instance, one-dimensional is to call it linear. This isnot what you mean. You are trying to say the character is flat. A flatcharacter is a two-dimensional character. A picture is two-dimensional; it isflat. Something three-dimensional would leap off the page, wouldn’t it? When wewish to say a character or scene or anything else is dull or flat orundeveloped, let us please say it is two-dimensional. Thank you very much forsticking with me through this pet peeve.[This commanding swan was once a gray, uncoordinated cygnet. But it was always a swan. See #6.]  4)     Romance,chick lit, and traditional mystery writers do well keeping profanity andexplicit sex out of their material. One of them said she hears from momswho tell her, “I don’t have to turn off the audio of your book in the car whenI pick up the kids.” Meanwhile, I was surprised to hear a couple of authors ofyoung adult material tell me they put in plenty of profanity and vulgarisms,and even (well protected) sex, and of course the kids love this. It’s justtheir parents and teachers who sometimes have a problem with it. Yet the kidsare the final audience, and they’re supported by adults who perceive the valueof good writing, and writing that speaks to young people with good messages.5)     Top-earningprofessional writers get that way by being efficient, tracking their time,meeting deadlines, and spending money when appropriate—that is, gatheringcollaborators such as cover artists, editors, and publicists, and buyingadvertising and spending money on promotion while keeping a close eye on returnon investment.6)     Oh,and one last thing. So OK, that’s 6 things; sue me. A catchy blog post titlecan earn you a click, but if you don’t deliver what the clicker expects, you mightbe sorry. Bottom line, you have to be yourself, not a cheap huckster. Is thisobvious? Of course, but there are so many voices out there yelling “Look at me,look at me, look at me!” that sometimes a quiet, sincere person begins to doubtthemselves. Don’t doubt yourself.

{"title": "Make the Blunder You Love, Love the Blunder You Make", "date": "Wednesday, October 4, 2017", "text": "Zestful Blog Post #232I’m always fascinated by the idea of deliberateimperfection. Most recently, I was touring Flagler College in St. Augustine,Florida. This was a few months ago. The tour guide directed our attention tothe mosaic tile floor of the rotunda in one of the main buildings. The collegewas built by Henry Flagler, and industrialist who endowed the school andfostered many building projects, both charitable and otherwise, in St.Augustine. The guide told us that Flagler, a religious man in the Christiantradition, ascribed to the same belief that Islamic artists do: only God isperfect, and it is folly for humans to try to imitate God. Thus, if you buildin a mistake or two into your project, you won’t displease God; you’ll be OK.Thus the photograph below, showing a seeming mistake in thetile work of this elaborate and beautiful rotunda. As an artist, this ideashould be comforting, and I find it so. Us writers tend to seek perfection, andworse, expect perfection in our work,and that often holds us back from being productive, and it holds our work backfrom seeing the light of day. It can even hold our work back from being thebest it can be: free-flowing, honest, spirited.[It's in the checkers.] I know I’ve touched on this topic before, but mostly I’vewritten about the fact that we should accept imperfection in ourselves and inour work. I hadn’t thought about inserting deliberate imperfection, just to beon the safe side. The more I think about it, the more I like the idea, and themore, as a creative person, I find it freeing.I do remember receiving some criticism on one of my earlybooks, where the reader or reviewer said it would be better if I didn’t tie upevery loose end. Readers are OK with a little ambiguity. It just occurs to menow that ambiguity is part of the human condition. Perfection is not.This is all a little metaphysical, but I guess I’m in thatkind of mood today. It’s so easy for writers and artists to lose touch withthat inner core that feels and knows so much. It’s too easy for us to close offthat core in order to get business done—in order to handle all the things wehave to handle in life. Now here’s something funny and imperfect: I’m dictatingthis post using a headset microphone and my Dragon software, and I’m sittingnext to my office window. The wind is blowing very hard outside; it’s whistlingacross the window frame and I suppose a little air is whistling right on in. WhenI pause my voice, Dragon hears the wind and types the word will. Will willwill. I’ll leave those mistaken words in. I like the word will, and I like theword yes, and God knows what I’ll write next, but you can bet it will beimperfect.Thank you for being my friend.What do you think?

{"title": "Crying is Beside the Point", "date": "Thursday, September 28, 2017", "text": "Zestful Blog Post #231Not long ago I watched a video of a young boy in a martialarts class trying to break a board. The instructor was on one knee, holding thepiece of wood in his hands, and he was coaching the boy. The rest of the class,all boys around age eight or nine, I guess, were sitting cross-legged in a row,watching. Another instructor stood by.The boy, as he’d been taught, lunged forward, yelled, andstruck the board with his fist. It might be accurate to say he struck at the board. It didn’t break.You pulled that one, the teachers said. Do it again. The boydid. The board didn’t break. The class was riveted in silence.You pulled that one too, said the teacher. The boy triedagain, and the board didn’t break.Why are you crying? asked the teacher. The boy could notarticulate why. He was, of course, embarrassed, afraid, and frustrated. Why areyou crying? the teacher asked again.At last the boy said, it’s hard.Yes. The teachers were compassionate in that wonderful simpleway some men have, and told the transfixed class that it’s all right to cry.You could see in all the other kids’ faces that they knew they could be the guyup there, the one failing to break the board, the one crying. The teachers didn’tcomfort the boy. They didn’t explain anything to the class. It’s all right tocry. If they had told the boy to stop crying, then crying would have become thefocus. Crying is beside the point.To pull a punch is to take away the effort at the lastinstant. In crooked boxing matches, a fighter throws a punch only to take theforce off of it just before it lands, so it looks like he punched thisopponent, only he didn’t really hurt him. To metaphorically pull a punch is tohold back from saying something or doing something completely, honestly. It’s related tochickening out.The instructors encouraged the boy to do it again. Noticethey didn’t say try it again. Do it again. This was the most important elementof this little video clip, to me.It dawned on the boy that he was not going to be permittedto sit down until he broke the board. There was no way out except to succeed. Heset himself, lunged forward, yelled, and broke the board.He had committed. He made a literal breakthrough, and I don’timagine he’ll ever forget the first time he broke a board. He had wanted it tobe easier. It was as easy and as difficult as it was.Commitment, as we see, as we know deep down, takes courage. Wiseachievers learn this for themselves, over and over. The moment the boy musteredhis courage to commit to breaking the board, he committed, he executed, and hesucceeded. There’s belief in there, too, isn’t there? If you doubt the boardwill break, it won’t.As it is with our work, every day. Courage. Don’t think youdon’t need it. Call upon your supply of it. How do you replenish your supply ofcourage? What an idea. Let’s think about that, let’s talk about that. It’s allright to cry.To post your thoughts—and I wish you would—click below whereit says, 'No Comments,' or '2 Comments,' or whatever.

Andtherein lay danger.One night she invited all of her top friends to a party ather house. I got there in the middle of the evening, grabbed a glass of wine,and went to find my hostess. She was standing with a circle of half a dozen friends,talking. When she saw me come up, she smiled and opened her arms and said—loudly,clearly: “Everybody, this is Elizabeth!” And then, in a very serious, approvingtone, “Elizabeth is a pseudo-intellectual!”I stood there silently, as did the crowd. Then I realizedthat, very possibly, my friend did not understand the term. I murmured, “Youjust called me a phony.”“Oh! That’s not what I meant at all!”“The prefix pseudo means fake.”“Oh! Everybody, that’s not what I meant! Elizabeth is very smart! She writes for the paper! I’m sorry, hon.”“That’s all right.” And it was, because I loved my friend,and everybody understood.However, it does bug me when somebody uses a word in anattempt to be linguistically impressive, especially in print. Not long ago, Iread an essay in a magazine about a distinguished, prizewinning novelist. Thewriter of the piece referred to the author as “prosaic.” Instantly, I knew thewriter meant “prolific.” But the writer probably thought about “prose,” andfigured, vaguely, yeah, a lot of prose. Prosaic. Yeah, put that in.This kind of mistake, passed over, I must painfullyemphasize, not only by the writer but by the editor of the magazine, andpossibly a copy editor and proofreader, ina literary magazine, makes me sigh deeply. It does not make me want to setmy hair on fire or throw a hatchet through a window, but it does make me sighdeeply.Prosaic means commonplace; literally like prose, with theimplication that there is no poetry or artistry there. “My wardrobe is prettyprosaic: just jeans and polo shirts.” To be prolific is to be abundantlyproductive. “He’s prolific, having written ten books in five years.”Another error I’ve noticed from time to time is the use of ‘ascetic’for ‘aesthetic.’ They are different words. Ascetic, pronounced ass-HEH-tic, meansto practice severe (usually religious) self-denial. Aesthetic, pronouncedass-THET-ic, means having to do with beauty, or the appreciation of it. “Theaesthetics of the building will be important, as it will be situated on apromontory for all to see.”Now you understand. One more for today: the increasingpractice of using ‘discomforting’ to mean ‘disconcerting.’ The word that’smixing them up is ‘discomfiting,’ which they’ve heard somewhere, and they wantto use it, but at the last second they bail out to ‘discomforting,’ because they’renot really sure about ‘discomfiting,’ and ‘disconcerting’ is entirely beyondthem.To be discomfited is to feel uneasy or embarrassed.To be disconcerted is to feel more deeply uneasy; disturbed.To be discomforted is when somebody steals your pillow.I am, as always, yours in the love of precision.What do you think?

{"title": "Envy is Your Friend", "date": "Thursday, August 31, 2017", "text": "Zestful Blog Post #227Well, I bet that’s a blog post title nobody’s ever usedbefore. Before I get to that, though, here’s a link to an interview of me done by Lynne Bernfield, a Sarasota-area psychotherapist who runs an internet radioshow about creative people. She was particularly interested in the fact thatwhile I always wrote, I didn’t have the drive to be a novelist from a youngage. Actually, I tried to avoid the path of being a fiction writer, buteventually it sort of chased me down. I found Lynne to be a perceptive andthoughtful interviewer, and am grateful to have the chance to tell my story.On to today’s theme. Not long ago, my colleague Ryan G. Van Cleave asked if I’d give him some quotes for an article he was writingfor The Writer, a magazine for, yep,writers. The article (in the August 2017 issue) was about writer’s envy, andRyan interviewed several other authors about the subject as well.Here’s what I said:“For years, I couldn’t even read novels by living authorswho were more successful than me, which was almost everybody. In those days if Iread a novel by a dead guy or gal, I could appreciate it without stress,because at least I could mutter, upon closing the cover, ‘Haha, you’re dead and I’m not!’“Although I’ve envied other writers (and still do), I know I’menvied sometimes. Whenever I realize someone is envious of me, I’m like, ‘You poor dumb shmuck, you have no idea thatmy life is a boiling cauldron of failure and anxiety.’ But I always actsuper-cool and confident.“How to conquer envy? A confident front is half the answer. Theother half is to commit to being the best you can possibly be; to do at leastmost of the things you want to do; to meet and even exceed the goals you setfor your life. Throw regret to the dogs and meet every day without excuse orself-doubt.“Also this: If we say it’s OK to be envious, envy loses itspower. Because everybody is envious at times.” [end of quote]Seriously, the reason envy feels so bad is that we try tosuppress it. After all, it’s one of the Seven Deadly Sins (per WesternChristian canon, though it’s often listed as greed, which really isn’t thesame). And then, because suppression is usually a lousy strategy, we feel guiltywhen we feel envious, which just makes it worse. We feel we shouldn’t beenvious, so if we are envious, thatmakes us just extra crummy people. So we get down on ourselves at the same timewe’re trying to fight the envy, which is just a loser road.[Portrait of Envy by ES]The correct way to approach the issue is to be OK with envy.Hey, welcome it! Make friends with it. As you can see from the photograph ofEnvy I managed to take when we met up recently, Envy might seem fearsome andugly, but look—it’s holding a bouquet! The bouquet is a gift! And it’s for you!Now, how can that be bad? It can’t. It’s good! Envy really has no power at all—it’sjust a big guy who wears lipstick and a little gold skirt and wants to beliked.So my message today is welcome envy if it ever comes around—andall the while, keep working like hell on your own show.What are your thoughts on envy?

{"title": "The Power of Unexpected Story", "date": "Thursday, August 24, 2017", "text": "Zestful Blog Post #226As you may know, I’ve gotten a gig teaching a class in storywriting at Ringling College of Art and Design. Last week, about 15 other new faculty members andI were obliged to attend an all-day orientation session. The agenda looked tedious:presentation after presentation from department heads and support teams, speechafter speech. But first, all of us had to introduce ourselves and say a fewwords about our background and what we’re going to teach.I was a little more than halfway back in the room. I listenedto the intro stories, which all went as expected: “I’m [Firstname Lastname],and I taught [subject matter] at [this college, that university] for [X] years.I got my Ph.D. in [subject] from [alma mater], and I’m just so excited to behere.” A few of my colleagues mumbled or spoke softly, as if afraid someonemight hear them.So you know me, right? I was like, this is gonna be a longday, and already we can use a little relief. About five people before me, Istarted to think about what I’d say. My turn came. I spoke clearly anddeliberately, in a cheerful tone.“I’m Elizabeth Sims. I used to run the liberal artsdepartments at Harvard and the Sorbonne—in Paris.” Heads instantly turned in mydirection and postures straightened. I went on, at the same pace, “I was theboss of both of those programs, at the same time.” Dead, attentive silence.“But I got kicked out of both places because of a series of really juicy sexscandals.” Every last pair of eyes was riveted to me, and people started tolaugh incredulously. “So here I am at this fine institution. And guess whatI’ll be teaching! Story writing! Making up stories. You see how it works.”Full-on, relaxed laughter. “The truth is, I’m an author and writing authority,and I’m a contributing editor at Writer’s Digest magazine. My degrees are fromMichigan State University and Wayne State University—in Detroit. And now on to[name of person sitting next to me].” That person waited a moment for the roomto settle down before resuming the ordinary story format. I hoped strongly tobe one-upped, but nobody tried it.During breaks, some of my colleagues came up to talk. Onesaid, “I want to be in your class!” Another wanted my card so she could have mecome and talk about storytelling to one of her classes. Another asked,anxiously, “Did you plan that? I mean, did you plan that?” Another simply said, in a low, awed tone, “That was great.” Such a tiny little thing; such fun,positive impact! I guess one reason my performance was so impressive was that the top administrators of the college were in the room. Thepeople you’re supposed to really behavein front of.I had already engineered a similar success a few years agowhen, after arthroscopic shoulder surgery, I was sitting in thephysical-therapy waiting room with a few other patients. Everyone starteddiscussing why they were there: knee replacement, knee replacement, wristtendon. I nodded sympathetically until they all turned, politely, to me. Igestured to my sling and explained that my arm had been torn off in a terriblecar wreck, but doctors had reattached it during a grueling 17-hour operation.Judging by their slowly widening eyes and dropping jaws, I could have gone onabout how I stanched the bleeding myself and used the severed arm as a club toward off an aggressive grizzly bear, but Marcia, who had driven me to theappointment, broke in with the truth. (I believe I posted this on Facebook atthe time, so forgive me if you already heard it.)Other than to have fun telling you about my little shiningmoments, my point here is to remind us that story, when unexpected, can hitpeople strongly. You can have a lot of fun with story, on the page and off!It’s a gift! Find your balls and give it! Look for opportunities, and thenreport back to us, OK?(For more on this subject, see post 145, Lying is Good for You.)Do you have a story about a time when you fun-lied?

{"title": "Thematic Rule of Two", "date": "Wednesday, August 16, 2017", "text": "Zestful Blog Post #225I like to use twos in writing.If you have a work in progress—fiction, that is—most likelyyou have a theme in there somewhere. Take a little time to think about it andlook for ways to develop it. Does love conquer all? If so, throw in more hateand see if you can shake love’s foundations. Or, perhaps, is lovemeaningless—and noble action the only valuable thing for a human to dedicatehimself to? Ramp up the romance and see if the dispassionate seeker can beswayed.A good technique is to explore more than one theme; thenthey can carom off each other and build complexity. A tough guy with a drinkingproblem is a bit of a cliché; what if you have your addicted detective fightingfor the right to adopt a five-year-old orphaned beauty queen? Whoa, dude, thatis off the wall. It can become a main plot, or a strong subplot. You’ve got aman’s struggle with inner demons, and you’ve got a needy child in limbo. Thisopens up all kinds of possibilities: family, the circle of life, exploitation,vulnerability, love and sacrifice.You can jolt some juice into your work in small ways, too.Instead of simply having two characters disagree, have one throw a chair. Or ifyou already have a fistfight going, make sure somebody ends up withlife-changing injuries, instead of just a black eye. Let your charactersabandon themselves to their fates—and hey, fate is another theme right there.How do your characters think about it, what do they do to try to beat it, cheatit, or meet it?[Rocket and capsule, U.S. Project Gemini. Two guys were in there, all the way up and all the way down. Photo by ES.]  When you feel stuck, sit back and throw out some possibilitiesinvolving twos, or even threes.Oh, my God, they’retwins! That’s how the alibi got past the D.A.!Get out now! It’s notjust a twister, it’s twisters plural, coming from opposite directions!Success in love andachievement both! Wow, what could go wrong now?I betrayed not onlyyou; I betrayed myself as well.We’ll use not onedecoy, but two. It’s foolproof, I tell you!You see how it works. The rule of two is an easy techniqueto visit any time your fiction needs a boost. Have you used the rule of two in writing fiction? Tell usabout it.

{"title": "Mad Scientist's Guide to Fiction", "date": "Thursday, August 10, 2017", "text": "Zestful Blog Post #224This post is a meaty excerpt from my article, \"Fiction Lab,\" in theSeptember 2017 issue of Writer’s Digest magazine.For my 10th birthday, I requested and received a chemistryset. It came with all the cool stuff, but the experiments in the instructionbook were feeble. You knew what was supposed to happen; nothing exploded,nothing grew over the top of the test tube. I started to think outside the kit.I took apart Christmas lights to create dollhouse lamps, but achieved only ablown fuse and some smoke. When my mother got hold of a fetal pig for me todissect, I hooked it up to a dry cell in an attempt to trigger reflex motion. Isucceeded in giving myself a shock.Then a school chum told me he’d learned the recipe forgunpowder. It’s hard to fathom now, but children in the 1960s could and didobtain the raw materials for making explosives. The local pharmacist sold me asmuch potassium nitrate as I wanted, no questions asked, 15 cents an ounce. Fromthere, life got a lot more interesting. (Surprisingly, I emerged from childhoodwith my eyesight, hearing, and all fingers and toes intact.)My young mad-scientist days taught me some basic lessons increativity. Now, as a writer of fiction, I create different sorts ofthings—equally incendiary and no less fun.A mad scientist is passionate about a vision of somethingnew. Perhaps because of that, she might seem somewhat unbalanced (hence mad).She’s eager to try anything to bring about success, and willing to enduresacrifice. A mad scientist’s spirit is indomitable and fearless. Most importantof all, she’s ready to pick up after a failure and try a different formula. Allqualities, as you’ve probably deduced, that would serve a writer just as well.When your daily pages are looking stale, or your ideasaren’t flowing as fast, free and fun as you’d like—step into your fiction laband try these approaches to tap into the mad-scientist spirit. Throw out theinstructions.We’re talking about a mad scientist, not an ignorant one.Textbooks serve a purpose—one must learn at least the rudiments of one’s craftbefore breaking new ground—but they can also become a crutch if we cling tothem too tightly.The poet Ezra Pound encouraged Ernest Hemingway to push beyondhis journalism training to write short vignettes for The Little Review.Hemingway hadn’t written much fiction yet, but he penned a few vignettes ofjust a paragraph or so each, then he wrote more of them. It was bold to producesuch short things and call them finished pieces; nobody else at the time wasreally doing that. But Hemingway wanted to write tight and true, and broughtwar and bullfighting to life with bluntness and cruel beauty in those brief butpowerful portrayals.  Later heinterspersed them with short stories to form his first collection, In Our Time, which brought him fame.Those vignettes that blew readers away in 1925 are no less effective today.In 1980, Jean M. Auel broke new ground with the launch ofher Earth’s Children series (The Clan ofthe Cave Bear, etc.), which endowed her preliterate primitive characterswith emotion and powers of thought equivalent to those we associate with modernhumans. I don’t know where she got the idea, but it sure wasn’t from anyclassroom I’ve ever heard of. Readers are still buying those rule-smashingstories today.The point here is to not be constrained by convention. Ifyou’re moved to try something different but a little voice says, “Wait, that’snot what we learned in the workshop!”—then stop and consider. Sometimes the“No!” and its attendant discomfort are really cues that you need to say, “Yes!”What lies beyond the textbook is your own vision. To bringit into focus, find some stillness. Unplug from all the online crap and letyour mind settle down. Contemplate your writing project, at whatever stage it’sin. Pay attention to any thoughts that come up about it, and write them down,whether they’re ideas about plot, or hunks of story, whatever. Even apparentjunk tends to morph into original material if you stay open and give it enoughtime to move beyond stock advice and become wholly your own.Stock the shelveswith interesting supplies.Of course, to remain perpetually in creation andexperimentation mode, you do have to look beyond your own brain.Dashiell Hammett read widely, seemingly without rhyme orreason: a Shakespeare play after a book on horology after a history of theBalkans after a memoir of a cowboy. This kind of reading was a sort offertilizer for his brain. The MalteseFalcon didn’t have a clockmaking cowboy from Albania in it, but it did havetight time frames, wild action and international quarreling.Consider anything and everything fodder for your fiction.Breakthroughs can happen when you draw information and inspiration fromunlikely sources. Court transcripts, for instance, can yield amazing material.If your romance novel is lagging, why not look up the transcripts from somejuicy, high-profile divorce cases? You won’t necessarily pluck from themword-for-word, but you could come across details that spark novelty.Comb through belongings left over from your childhood.Remember what it was like to sneak around the neighborhood pretending to be asecret agent. Call up your most humiliating memory from the baseball diamond orSunday school.Learn to see possibilities in films, fiction, cereal boxes,weapons catalogs—anything! Throw things together in ways nobody else has daredto try; juxtapose wildly. Drop poison into a sculptor’s clay. Make a planetgrow arms and legs. Impose no restrictions! Tinker to your heart’s content.. . .Make another one.If you quit after one attempt, of course, you wouldn’t bemuch of a scientist—more like a curious visitor. There is tremendous power insetting to work anew, and seeing the next project through to the end. Makeyourself at home in your lab. Construct it to suit your purposes not just for awayward afternoon, but for countless days of discovery and wonder.The world looks to artists to leave the general comfortzone, then report back. If you do that with intention and verve, again andagain, it’s only a matter of time before you’ll look down at a creation andnotice something different, something fabulous.Your heart will race and your blood will pound and you willraise your fists and shout, “It’s alive!”[For now, the whole article is available only in the currentmagazine.]Did you ever blow anything up?

{"title": "The Fun Of It", "date": "Thursday, August 3, 2017", "text": "Zestful Blog Post #223Some years back, in conversation with a flute player, Iasked why she played in the local symphony. We didn’t get paid, yet everybodyfaithfully showed up at rehearsals and concerts. Some players put more effortinto it, others less. This flute player was a committed player with excellentskills. I played percussion.“I just love to play the flute,” she said, smiling, thenrepeated, “I just love to play the flute!” Fair enough. Then she asked, “Why doyou come to symphony?”No one had ever asked me that before. I said, without anyconscious thought, “I come to serve the music.” I think about that from time totime, as I’ve segued into (amazingly) getting paid to play in semiprofessionalensembles. The music must be served; it needs good players to do it.It used to bug the hell out of me when a particular sectionmate would shrug off my attempts to help him play his part right or even comein at the right place. “Hey, I do this to have fun,” he would whine. I'd turn away in disgust and think, People buy tickets to come and hear us play,and they expect to hear and see everybody doing their best. (You lazy asshole.)The worst was, this guy had a degree in music and tutored young percussionists.Fun isn’t whacking the drum carelessly and coming inwhenever you guess is right. That is self-indulgence. Fun is keeping track ofevery measure, then playing the notes exactly as written on the page, withsensitivity, so that your playing melds with everyone else’s playing, as wellas with the conductor’s baton, so that the whole becomes much more than the sumof its parts. That’s satisfaction. That’s fun. You’ll feel like smiling whileyou’re doing it, even silently laughing with pleasure.The analogy with writing is real. A committed writer showsup on the page and puts it out there. You serve the words, you serve thewriting. A quality result is far, far more than the sum of all those sentencesand punctuation marks. And there’s everything right with fun! Having fun is thebest way to do it: when it works, it’s fun, when it sings, it’s fun, when you’rein the zone, in the flow, it’s fun. A commitment to that kind of fun issublime.I might note that anthropologists and linguists believe humansong almost certainly preceded language, which squares with the fact thatpaleolithic flutes predate—by far—the earliest known writing on clay tablets. Asmusic developed, so did speech, writing, and literature. Literary forms gotlonger and more complex, and the novel emerged, arguably between the fourteenthand seventeenth centuries. The corresponding musical form, the symphony, alsoemerged around the end of that period. The Greek word 'symphonia' meansagreement or concord of sound.Part of the gorgeous game of life is being present and makingthe most of every situation. The percussion section of an orchestra doesn’talways have parts to play, as for instance in most violin concertos. (Cymbalsand drums tend to overpower a small solo instrument such as a violin.) So yousit out those pieces. The tradition among professionals is to sit or standquietly and pay attention to what’s going on, first because it’s respectful,second because it’s pleasant to listen and evaluate what everybody’s doing, andthird because you often learn things. And sometimes, fourth, if you’ve moved toa seat in the rehearsal hall well beyond the edge of the stage, you’re asked bythe conductor how the balance is, and you can helpfully report that the Frenchhorns are slightly obliterating the soloist during the coda.I remember being appalled seeing a young percussion playerlistening to pop music on his headphones during a rehearsal featuring a goodregional soloist. He ignored what was happening, live, in front of him, as wellas the example the rest of us were setting.You’re supposed to take advantage of the opportunities thatcome your way, and you’re supposed to understand that something that might notseem like an opportunity just might be one. And that is fun.What do you think? You are heartily invited to post acomment. Just click below where it says, 'No Comments,' or '2 Comments,' orwhatever.

If you’re unfurmiliar, Reddit is where you can post stuff on line.They’re a lot of great stories on Reddit. I guess I couldwrite one. For instants, I remember in junior high when I dawned a Start Trekuniform and lead my pals on a quest. Autumn had came, and we wanted to build abond fire. We dragged over some old wood palettes from the back of the school. Butwhen it came down to brass tax, we didn’t have any matches. My boyfriend, whohad the face of a brauler—he had been in many brauls—decided to steal some froma party store. I was against stealing, exetera, but I chocked it up to hiswanting to blead the system. Plus, I didn’t want to act like a Pre-Madonna.Without further adieu, I hopped on my bike and rode to thepawn shop. I rode so fast I almost ran into a car, which had to slam on itsbreaks. At the shop, I hawked my class ring, which for all intensive purposes Ididn’t need anymore. Not like I was at my boyfriend’s beckon call, but I didwant to tow the line where the law was concerned, so I rode fast with my brannew ten dollars to the party store before he could choplift the matches.However! Low and behold, this girl from marching band wastheir, hanging all over my guy. I saw the whole thing as soon as I stepped footin the store. He saw me, and his face went beat red. The whole bond fire was amute point now.“Well, this is totally out of the blew,” I said. “Where didthis retch come from?” I waited with baited breath to see what he would say.He mumbled something I couldn’t here. I gave him a peace of my mind, then stormed off. Then Iremembered I still had on my Start Trek shirt. I felt like an imbacel.But you know what? The next day he comes over to my housewith a big bokay of flowers. I was like????? He goes, “You’re a shoe-in to bemy date for the prom.” So, he wanted to barry the hatchet.You could knit-pick this story to death, and you probablywill, but I feel like I got it out of my system and am back on an even keal.

Deep water leads to deep trouble—and a lot of grief forLillian if she can’t pull this one out.[Sneak peek.]If you’re interested in joining my Special Team of AdvanceReaders (S.T.A.R.), just shoot me an email (esims at elizabethsims dot com) and say, “Addme!” You’ll get a link to your choice of e-reader file and my sincere thanks.You’ll also get a link for a free copy once the novelette is released, with myrequest for a fair and honest rating or review.

{"title": "Close Listening for Writers", "date": "Thursday, July 13, 2017", "text": "Zestful Blog Post #220                                                                            If you’re a faithful reader of this blog, you’ve seen myposts on ‘close reading’ for improving as a writer. (Posts 163, 171, 177, and203.)  Thanks to my friend Jay, whom someof you met in post 209 a couple of months ago, I’ve been thinking a lot about ‘closelistening,’ and how it can enrich a writer’s life and work.Jay was born with empty sockets instead of eyes, sonaturally much of his interaction with the world is through sound. He’s atalented musician, piano tuner, change ringer (church steeple bells), typewriterrestorer, and composer.   [Here’s Jay with his dog Willow, who leads him on daily walksthat include impromptu cross-country segments. Unlike a trained guide dog whowaits for voice commands, Willow takes charge when they go out. As backup, Jaycarries his collapsible white cane and phone, but has never had to resort to them.Willow always gets everybody home safely—though sometimes muddily. Note super secure leash hold.]We correspond via email and the occasional phonecall. (We live in different states.) Lately we’ve been sharing audio files backand forth, and talking about them.I realize that blind people not only develop more acutehearing than the rest of us; they develop a greater ability to distinguish multiplesounds, or multiple auditory events, at once. A soundscape really does unfoldin layers, or more like a 3-D texture, and they can perceive it so well:A slamming car door isn’t just a slamming car door. It’s eithernearby or farther away. It’s a big car—or maybe, come to think of it, it’s nota door slam after all, but the deeper and more final sound of a trunk slam,like maybe that Cadillac we rode in once. The clarity of the slam indicates thecar’s position near the curb, because if it’s clear, it’s directly out front here.But if it’s muffled slightly, it’s parked a little bit over that way, becausethere’s that thicket of chokecherry in between, which, because it’s October,has lost many of its leaves, but maybe only about fifty percent, as of today. Butif it rains, as it smells like it’s going to, well then a lot more leaves willdrop and blow around and we’ll feel them on the sidewalk tomorrow when we goout. We can pick up a few and explore their structure and texture. Meanwhile,the FedEx truck has driven by, the three young girls who always walk home fromschool together have gone past, and some kind of hawk is making a kill nearbybecause, tiny little squirky death sounds.With just this example, do we begin to understand therichness?Jay talks about “reading” voices to detect their basictemperaments. He talks about timbre, modulation, complexity. He can characterizeany voice, which can be a little unnerving when you realize he’s reading you.I got this from him the other day:“The guy that recently got my attention is Elliot Rodger,who went on that killing spree in California. He left a potload of videos onyoutube and, if I had no idea of who he was, I would say that he sounds like anunimaginative actor trying to do his best with a very poor script. He willstart by describing a scene such as a park that he’s near and he sounds rathercheerful and that’s the best part of the “script.” Then he starts his usualwhine about how, no matter how he spruces himself up, the girls still flock toaverage dudes. A wee trickle of emotion creeps in when, just once, he puts somediaphragm into ‘It’s not fair!’ Otherwise, he has a gentle, tenor voice andeven when he says that this is the ‘day of retribution’ he sounds hollow.”Isn’t all this so goddam magical? I happen to think Jay is anextraordinary person, eyes or no eyes. I’m lucky to know him, and just wantedto share a little bit of our friendship with you. He’s cool with it.Here’s something to try. Think about a scene you’re writing.Momentarily visualize it, then close your eyes and chillax. Consider sounds. Considerlittle bits of the scene one at a time, as they overlap and appear anddisappear, not the scene as a whole. There will be sounds from things visibleand not immediately visible. A jet overhead. Some guy banging with a hammer, tryingto tear out the rusted muffler on his car. Softer sounds mixed with louderones. Someone setting up a tent, someone sorting cards, drawing with a steelpen, gossiping quietly, sighing, laughing nastily, striking a match, makingchange, loading ammo, turning on the air conditioner.What happened?

{"title": "Showing vs Overshowing", "date": "Thursday, July 6, 2017", "text": "Zestful Blog Post #219A comment on my post ‘Extrapolation for Writers’ asked aboutsharing enough versus oversharing—a question of detail. What’s the perfectamount of detail to give your reader? You want enough so that he feels fullyanchored in the scene, yet not too much that he gets bored or restless. (Thanksfor prompting this post, Liz B.)Of course, readers’ tastes and preferences vary, so LeoTolstoy’s War and Peace, with itssurpassing level of detail, is one reader’s heaven, another’s hell. GregoryMcDonald’s Fletch books, with theirpaucity of description (yet fast action and plentiful dialogue), mightrepresent the reverse. So, we are left with subjectivity.I’ve thought and thought about this issue, and have come torealize that to get it right, an author needs experience writing and reading,especially close reading. And while there’s no master formula, I’ve come upwith a couple of guidelines. Stick with me.First, experience. A professional author must read not onlyfor pleasure, but for self-education. That might seem obvious, but I’m always alittle surprised when I’m discussing books with an aspiring author who says, “Oh,I didn’t like that book. Couldn’t get into it. Why? I don’t know why.” Or, “Ijust love all her novels!! Always have. Why? I guess—well, I can’t really say.”  Bear down when you read. Intuition is good, but don’t stopthere. Drill into what makes a passage work or not work. Very often, yourespond to the details of a scene, whether in description or dialogue.(Examples to follow.) There’s no right or wrong here—just what seems right orwrong to you. In this way, close reading helps you get to know your own style.I keep recommending the practice of copying passages of good books, longhand oron the keyboard. I call it ‘Writing with the Masters,’ though I’m not the firstto ever think of it. And keep writing, and keep showing your work to readersyou respect. Listen to what they say.Going, now, beyond those general admonitions, which reallyapply to any aspect of writing, and into the showing of details. I’m a believerin learning from examples, so here are some:Which of the following three do you prefer?:“Consider it a loan, then,” I said. “Let’s be real.”She said OK.“Consider it a loan, then,” I said. “Let’s be real.”She blew a strand of her dyed-red hair out of her eyes and pouredsome brandy into my coffee cup. “All right, then.”“Consider it a loan, then,” I said. “Let’s be real.”She got up and went to the cabinet above the sink on theleft-hand side. She opened the cupboard door with her right hand, took out abottle of brandy with her left, and returned to the table. She took the cap offthe bottle and tipped it so that some brandy ran into my coffee cup. After that,she set the bottle down on the table and sat down. The chairs had blue vinylcoverings. Blowing a strand of her dyed-red hair out of her eyes, she said, “Allright, then.”We agree. Number two, right?The key I’ve used for so long that it’s become almostunconscious, is to give at least one, and rarely more than two details, perchunk of story. The first example above gives zero details. The second givestwo: the dyed-red hair and the pouring of the brandy, which bring that portionof the scene to life. The third gives like a thousand, and the preponderancemakes the passage heavy and boring. (The second passage is from a long short story I’m finishingup, involving Lillian Byrd and some deep trouble…)Furthermore, I’ve found that pace is an important regulatorfor making decisions about detail. If you need to pick up the pace, just showus the punch to the jaw and get on with it. But if things are moving alongnicely, you might have the punchee see the fist coming as if in slow motion,before knuckles contact lower mandible. If the punch is going to be animportant one, and the action has alreadybeen fast, you might wish to decelerate further by having the punchee alsorealize his back is already against the wall, and it’s going to be impossibleto roll with this one—just gonna have to brace for it and keep looking for away out. And then the impact, and you might want to describe the feeling ofthat.So, in sum:Give at least one or two details per chunk of story (and ofcourse you are the one to decide what makes a chunk);When in doubt, limityourself to one or two details per chunk; andPermit pace to help with decisions of detail.And that’s enough for today. Is there anything you’d like toshare about this topic? We’re all keen to learn!Lastly, a note from one of us. Faithful reader and commenterBJ Phillips has a new novel out calledSNOWBIRD SEASON. We think it could appeal to the romantic side of women-lovin' women!If you’d like me to mention your new book, just shoot me anemail with a link.

{"title": "Introvert's Guide to Speaking at Conferences", "date": "Thursday, June 29, 2017", "text": "Zestful Blog Post #218I’ve been meaning to share an article I wrote for Writer’sDigest magazine of March/April (2017), as well as a revealing experience I hadafter speaking at a conference last year.The article is my blueprint for being a successfulconference presenter. The first part covers how to pitch your idea to theorganizers, and then if selected, write a talk illustrated with PowerPointslides. But I’m leaving that off here, because there's advice about that everywhere you look. What I want to share is the second part of the article: the other stuff you don't see anywhere,about what to do, how to act, and essential logistics to help you enjoy a successful,no-stress-added conference. Not that I love conferences; I tend toward introversion,which is why I’ve worked out these protocols to help smooth the way.When you arrive atthe conference, touch base with registration, check for messages, and tryto say hi to the organizers, whom you’ve likely corresponded with but not yet met in person. Drop off your books (if you have a published title youplan to sell or sign onsite) at the bookselling venue, if there is one. It’stypical for authors to bring or ship ahead their own stock, which simplifiesthings for the bookseller. But even if the bookseller has promised to obtainand sell presenters’ books on their own, I try to bring extra stock just incase.Allow lots of extra time to find your assignedsession room, set up and get comfortable. Make sure the room is equippedwith anything you need for your presentation (a laptop, projector, handouts yousent ahead to be printed, etc.). If there’s only a short break between theprior presenter and you, be ready to set up fast. Your room may have a staffmember on hand to facilitate the end of one session and the beginning ofanother. If it doesn’t and the speaker before you runs over time, approach thepodium and say with a smile, “I have to start in X minutes.”Be prepared tointroduce yourself. Few conferences have enough volunteers to provideintros for every session. I include a slide of my relevant credentials at thebeginning.[This is one of the least flattering photos of me talking I could find. Good for my vanity, which according to some, as you'll see, is extreme.]Keep cool ifsomething goes wrong. Power failure, medical emergency, missing property,disputes over seating—I’ve dealt with them all. Attendees will look to you asan authority figure, so if you stay calm, they will too. If a tech issue arises,send for an AV tech immediately; don’t spend more than a minute trying totroubleshoot it yourself. If all fails, be prepared to deliver your talk withjust your script.Unless the room isvery small, use the microphone and speak into it consistently. Tell youraudience, “If at any time you can’t hear me, call out.” It’s easy to drift awayfrom the mic.If you’ve brought asignup sheet for your email list, circulate it right away. I hand around asmall paper shopping bag and ask people to throw in their card or a scrap ofpaper with their email address; I tell them they’re signing up for mynewschats, and a chance to win this!(One of my books, personalized to them.) At the end of my talk I find the bag,draw a name and ask that person to meet me as soon as I’ve gathered my stuff.Abide by your timelimit. If you have a room monitor, ask that person to signal you when youhave 10 minutes to go. Otherwise, keep an eye on your watch. Be prepared toskip material at the end if need be. Don’t talk faster to cram in your lastbits of material. If you’ve built in time for a Q&A, you have some wiggleroom.Be sure to thank theorganizers and volunteers at the beginning and/or end of your talk.Clear out quicklywhen you’re done. Sometimes attendees will come up and want to talk; tellthem you can chat in the concourse once you collect your things.When “off duty” atthe conference, remember that you might be recognized and approached forconversation. Smile and try to be generous with your time. It may soundobvious, but avoid gossip and vulgarity—which includes getting too drunk in thebar after dinner.There is a lot ofwork involved with being a successful conference presenter. But if you do itwell, you’ll achieve the dual goals of giving valuable information to youraudience and piquing their interest in you and your work—beyond the podium.That’s the end of the article. But some conferences extendyour experience by sending you audience feedback weeks later, which can be helpful,delightful, affirming, depressing, and soul-crushing. I can never really cometo terms with the diametrically opposed feedback I’ve gotten.Here are exact quotes from feedback from one session Igave last fall. These people were in the same room as I, all together. Same time-spacecontinuum.“Excellent presentation, very informative and fun.”“It was as if someone else had prepared the slide deck forher and she didn’t know what was coming next.”“She dealt very well with the interruption of PurseGate 2016.”“Perhaps interruptions rattled her but she never got overit.”“Delivers a lot of information in a manner that is superpersonal and therefore we feel like intimates of hers, fun and comfortable.”“Big commercial ego trip.”“Great, could listen to her for longer, very good.”My very favorite: “She knows her stuff but seemed to be ondrugs or something.”If only.What do you think?

{"title": "The Magic of Reverse Outlining", "date": "Thursday, June 22, 2017", "text": "Zestful Blog Post #217Before the magic happens, a couple of bits of business. Ipromised last week to reveal the name of the restaurant in the photo if nobody guessed. Not likeit’s some super amazing thing, but it’s the 13 Coins next to the Seattle-Tacomaairport. It’s Marcia’s and my favorite place to eat when we stay near thatairport, in spite of the slight hokiness of the coins being embedded in thepolymer coating on the tabletops. We love the midcentury-modern ambience, andthe food is good, although I watched the bartender water our Manhattans once. Icomplained, but the server argued that that was impossible. I let it go, butlater saw the server whispering to the bartender, who avoided looking at us forthe rest of the time. Don’t let that stop you from going there, though; justorder wine or beer. Or coffee, if it’s breakfast time. We’re not degenerateshere.If you are reading this blog between the dates of June 22and June 26, 2017, I wish you would pop over to Amazon and snag a free Kindlecopy of I am Calico Jones. It’sa collection of four short stories by yours truly, led off by the titlestory, which is a personal account of an adventure by the very Calico Jones aboutwhom Lillian Byrd loves to read in the cheesy novels she gobbles up at everyopportunity. And wow, when I just tested that link, I see that it's at #4 in LGBT short reads, edging out the tons of erotica that make up most of that list. Go, literature.Not long ago during a conversation with one of the fewprivate clients I work with on writing fiction, I gave an impromptu piece ofadvice she found very helpful. She mentioned it in a comment a few weeks ago, and now I’m motivated to share it in this post today. (Thanks, Bev.)It has to do with the revision process. Now, this can be duringchapter-by-chapter revisions as you go, or while you’re revising a manuscriptthat is more or less complete.[It wasn’t easy to come up with aphoto for this post. Can you find reverse in this image? It’s my car; theplastic of the gearshift cover is delaminating, but it is 22 years old, sogimme a break.]The technique very simply is this: Write down a littlesummary of each chapter. OK, that’s it. Now, most of us like to do at least alittle bit of outlining in advance of writing fiction, and that is a good thing.But as we write, things don’t always go as planned, and that may be all veryfine too. But then what?Writing a little summary of each chapter does severalthings:·      It helps you keep track of your threads of plotand theme as you go, and it helps you distinguish the two.·      It helps you spot problems that need fixing,like plausibility gaps or plot gaps, or simply unfinished thoughts that requirefurther development. It also will help you spot redundancies or nonessentialmaterial that should be cut.·      If you listen to your gut as you review thissummary, you’ll also notice where and how your emotions are triggered, and then you can work to emphasize or deemphasizeappropriately.·      It builds an accurate working outline. Thisalone makes this tip worth his weight in gold, if you ask me. (How much does itweigh? That’s the key question. I believe at least a pound. My mailing address? Just ask.)·      This working outline will eventually become yourcompleted outline, which you will use when pitching your manuscript to agentsand/or publishers.·      If you self publish, your outline or summarywill be helpful to you when writing promo and cover copy for your book.When I practice this, I write my summaries on a yellow pad off tothe side as I’m working on the digital manuscript on my computer. Just a fewsentences are all you need.Have you ever done this? If so, tell us how it works foryou. If not, and you decide to try it, ditto!What do you think?

{"title": "Extrapolation for Writers", "date": "Thursday, June 15, 2017", "text": "Zestful Blog Post #216If you’re still with me after reading the title of this post,congratulations and thank you. I appreciate that there are so many serious writerswho follow these posts. What you get here, and here alone, is my perspective onhow to write well, how to avoid crappy mistakes, and how to arrange one’s lifeas a writer.Back in the 1980s I worked in the human resources departmentof a large financial institution. One of our tasks was training bankers on howto sell bank products—checking accounts, credit cards—to retail customers. Myboss bought an up-to-the-minute sales training program on video and we decidedto try it out on our bankers.The videos followed a salesman with a product called atransporter, which (oddly) looked like an ordinary microwave oven, but wassupposed to transport whatever you put in it from one place to another, as ifby magic. Obviously this was a dummy product; the product itself was unimportant;the point of the video was to demonstrate effective, customer-oriented salestechniques.The salesman in the video demonstrated all the right stuff: questionedhis customers as to their needs, discussed characteristics of the transporter, elicitedobjections, overcame objections with further discussion and questioning. In theend, the customer agrees to buy a transporter. I thought the videos were funand effective. To those of us in HR, it was an easy jump to think of ways touse those sales techniques to sell all the different sorts of bank products thecompany offered.But the first time we showed the video to a group offront-office employees, they sat there impassively through the whole thing. Whenit was over there was silence, until one guy finally said, “But we’re notselling transporters.” These front-office bank folks were utterly baffled as towhy we would show them a video on how to sell transporters. They were incapableof extrapolating from the video to their own frame of reference. (And that wasthe end of the transporter videos.)Understand that there are millions of peoplejust like those bankers. And they read books. Most writers have an intuitive feelfor extrapolation, but I think it’s worthwhile to talk about explicitly. Theword extrapolation is not the precise right one here, because it means toextend an application of something. If there was a word that combined extrapolationwith adaptation, then I think we would have it, but it seems that even thevast, agile language of English has its limitations.For writers, extrapolation means looking past the literal.It means making leaps of imagination. You cannot trust your reader to do it. Thereader craves the experience of youdoing it. And I believe the most important element in this is to give yourselfpermission to do it.Here’s what I’m talking about. You come across a suggested writingprompt somewhere, like, “A disgraced celebrity flees high society.” You couldcome up with something rather literal, like a Park Avenue heiress gets bustedfor heroin and goes to the Betty Ford Center. Perhaps there she meets a humblelaborer who will introduce her to a life of honesty and simplicity. Or perhapsto a life of exciting dirt bike racing. Or not. You could venture further and makethat character a track star who gets caught filing his spikes or something, andhe’s suspended from the sport. What might happen next? Maybe he coaches ajunior team for a while, and learns from the kids the true meaning of integrity.You could invent a charismatic faith healer who is exposed as a phony, and whodecides to exile herself for a while, and goes on a quest to test herself andto make atonement. Those are skeletons of whole stories right there.[Extra credit if you can name this restaurant, located near the shade of many large evergreen trees.]You might observe someone across the room in a café whopiques your interest. Don’t stop there. Maybe that person is watching anotherperson. You then observe the third person. What’s going on? You decide. Who arethose people? Pay attention. What are they wearing, do they seem happy or sador something else? Maybe you can’t say why a person piques your interest.(Beyond, OK, pheromones.) That right there is reason to study that person more,and delve into your own feelings and reactions. When uncertain emotions come up,pay lots and lots of attention, and give yourself lots and lots of permissionto extrapolate, generalize, adapt, and individualize.Speaking of individualization, I once read in a manuscript, He went ballistic. Nothing more. Well,hell, don’t tell us he went ballistic. The bankers won’t know what’s going on. Tellus:He grabbed Mike by thehead and threw him to the floor, then slammed a chair into the model of the newbuilding, smashing it to pieces. The second chair went through the window,followed by the poly-acrylic achievement award and everything else on Mike’s desk.I hope I’ve given you another angle of insight into how tomine and refine your raw material.

{"title": "Dynamic Plot & Theme Demo", "date": "Thursday, June 1, 2017", "text": "Zestful Blog Post #214Authors often get confused by the subjects of plot versus theme,and I don’t just mean aspiring authors. I’ve seen established authors getthings mixed up, and their fiction turns out much less powerful than it couldbe.Here’s how to make magic: Consider a plot thread and a themetogether. Here is an example, oractually, I guess it’s a demonstration.Recently I set out to write a short story starring my alterego, Lillian Byrd. I wanted to give Lillian a problem to solve. And I wantedthe problem to involve a friend of hers, and I selected her animal lovingfriend, Billie. Billie calls Lillian and tells her that her car has been towedand impounded by the city, and she doesn’t have enough money to get it out ofjail. So, problem.Lillian offers to lend her money, but Billie doesn’t want toborrow. She asks instead for Lillian to come over and help her sort through hercollection of vinyl records so that some can be sold to raise the money for thefines. Because Billie’s record collection is the stuff of legend, Lillian can’tabide the thought of it being dismantled. OK, so this situation is getting morecomplex, and it becomes a plot arc. One way or another, we know that Billie’sproblem will be solved by the end of the story, because that’s how stories work.And there we have a theme, and we can call that theme any ofa number of things: friends helping friends, the quality of friendship, theplight of low-wage workers, the hazards of not saving money for emergencysituations.Very soon after creating this problem for Lillian, Irealized I needed more plot, and it stood to reason that another plot linewould be just the thing. Lillian must take it upon herself to solve thisproblem of Billie’s, but she’s not sure what to do. The second plot thread appearswhen Lillian’s phone rings, and it’s her rich friend Flora Pomeroy, who wantsher to drop everything and come out for a boat ride with her and some otherrich friends. Billie urges her to go (they can deal with the record collection later),and we know that the boat ride will furnish some delectable action.As soon as Lillian gets aboard, Flora tells her that she wantsher to investigate a member of the boating party — while they’re out on thewater! — in order to settle a bet Flora made with another friend, who alsohappens to be aboard. As soon as we hear about a bet, we know cash is lurkingaround.What develops is another theme, along with the plot line,along with a significant plot arc. We could call it the theme of friendshelping friends, just the same as above, or we could call this theme humaningenuity, or we could individualize the theme and call it Lillian’swillingness to take drastic risks for the hell of it. (That theme seems to cropup repeatedly in my Lillian fiction.)You can see that both plot lines and both themes will cometogether and make for a satisfying outcome. At least, that is what I’m hopingreaders will think after they’ve read the story! It is as yet unpublished,because I have to create an e-cover for it and run it by my beta readers. [Wouldyou like to become one of my beta readers? Send me an email—addy is on my website under contact—telling me so. You’ll also become a member of my Newschat list, if you’renot on it already.]So, what’s the point of considering plot in light of theme?Simply that when you consider your plot lines along with the themes that relateto them, you create an awareness in yourself, an energy that makes your storyadd up to more than the sum of its parts.

{"title": "Three Kinds of Writers", "date": "Thursday, May 25, 2017", "text": "Zestful Blog Post #213There are three kinds of writers. The first kind of writeris one who does not know the difference between hay and straw, and doesn’t care.The second kind of writer is one who does not know the difference between hayand straw, but when corrected, is glad, and will use the words properlyfrom now on. The third kind of writer knows the difference between hay andstraw. The same goes for concrete versus cement, and iron versus steel. I amthe third kind of writer, and five minutes from now you will be the third kindof writer too. This post is about our material world.Hay versus straw.Hay is fodder for animals, and is made of dried plantsbundled into bales. You may have heard the terms timothy hay, clover hay, andso on. Dried alfalfa is hay. Certain kinds of legumes are grown for hay.Farmers grow hay crops such as these to be cut, then left to dry, then baled.  So yeah, if the field is cut and dried, it’s finished,settled. (In olden times before farm mechanization, farmers would simply scythedown meadow grass, or any kind of undifferentiated growth, let it dry, thenstack it for animal fodder.) Modern hay bales are either square or rectangular,and they separate into segments called flakes. A flake can be an easy way tomeasure how much hay you’re giving to your animals. Also, you’ve seen hay in roundbales, you know, those huge picturesque rolls that dot the fields. Some city dadstell their kids those are cow cocoons: The mama cow lays her egg, then buildsthat large roll of hay around the egg, so that when the calf hatches, it hassomething good to eat right away. It then can eat its way out and be all niceand healthy when it comes into the world.Straw is what is left over from the harvesting of grains:the dried stalks of crops like wheat and oats. Straw is used as beddingmaterial for animals, and decorative bales of straw are sold in hardware storesaround Halloween time. That hayride you went on when you were a kid at somefarm? It was most likely straw you were sitting on, there in the wagon.If you have ever lifted a bale of hay, and then lifted abale of straw, you will immediately understand the difference in food value. Abale that weighs 60 pounds if made of hay would weigh, if it was made of straw,maybe only 10 pounds.So: a horse in a stable eats hay while standing on straw.Cement versusconcrete.Cement is a substance that sticks things together. Concrete is made of cement, aggregate, and water. Cement for use in concrete is made mostly of finely ground limestone. It's a powder. If youwet it, it’s slick to the touch, and sticky. Aggregate, in this sense, is a mixof stones and pebbles and perhaps sand. You mix cement with aggregate andwater, and you stir it around, and you pour it someplace, and when it hardensyou have concrete.The sidewalks you walk upon are not cement, they are concrete.Pilings and abutments that hold up modern bridges are made of reinforcedconcrete. Even though people call them cement mixers, they are concrete mixers. Nothing is made entirely of cement.Bonus: the concrete you walk on can also be called pavement.And it can even be pretty.Iron versus steel.Iron is an element, chemical symbol Fe. You have heard offerrous metals; a ferrous metal is a metal that contains iron. Steel is analloy that is made from iron and other elements, such as carbon and manganese. Itis a ferrous metal.Bonus:This morning you may have fried your eggs in a cast ironskillet. That skillet came out of a mold: it was cast in iron. The railing youlean on when you watch the Mardi Gras parade from your French quarter apartmentis made of wrought iron, which is ductile and malleable, perfect for a blacksmithto make curlicues and slender railings from.You are now officially the third kind of writer.

{"title": "The Murderer at the Next Pump", "date": "Thursday, May 18, 2017", "text": "Zestful Blog Post #212The other day while shopping at the drugstore anothercustomer passed by me, and he gave me the deep creeps. Instead of avoiding eyecontact or turning away as I usually do, I took a better look. He seemed not tohave taken particular notice of me; it was just the vibe. This guy’s aura wasdark and flat.He was an older guy, stubble, carelessly turned out for theday. Often when I see guys like that I figure them for alcoholics or maybe pornaddicts—you know, more pathetic than dangerous. But this one had a dense stareand just this opaque malevolence about him, a hatefulness.And I was reminded of the fact that many crimes, manymurders, go unsolved, and murderers walk among us. Murderers buy groceries andgas up their cars and go to work and the movies. (I keep baby wipes in my car’sconsole, for cleaning my hands after gassing up, specifically because I don’twant murderer molecules to stay on me. You laugh. But you’ll be lookin’ at yourhand different now, when you put that nozzle back, won’t you, my pet? Yes,you will.) No doubt most of us have come into contact with murderers withoutknowing it. Sometimes we get closer than that.Marcia’s cousin was murdered, the crime and subsequentcover-up arranged by the cousin’s estranged husband. (Everybody got nailed, butit took a lot of time.) One of my brother’s buddies played pickup basketball inthe late 1960s with John Norman Collins, who was soon apprehended for thetorture killing of at least six young women and girls. A co-worker of mine hada college roommate who went missing on her way to class and was never found. Theyboth routinely hitched rides to campus… 1970s…A guy who played the trumpet in my marching band at collegeturned out to have murdered his mother and girlfriend by running them over(separately) with his car. I remember that guy as being weedy and odd,turning out for practice in dress pants and black leather street shoes, whilethe rest of us ran around in jeans and sneakers. I could easily have suspectedhim of obsessively collecting bottle caps, but not killing anybody. Cannotremember his name, or would have Googled him for any recent info.You may have similar stories. David Buss wrote a fascinatingbook on the subject,  'The Murderer Next Door'. The point is, human life isso profoundly layered. My purpose today is to remind us writers, especially us littleliberal arts majors who have never been arrested, let alone shared a cell withconvicted felons (for instance), to be open to the vibes that swirl around us. Wetend to forget, and maybe even deny, human evil. It’s not just in TV shows andtrue-crime books. Our observations inform our work. Good, evil, see it all andfeel it all.

{"title": "Five Quickies", "date": "Thursday, May 11, 2017", "text": "Zestful Blog Post #211Writing in the BasinI’d never heard of the Permian Basin Writers Workshop before they asked me to come and be on their faculty this year, but havingminored in geology, I actually knew what the Permian Basin is, so I was like,sure. The event will be in Midland, Texas from September 15 through the 17th.I’ll be doing my workshop called “How to Write a Dynamite Mystery or Thriller ThatSELLS” on Saturday the 16th. Coincidentally, fellow Writer’s Digest personality Chuck Sambuchino will be doing a boot camp there on the 15th.Anyway, if you live in the general area of West Texas, or even if you live in someplacelike Stuttgart, consider joining us for a non-grueling, lively series ofpresentations. I’ll be doing my longer version of that workshop, over twosessions instead of one, and participants will be able to do a bit of real livewriting to test out my ideas — and theirs. Productivity! Yes. Gonna wear mycustom cowboy boots, made many years ago in the nearby town of San Angelo. (’nothercoincidence.)[I designed them, too, with my initials done the same way asI sign them. Boots by Rusty Franklin Boot Co. These are peewees, but he made astandard pair for me too, black and cream in color. This is not my first rodeo.Photo by ES.]Update re: ZB 210Remember the Cuban restaurant I wrote about last week?Marcia and I decided to go there for dinner that night, only to find itclosed. A staff member at the other location said the closure waspermanent.A Nasty ProblemBut speaking of restaurants and visibility, I’m reminded of howdueling signage nearly ruined the business of a Chinese restaurant in a smalltown Marcia and I used to live in. When we were new there, we drove around tofamiliarize ourselves. We stopped at a light and noticed a restaurant and itslarge sign that said, nasty chineserestaurant. Why on earth would someone call their restaurant that?, wewondered. Let’s not eat there. Some days later, I was walking along that samestreet. I looked at the restaurant from a different angle, and saw that itsname was really dynasty chineserestaurant. A traffic sign obscured the first part of their sign whenviewed from directly across the street. Now, the sign didn’t really almost ruintheir business, but it did have an odd impact. You gotta love language.p.s. re: JayI was gratified that so many folks enjoyed the recent postabout my friend Jay, his typewriter business, and his budding interest inphotography (Zestful Blog post 209, “A Blind Man Sees It”). I just wanted toadd one more thing about Jay: always smiling, always enjoying the moment — andbeing fully present.Say it LoudI’m dictating this post using Dragon Naturally Speakingsoftware, premium version 13. After a friend alerted me to a post by Scott Baker about Dragon on MarkDawson’s blog, I decided to give it another try. I had purchased andused the software a few years ago in advance of shoulder surgery, when I fearedI’d be unable to write or type for a while. I didn’t take to it very well, so Idid not continue with it after that. However, I’ve been having a lot of troublehandling all my projects and responsibilities and obligations. So I got hold ofa newer version of Dragon and gave it a go, with more commitment this time, andI’m happy to report that it’s working pretty well. I use an inexpensive usb headset as recommended. I did have to correct Dragonon Chuck Sambuchino’s name, which came out “checks and Chino.” But barely aweek after starting back using Dragon again, its accuracy is pretty good; Chuck’sname was one of only a few corrections I’ve had to make so far, and the onlyserious one. The first time I tried to dictate 1,000 words of original story,it took me three hours, what with having to make corrections as well as relearnthe commands for dictation and navigation. But after just twomore sessions, I dictated 1,000 words in an hour. I would imagine I canincrease that to 2,000 without a whole lot of trouble. (And possibly much higher,given that a normal speaking pace is about 130 words per minute. 130 x 60 = 7,800.)The key is having what you want to say in mind, and then letting it flowwithout worrying very much. And don't be daunted by how much you don't know about it. If you just get the thing and follow the directions, you'll be fine. I’ll keep you posted on how it goes for me. Plus I canslouch in my comfy chair and work at the same time. Sip champagne and have my nails done.What do you think?

{"title": "The Pounding Power of Publicity", "date": "Thursday, May 4, 2017", "text": "Zestful Blog Post #210A few years ago, a neighborhood friend invited me to lunch at a tinyCuban restaurant nearby. The food was fabulous, and reasonably priced too. Theplace could have done with a good scrubbing, but no matter: Every table wasfull and customers were waiting to get in. My friend introduced me to theowner, who talked about how incredibly busy he’d been, ever since a ‘guy’ witha popular TV show did a segment on his place.I learned that before the ‘guy,’ business had been terrible.The owner opened a second location across town with hopes of improving his cashflow. But that failed, and he was facing having to close the original locationtoo. His staff and friends got together and convinced the TV guy to check thisplace out. Guy came, he saw, he ate.The morning after the show aired, the owner decided he’d betterget to the restaurant extra early to do more prep work in case it got busy whenhe opened. When he arrived, a long line of customers had already formed, andthe restaurant wasn’t going to open for two hours yet. And ever since then, theplace had been super busy, and this was a couple of years down the line. GreatCuban dishes, great staff.But then the owner got slapped with a health code violation.Roaches and dirt, yeah. It seems he didn’t take it very seriously. The nextinspection, he got closed down. Customers mourned. According to my sources, theowner refused to do what the health department required, so they kept him closed.Then, sadly, the owner died unexpectedly.The owner of another Cuban restaurant in town bought theplace, cleaned it out (he told me it took his team two weeks to do a thoroughjob), renovated it, and opened under his own name. The food is just asmarvelous. But guess what? Hardly anybody goes there. You can always get a (niceclean) table.The pounding power of publicity. A very simple lesson foranybody who wants to sell anything. Followed by a very simple lesson in common sense:Mop up or else.What do you think?

{"title": "A Blind Man Sees It", "date": "Thursday, April 27, 2017", "text": "Zestful Blog Post #209A friend of mine blew my mind the other day, and I want tosee if yours gets similarly blown.Back when Marcia and I lived in California, we sold ourcondo in the East Bay en route to moving north to the woods of Washington. Wewere fretting over an imperfection in the kitchen floor when our real estateagent said dismissively, “It would take a blind man to see it!” We felt better,and that funny locution entered our lexicon.After we got settled in our little house in the big woods, Ihappened to make friends with a guy who is a super talented trombonist (regionalsymphonic soloist level), a piano tuner, and a typewriter repair specialist.His name is Jay, and he was born without eyes. Here’s how Jay figures it: Evidently,the Depression hit God as well and he hadn’t the wherewithal to update hissupply. So, he asked my soul if it would be okay if he gave me good hearing,curiosity, and a love of the ridiculous. My soul must have agreed, so here I am.Actually, SHE probably made that bargain. A HE would simply have said, “ahwell, get over it.” Only Jay can make you laugh talking about being without eyeballs.He wears cool sunglasses.From his youngest days, Jay figured out work-arounds to do whathe wanted. For instance, after he learned to ride a two-wheeler(!), he masterednavigating his neighborhood by echolocation. He got an education, worked realjobs, fell in love, married, the whole deal. I knew his lovely wife, who, sadly,is no longer with us.Some time in the aughts, Jay and I played Leroy Anderson’ssymphonic novelty piece “The Typewriter” as a duet in the local symphony,using two typewriters from his extensive collection. That’s a story in itself,but I’m trying to stay on track here. Now he lives in Georgia and I live inFlorida. He’s still playing the trombone, and he’s also gotten into changeringing (coordinated bell-tower team music). He’s still fixing andreconditioning typewriters, using his senses of touch, hearing, and—yes, I’vewitnessed it—even smell.I got in touch with him recently to ask about a typewriterfor another performance of the Anderson piece, coming up next concert seasonfor the South Shore Symphony Orchestra (Tampa Bay area) with yours trulyas soloist. He said he had a machine for me, a 1926 Underwood 4 thatshould sound great. He sent me this photo:[Photo by Jay Williams]As a side note, he told me he’s exploring the possibility ofbecoming a photographer. [Mind blown.] He snapped the picture with a digitalcamera, figured out how to transfer the file to his computer, and sent it to meas an email attachment. He said his stepson is a professional photographer who giftedhim with the camera. He knows the photo is blurry, and realized he needs tohold the camera steadier. Having worked as a news photographer, I gave him a coupleof tips on that. Next he sent this photo, of another, recently acquired,machine, a Yost #1 from 1887:[Photo by Jay Williams]Jay intends to make more photographs, and he and his son arethinking they could put together a gallery of the pictures. I thought about it,and I’m like, my God, yeah. A sightless person faces something he’s interactingwith, using his other senses, and captures an image he’ll never experience. Theimage will be something other than ‘what it’s supposed to be.’ But it will besomething. I can’t describe how profoundly that first photo struck me. Layerupon layer of implications. I learned on line that blind photography is a thing—atleast there are a few people doing it. Some of them are partially sighted, andsome of them have their images manipulated by sighted people.Jay, I know you’ll read this (because, software). If you dogo forward with photography, I hope you’ll also write about the images youmake: the things you were sensing and feeling at the moment of the snap. Wouldn't that be cool?What is in this story for writers, artists, creative peopleof all sorts? Simply that there are no limits. Never say, “Yeah, yeah, but,” again.No need to.

{"title": "Errata Be Mine", "date": "Thursday, April 20, 2017", "text": "Zestful Blog Post #208You’ve heard it before: “Don’t edit while you’re writing!”Fine. But for best results, you have to take it to the absolute extreme, whichis, “Even if you know right now that you’regoing to cut the sentence or section you’re writing, finish it.” Finish thethought, finish the little train, don’t stop now, keep going. [If you're in a hurry you can quitreading here, because now I’m just going to throw down acouple of somewhat relevant memories plus a photo.]One has to be of an age to remember writing school assignments like book reports and essays longhand (using an “ink pen” (meaning a ballpoint)). Writing exams longhand is still done, I understand. Invariably, the teacher would say in advance, “If you make a mistake, don’tscribble it out, just cross through it with a single line.” Didn’t you hate that? The whole goddam point ofcrossing out was to hide something stupid you wrote. Because obviously theteacher would read the mistake through the cross-out before going on. Not onlywould that interrupt the flow, but the teacher would see that you started towrite “government” as “goverm—” before noticing it. I never obeyed thesingle-strike-through rule; always scribbled the black hell out of a mistake soit couldn’t be read.[\"Typewriter Eraser, Scale X\" by Claes Odenburg and Coosje van Bruggen, in the sculpture park at the National Gallery of Art. Photo by ES.]This carried over to typewriting as well. The teacher wouldsee that you typed “gpvernment” at first. I spent extra on Eaton’s CorrasableBond paper, which had a coating on it that allowed you to erase mistakes easierthan scratching them out on ordinary paper.These days it’s lovely how easy it is to digitally backspace, delete,cut and “paste” (how quaint that word!). Nobody need see your self-catchable errors, yourchanges of mind, your process.But flow is king (or CEO, or top witch in the coven,whatever). Never lose sight of that. The best way to foster flow is keep goingright on through anything weak. Let it out, let it lie for now, keep movingforward. This bears repeating now and then.

{"title": "Magic Cure for Synopsis Paralysis", "date": "Thursday, April 6, 2017", "text": "Zestful Blog Post #206Everybody hates to write synopses. Your novel is finished,and now you want to shop it around, and you need a synopsis. Or you’ve writtenyour seventh, but your editor requires a detailed synopsis every time, beforethey sign the contract. Or they require a synopsis before you even write thething! You need a synopsis.And synopses suck to write, they just do. I’ve critiquedsynopses for clients, I’ve written my own, and the whole business of distillingyour story to something that sounds fabulous is onerous and upsetting. You haveto leave out so much, and whatever you put in is incomplete, so how do youdecide, rrrrgh, rrrrgh, sucking, sucking. I’m not talking about aparagraph-long piece of cover copy, though those suck to write as well; I’mtalking about the extended, multi-page synopsis you need to satisfy agents andespecially editors. Gosh—this just occurred to me: A fabulous side benefit ofself-publishing is that you don’t have to write synopses. But if you’re after atrad-pub deal, you gotta do ’em.OK, I promised a magic cure, and here it is.Don’t write your synopsis. Talk it.That’s it, basically. Walk away from pen and paper, walkaway from the keyboard. Get cozy with a voice recorder and start telling yourstory to it. Ideally, use a voice-to-text application and be in a privatesetting where you can’t feel inhibited about being overheard. Speak as if you’retelling a friend the story from the start. Don’t worry if you feel awkward/stupid,and have to start and stop. Keep at it, and things will go smoother. If youwere talking to a (patient, interested) friend, you’d tell what happens, andyou’d also talk about the story’s themes— “OK, and there’s this rebirth imagerythat keeps cropping up, like when…” You might talk a little about the germ ofthe story, the seed that made you think, hey, I could write a novel about this!And you’d talk about the characters, both generally and specifically. You’dtalk a bit about the settings, perhaps. You might repeat yourself, you mightthink of something out of order— “Oh! And yeah, the guy’s brother used to be onthe bomb squad, so he’s got like this inside dope on how those robots work…”Natter on. If you do this, and do it naturally and in a relaxed way, you willnot be gripping your head in frustration.Then when you feel like you’ve pretty much got it covered, stopand transcribe it or print it out. NOW you’ve got something to work with! Letit sit for a day or two, then get it out and start editing. You’ll immediatelysee what sounds good and what doesn’t, which parts are more important, whichones less. You’ll cut redundancies, you’ll cut extraneous words, you’ll tightenthings up with conjunctions that flow instead of stumble. Your text willalready be in an informal, vocal cadence, and that’s good for a synopsis, whichought to sound fun, chatty, and quick. You’ll notice good turns of phrase, andpoor ones. You’ll tighten things up more. You’ll have a synopsis.This technique isn’t really magic (I confess), but it canhelp magic happen! I’ve tested it on my own material. If you try it, let meknow how it goes.[photo and photo manipulation by ES]What do you think?

{"title": "The Shifting Winds of Success", "date": "Thursday, March 30, 2017", "text": "Zestful Blog Post #205Jessica Strawser, Editor in Chief at Writer’s Digestmagazine, is now a published author. Almost Missed You is available everywhere, reviews are glowing, and Jessicais officially a success! Congratulations, my friend.In her recent essay in Publisher’s Weekly (whichcoincided exactly with the launch of her book, which I might note is some awesome promo/coordination), Jessica tells a little bit about the challengesand setbacks she dealt with before her publishing contract came. Given that Iknow a little more about her behind-the-scenes struggles, I particularly appreciatethe Nancy Kerrigan-style “Why?” moment.I could not but be struck by the difference between Jessica’sdebut with St. Martin’s Press and mine (St. Martin’s Minotaur) back in 2008. Mybook, The Actress, was in the firstgroup of releases to be issued as e-books (along with print) by SMP. Printedgalleys were sent to the usual print sources, and they generated a handful ofreviews. Authors were informed, just prior to their pub dates, that SMP was nowgoing exclusively to Twitter for promo. No other information or instructionscame forth, other than “Let’s all tweet!” I didn’t have a Twitter account. Igot one, and stumblingly started to use it, in spite of being appalled at the quickshallowness of the medium. I still use it stumblingly. I’m still appalled byit.I was invited to blog for a week on Minotaur’s “Moments inCrime” blog, which I dutifully and as entertainingly as possible did. The blogwent defunct a short time later and was taken down. I repurposed some of thoseposts here in Zestful Writing.Digital profiles and social media were just getting rollingback then, and I was slightly with it, having a web site, but that wasn’tsaying a lot. Downloadable digital audio books—as opposed to books on cassettetape or CD—were starting to gain traction, thanks to the iPod. (RememberiPods?) But it didn’t occur to Minotaur to put The Actress on audio.By contrast, AlmostMissed You came out perfectly: simultaneous print, digital, and audioeditions, with appropriate advance copies to critics AND consumers. Just three daysafter launch, the book has hundreds of positive reviews on Goodreads and dozenson Amazon, thanks in part to NetGalley. (Goodreads and NetGalley were barely gettinggoing back in 2008, and New York publishers were oblivious.) Needless to say,the fact that so many of the reviews are positive has nothing to do with the medium,and everything to do with Jessica’s talent and command of her craft as awriter.Jessica’s position at Writer’s Digest has been a greatplatform. She’s made good use of it; she’s worked. She’s written thenext book, and she’s built a terrific presence on social media, and she’s doneplain old networking as well.As you can see, my purpose with this post is not only togive some exposure and props to Jessica and her book, but to illustrate thespeed of change in the business. I’m happy and excited for my friend, and I’menvious too! But I’ve learned how fickle the world of publishing is, and howmuch one must rely on oneself as a source of strength, creativity, andresilience. The target is always moving. And we’re always learning. Opportunity awaits.What do you think?

{"title": "Other Cool People", "date": "Thursday, March 23, 2017", "text": "Zestful Blog Post #204When On Location,my third Rita Farmer novel, came out, I was invited to participate in a localbook festival. As it happened, an author buddy of mine was there too, and weagreed to have dinner together after the main booksigning event. A FairlyFamous Author was on hand as well, and we all mingled and visited duringautograph evening.Come time to get organized for dinner, my friend and I approachedthe FFA and invited him to join us. Scanning the room beyond us and lookinguncomfortable, he said, “Uh, I think I’m gonna eat with some—other cool people.”We got the translation: “I don’t have firm plans yet. I justbarely caught myself and inserted the word ‘other’ in front of ‘cool people’ inorder to mask what I really mean, which is, I’m going to eat with some coolpeople as yet to be determined by me. You are not those people. I’ll give youthe half-assed courtesy of implying you are cool. But, clearly, you, Elizabethand X, are not cool.”[The coolest photo I could find in my files: cool people photographing a large cool object. It was indeed a cool day.]So, fine. We invited another couple of people to join us, onean author, the other a writing coach. The four of us had a riot getting to knowone another, talking and eating (and yeah, drinking) late into the night. Wediscussed writing, books, and our careers with frankness and warmth. By the endof the night, we were all friends. As it turned out, we were Cool People. We wereeven Nice People: We didn’t even bother to give the ceremonial finger to theFFA.Three takeaways here:One: Writing can be lonely, and we can dwell in our heads tothe detriment of our hearts and sanity, therefore it’s important to get out ofthe house and hang with your fellow sufferers. Suddenly a stunning thinghappens: Nobody’s suffering!Two: When declining an invitation—especially when you can’thonestly say you already have plans—simply say, “I’m sorry, I can’t. Thanks,though.” How hard is that?Three: You are a Cool Person. I said so.What do you think?

{"title": "Close Reading 4", "date": "Thursday, March 16, 2017", "text": "Zestful Blog Post # 203Welcome to the fourth installment of Close Reading, where Ianalyze a passage of published writing as to why and how it works or doesn’t.[Passage begins:]So much of the war is sitting around and doing nothing,waiting for somebody else. With no guarantee of the amount of time you haveleft it doesn’t seem worth starting even a train of thought. Doing what theyhad done so often before, the sentries moved out. Anything that stirred aheadof us now was enemy. The lieutenant marked his map and reported our positionover the radio. A noonday hush fell: even the mortars were quiet and the airwas empty of planes. One man doodled with a twig in the dirt of the farmyard.After a while it was as if we had been forgotten by war. I hoped that Phuonghad sent my suits to the cleaners. A cold wind ruffled the straw of the yard,and a man went modestly behind a barn to relieve himself. I tried to rememberwhether I had paid the British Consul in Hanoi for the bottle of whisky he hadallowed me.[Passage ends]--Graham Greene, from Chapter 2, part 1 of The Quiet AmericanI chose this paragraph of description because of itsmastery. If you’re not familiar with Greene’s novel, it’s about a love triangleand international intrigue during the early stages of what became known toAmericans as the Vietnam War. The novel was published in 1955. [Ah, those reliable orange-spined Penguin editions... Photo by ES]The narrator, Fowler, talks here of doing nothing, butactually we learn that much—very much—is going on, and we learn what it’s liketo be in the middle of it. What is going on is a mission within a war, a warover territory. Fowler, a journalist, is embedded within a fighting unit. Greenedemonstrates enviable style and economy in this passage. “Doing what they haddone so often before—” He could have explained that this unit had been oncountless missions all over the place, how busy they’d been. Not necessary, theway he does it.“...it doesn’t seem worth starting even a train of thought.”And indeed Fowler does not: he describes what he sees; he wonders if hisgirlfriend has sent his suits out; half a minute later he tries to rememberabout the bottle of whisky.This passages sets mood, and it builds subtly ourunderstanding of Fowler. This last, from what he chooses not to tell us. Hedoes not tell us he’s scared stiff—he’s not. Neither is he excited to be partof this operation. He doesn’t speak of any feelings of admiration for thesoldiers of either side—he hasn’t any. Fowler, we are shown, is adispassionate, probably jaded, observer of the complex multinational conflict the roots of which ran back at least to the 1850s, when France began its colonization of Indochina.What else do we learn here? We learn the ambient conditions:it’s cold and windy. (How to tell us it’s windy? Show the wind doing something:ruffling the straw in the yard.) We learn what time it is: around noon. Welearn that a lieutenant is in charge, thus—if we have any knowledge of militaryranking—we can deduce that this fighting unit is fairly small, on the level ofa platoon. They’re hiding out on a farm. No one is excited or agitated; theseare professional soldiers, and though they’d doubtless rather be smoking cigarsand fishing, or banging tail in Saigon, they’re here and they don’t have muchchoice than to be resigned to it. We learn that Fowler expects to return fromthis engagement (the suits to the cleaners).This is the kind of passage I call generous. (See Zestful Blog post March 27, 2014.) The passage is not absolutely necessary, but becauseGreene was a serious writer—he strove for beauty of style, depth of expression,and economy—he felt it important to give us this paragraph, to help us inhabitthe scene and the character. And we are richer for it. As a writer you do thesethings so that later you can do more things, and the reader is with youbeautifully, deeply, and economically.What do you think?

Seek truth and bear witness to it.Feel what you feel.Spiritual leaders figured out the hard path for us. WhenChrist said give away everything and follow me, he meant it literally. Very fewhave the guts to do that; I’m sitting here in my house, surrounded bypossessions. But we all give everything away sooner or later, the latestopportunity being the moment of death. When we die, we leave all ourpossessions. Why not start much earlier? Here’s the connection. For an artist,the act of giving it away must happen at each work session if authenticity isto be achieved. You write the sentences, you stroke the paint on the canvas,you cut the cloth and sew the seam. You put it out there; you give it, withcomplete abandon. Giving often, giving without reservation: that’s the path toquality.Creating a quality product is one thing. Getting thatproduct into the hands of paying consumers is another, and worth doing.

{"title": "Facepalming for Precision", "date": "Thursday, March 2, 2017", "text": "Zestful Blog Post #201One reason I love modern times is how fast a new word orusage can get around—provided it’s a word or usage I like. Mostly I loveinvention. One of my favorite terms, born, it appears, around the turn of thiscentury, is ‘facepalm.’ I get so much satisfaction and amusement when I see it;it’s just so blunt, economical, and natural. But sadly, I find myself needingto facepalm too often. I facepalm mainly when confronted by sloppy spelling andusage. It’s everywhere. In the past week alone, I’ve facepalmed at least twice.The first was while reading a bestselling memoir, in whichthe author describes a favorite dress when she was a little girl. It had pretty‘shearing’ on the front. WTF? This got past the author, her editor, and thecopy editor? Three professional word people, at least two of whom probably hadMFAs? Nobody knew WTF ‘shirring’ is? And nobody thought to go, “Huh, I’ve neverheard of shearing being on a dress. How can shearing, which is a verb, be afeature on an item of clothing? Maybe I should look it up. And if I can’t findsome kind of reference, maybe I should simply pick up the phone and call a tailor,or my Uncle Spiff, who loves to sew.” It isn’t even pronounced like shearing,it’s pronounced ‘shurring.’ (Shirring is a gathering of fabric to make tiny humpyrows. You’ve seen it on little girls’ dresses and Uncle Spiff's aprons.)Another facepalm occurred while reading the magazine Popular Mechanics. An article about anew ‘smart’ bazooka referred to the weapon’s ‘breach.’ WTF, nobody caught thateither? Breach means a gap, basically. ‘Breech’ is the word for the rear end ofthe bore of a gun. (BC, thanks again for the gift of that mag.)[In the case of a revolver, as here, the breech is exposed when the cylinder is released. Photo by ES.]What is the core issue here? A lack of general knowledge, I think.Am I wrong? Spell-check will not catch misuses like these. I would not be upsetreading these errors in a middle school student’s paper. But professionals aresupposed to know better. What is the solution? That people should read more andpay attention more? Help me. How can this situation be improved?Philanthropists like to donate money and assistance to the arts, and they liketo donate money and assistance to the eradication of human scourges likedisease and hunger. Can all the money in the world fix shearing instead of shirring?I know that even the repeated abuse of shearing instead of shirring will notresult in a child going hungry, or malaria claiming another million victims. Soit cannot be very important. Yet I facepalm. And I facepalm.OK, but! I just had a pretend conversation with the copyeditor of the shearing book, and do you know what he said? He said, “Oh, myGod, it was horrible. You have no idea how many mistakes I caught and corrected! That one slipped through.Sorry.” I feel better now. A little bit.What do you think?

{"title": "Seriously: HT Write with a Wood-Cased Pencil", "date": "Thursday, February 23, 2017", "text": "Zestful Blog Post #199This will just take a minute, but you've stayed with me this far, you will thank me. I’vebeen doing a lot of writing lately with wood-cased pencils, premium ones thatwrite nice and smooth. They tend to be expensive, so I’ve beenconscious of making best use of them. ‘Best use’ of a pencil means wasting aslittle as possible, which means minimizing the number of times it goes into thesharpener.Also, as a handwriter of first drafts, I’m always lookingfor ways to minimize hand/arm fatigue.When you use a writing instrument such as a ballpoint pen,it makes sense to apply the point more or less vertically to the paper, to let moreof the ball contact the page. But if you apply a pencil that way,you dull the point fairly quickly, and the cramped positionof your hand promotes discomfort. But if you hold the pencil like this,  on a much shallower angle, and—this is key—if you rotate itevery so often, slightly, in your fingers, you’ll retain the point longer andneed to sharpen it less often. And see how the hand is in a more lengthened,relaxed position? I don't know why it took me so long to learn this.Here is a closeup, the one on the left showing the planes orfacets of a point used on a proper slant with occasional rotation, versus apoint dulled by clueless vertical positioning.[Photos by ES]I rest my (wood) case.What do you think?

{"title": "Kicking it Sideways", "date": "Thursday, February 16, 2017", "text": "Zestful Blog Post #198Here’s a meat patty from my article “Stepping upYour Sidekicks” in Writer’s Digest magazine.The most memorablesidekicks possess some or all of these attributes:- They are fiercely loyal to the hero.- They are different in at least one keyrespect from the hero: in temperament, class, gender, race, age, etc.- They possess a strong moral compass (rogues,like the HAL 9000, being the notable exception).- They have unique, useful skills.- They’re somehow dependent on the hero, ifonly emotionally.- They don’t try to overshadow or be morevaluable than the hero.- They have unique backstories and characterarcs.- They’re too essential to the hero and thestory to be killed off.[Old kicks. Cut and split a lot of wood in these, in days of yore...]How to doit:Choose alikely candidate. You can’t go wrong by selecting the person closest toyour protagonist: the spouse, sibling, or best friend.Give thatcharacter a reason to drop everything (or almost everything) and follow thehero. You might need to plant an event earlier in that character’s life,like a nasty boss who needs to be told off: “And what’s more, I QUIT!”  You could ship your sidekick’s husband out onmilitary duty for six months, or send the kids to summer camp—anything thatwill plausibly free up that secondary character to step in.Considergiving the sidekick a meaty backstory. This will help you create a rich characterarc for that person. The generic elementary school teacher might be given amajor life regret: “I wish I’d stuck with it and gotten my Ph.D.—then I wouldn’tbe dealing with mouthy ten-year-olds every day…” Or the dude in the nextcubicle might be starting a business, or preparing to take his black belt examin judo, or recovering from PTSD.In order tocement loyalty or friendship, plant an event in which the hero does somethingto save the future sidekick’s bacon. The hero could bail his sidekick outof jail, throw himself under the bus literally or figuratively, or stand up toa bully. Or reverse the situation: Perhaps the sidekick, currently a stranger,saves the hero somehow, which leads to their relationship. The hero can thenwork to show gratitude to the sidekick, who continues to help the hero.Keep yoursidekick separate from your mentor (if you have one). If you force your mentorto do double duty as a sidekick, you risk disrupting the balance of power inyour story—and confusing the reader. This is because the mentor always has higherstatus than the hero, while the sidekick, by definition, should have lowerstatus.Leverageconflict and suspense. Sidekicks are great for this. They can make terriblemistakes, thus complicating things for your hero (and themselves). They canbumble into a situation that turns out fabulous. Or they can simply sit andworry while the hero is off heroing.Throw somerocks along the relationship path. I find as a reader and writer thatgiving a sidekick and hero some ups and downs enriches the story. Think of itthis way: If a stranger walked up to you and punched you in the nose unprovoked,it would be a shocking surprise, but if the person you’ve counted on the most—foughtalongside, gotten drunk with—punched you in the nose, that’s a wholedifferent—and bigger—story. If your hero and sidekick experience seriousrelationship problems, the reader gets to enjoy a row or two, while having thebasic confidence that the band will always get back together.Considergiving your villain a sidekick. A villain’s sidekick usually gets stuckwith the label henchman, is typicallya brainless thug, and eventually gets blown away by the good guy. However, Ibelieve villainous sidekicks are grossly underutilized by contemporary authors.What do you think?

{"title": "Mindful Practice", "date": "Thursday, February 9, 2017", "text": "Zestful Blog Post #197Last week I discussed how keeping a commitment to somethingcan yield good—even great—results, as one incrementally improves. A comment by BJ made me reflect, though, that there’s moreto it than showing up and wanting to get better—you have to put in effort. Youhave to do work, real work, and not just make a show of it.Now, I mean, showing up is massive, especially for us writers,who get serenaded by a hundred distractions every day. But after reading BJ’scomment, I thought about my writing in relation to my swimming, golf, drums,and other pursuits. I remembered something a sports coach said to me once: “Practicedoesn’t necessarily make perfect; practice makes permanent.” His point was thatif you practice with poor technique, or if you feel indifferent toward what you’redoing, your performance will stagnate.It’s true. When I was a lifeguard I’d study the regular swimmers,and noted that few ever worked toward improvement. Pretty much everybody wouldshow up, put in their lengths using whatever half-assed stroke they’d learnedyears ago, at exactly the same pace, then leave. Same with golf. Mostrecreational players don’t take lessons, don’t study the game, don’t practice,and have shitty swings.I’ve found only one kindred spirit in the pool who, like me,strives for an ever more efficient stroke. Like me, he does drills andintervals, he mixes up his workout, and even does fun random stuff like swim alength of backstroke balancing his water bottle on his forehead. (Yeah, myGod.) He’s the faster of the two of us, I’m the smoother. It’s enjoyable towork out in adjacent lanes. So, yeah, if you seek to improve by searching outgood advice and then practice with mindfulness and intentionality, then you’llget somewhere. You’ll improve, be fruitful, flourish.In sports, being mindful pretty much boils down toawareness: Am I letting the water support my head? Is my spine staying in line withmy head when I roll to breathe? Are my hands relaxed? The trick is not to TRY.Don’t try to relax your hands. Just notice whether they feel relaxed or not.This frees you up to be OK with whatever is. No judging necessary, no callingsomething good or bad. This lets awareness work its subtle magic for you. Dittofor meditative practices like yoga, where you’re supposed to let body tensiongo before attempting even simple poses. Yoga teachers talk about awareness allthe time.What about writing? Reading great books with fine attention helpsa writer get better. Is there more we can do to effect ongoing improvement,apart from showing up and slamming down words? Unlike performance in sport,which can be measured by a clock or points on a board, the worthiness of anypiece of writing is subjective to some extent.But let’s just say it isn’t. Let’s say we can tell if our writingis getting better or staying the same. Let’s give ourselves that much credit.I think awareness holds tremendous potential for us. And the body is the gateway to the mind and spirit. Unnecessarytension in any of the three—body, mind, spirit—will block us from doing ourbest. The absence of needless mental, emotional, and physical tension willfacilitate our best.So: As you settle down to write, ask yourself: Am I feeling any unnecessary physical tension? Feel it, andsee whether it changes. Then ask: tension emotionally? Mentally? Feel it, andsee what happens.Right now, try dropping your jaw. Was it tense? How does itfeel now? (In my blog post of August 1, 2013, I discussed thisrelaxing-your-jaw thing while writing. I thought it was cool, but didn’t takeit any further.)As you begin to write, touch base on the question of tensionfrom time to time, and add a second one: Am I feeling pleasure as I write? Don’task: Is what’s coming onto the page good? Ask: Am I enjoying this? Don’t evenattempt to figure out why or why not.Let’s try it and see what happens!What do you think?

{"title": "Slowly Faster", "date": "Thursday, February 2, 2017", "text": "Zestful Blog Post #196Last year on my 59th birthday (and let us speakno more of such numbers), I began a journal with the intention of writing in itevery day. So far, I’ve missed only about five days. Those missed days are a greatlesson about happiness. You committed to do this thing; you have done itimperfectly; you can’t, today, write yesterday’s entry. You can write about yesterday, OK, good, but the pastis past, and imperfection must be all right. Missed opportunities must be OK.Otherwise—what? Cut your throat? Yeah, no. Smile and go on.In my journal last night I wrote about my midday swim. I’vebeen surprised, lately, to find myself overtaking swimmers in neighboring laneswho’ve either been faster than, or about the same as me. I wrote, “Slowly,slowly, I’m getting faster.” I almost laughed aloud. Of course, ‘gradually’would have been a better word than ‘slowly,’ but the point is this: Improvementis often so subtly incremental that you don’t notice it, especially after youreach some level of basic competence. You see where I’m going with this.There’s a big difference between wanting to write, and bangingout a complete short story. A big difference between a handful of short storiesand a novel.There’s a much smaller difference between a short story anda better short story. Or is there? What of the difference between a novel you’regrateful to have completed, and a novel the writing of which changed your life?If you stay true to your commitment—even if imperfectly, andyou will be imperfect—you may get better, but you will certainly andcontinually give yourself chances toget better. Yay for incremental improvement; don’t let it slip by unnoticed.Because those spaces between the small increments? That’s where the magic is.What do you think?

Mine sure is!The best news I offer today is Crimes in a Second Language, now available on Amazon. Crimes is a departure from series work for me—this is a standalonenovel about the relationship between two very different women in contemporaryLos Angeles. The story was inspired by my late, great aunt and her relationshipwith a Mexican-American housecleaner. From the back cover:Is smart and deadbetter than dumb and safe?Elnice Coker and her husband Arthur, retired schoolteachers,move from Indiana to the Hollywood Hills in a last-ditch attempt at novelty andhappiness. California alone can’t do the trick, but when Elnice befriends herhousecleaner, Solita, her life opens up to friendship and intrigue. Elniceteaches Solita English although Solita’s common-law husband, Luis, is againstit. The women build a secret, tentative friendship.Meanwhile, wannabe novelist Jason M is busy writing faultyinformation into tech manuals for airplane-making machines at a factory in theValley. One of a swarm of corporate saboteurs scattered around Los Angeles,he’s bossed by a nameless, exacting mentor. But when he begins to have ethicaldoubts, he discovers it’s harder to get out than it was to get in.The lure of easy money casts its spell over everybody, andas Elnice and Solita grow closer, they encounter treachery and danger wherethey least expect it. The saboteurs intertwine, innocent lives hang in thebalance, and as Elnice risks everything to dig deeper, she learns the value ofrejecting safety—and living life to the max.

Wecover the writer’s life, writing techniques, language use and abuse, andwhatever else seems worthy to talk about of a Thursday afternoon. I keep writing articles for Writer’s Digest magazine andtheir various special editions; currently you’ll find my pieces in the January,February, and March/April issues. (After that, a bit of a break…but I’ve sentalong some new ideas to the mag, so we’ll see what’s next.) I contributed to thenew edition of the Complete Handbook of Novel Writing, from Writer’s Digest Books.I’m developing ideas for online teaching, so stay tuned forthat. Am also working on Best Boy,the fourth in the Rita Farmer mystery series.Here’s the beginning of Crimes in a Second Language:1: The Dog Does Not AnswerA white woman with her hair in a bunand perspiration spangling her upper lip disembarks a bus in a Los Angelesneighborhood she’s never been to before. Her stomach jiggles but not in anuncomfortable way. She is old enough to know the rewards of daily fibersupplements, sensible enough to be undaunted riding a bus into this place—inthe daytime anyway—and desperate enough to do what she is about to do. The busdriver glances sideways with a molecule of curiosity as she hops down.Desperation breeds nerve.Nerve breeds action.And this woman must act. Today. Lethally.She walks one block in a random direction, her dusty whiteKeds rolling over the craggy sidewalk, her head swiveling as she franklyscrutinizes the storefronts. This is the right neighborhood, or really it is a right neighborhood.Liquor-Lotto-Meat.Pawn Town.Ned’s Bar-B-Q and Sons.Suellen Beauty.Dangerous-looking characters drive past, their arms flexedsternly over their steering wheels. A baby wails in a loopy rhythm.Not long ago, for sure, this woman would have beenfrightened to be here. But she’s got a grip on this city now—all of it. Shebelongs here.A stray dog emerges from between two parked cars and humblyapproaches. The woman perceives that the dog, half pit bull at least, is afemale who must be nursing puppies somewhere; her teats are pronounced and low.It follows her, licks her hand from behind, circles around and looks up at her.“What do you want to tell me, little dog?” Her voice isslender and clear, in contrast to her fat belly. Her words originate at theroot of her tongue, not quite throatily; hers is an earnest voice that would beappropriate for a simultaneous interpreter or a documentary narrator.Her name is Elnice M. Coker and she was married to Arthur T.“Bullet” Coker until yesterday, when he died before her eyes. His death wasinappropriate and ghastly, but chosen. “Elnice” had been his last word.She wishes people wouldn’t mispronounce it. Elnice rhymeswith Elvis; in fact the names share a Teutonic root.Elnice is feeling desperate, nervy, and lethal because shehas learned that slow death is not the worst thing that can happen. Her shadowswings along beneath her, keen in the caustic light of the city today.A cluster of needle-eyed little boys in pyramidal pants giveher and the dog a once-over. They can’t finger it but she looks different. Notbecause she’s white and wearing dirty clothes—other soiled white people live inthe neighborhood. Perhaps it is her purposeful manner. Not acute enough yet to perceiveor care, the boys go back to their boasting.“I’m serious.”“My butthole.”“Did too. I am serious.”“My sweet butthole.”The dog does not answer Elnice’s question. She cocks herhead at the animal—just in case—but it remains silent. Everything is all right;Elnice has made her deal with God, and everything is all right.Another liquor store presents itself. She examines theexterior and, evidently finding something favorable, walks in. She pretends toshop for pretzels until her eyes adjust to the stale light. She turns to theman behind the smeared plexi barrier. He is a Korean with a pencil-linemustache, close to her in age, whose years of running this liquor store inSouth Los Angeles have given his face the look of a tombstone made of old wood.“I want to buy a handgun,” she tells him, “off the street.Do you know someone who can help me?”[Keep reading!]Thank you for being my friend!ElizabethWhat do you think?

{"title": "Plot Pivots", "date": "Thursday, January 19, 2017", "text": "Zestful Blog Post #194I want to share with you some good stuff from my article, “21Ways to Pivot Your Plot,” in the January 2017 issue of Writer’s Digestmagazine. (Special thanks to top-dog editor Jessica Strawser for her work on this pieceand so many others I’ve written.)A pivot point is an essential fulcrum upon which a story ora large swath of story turns. Archimedes, standing there next to the Earth withhis lever, would understand! More significant than an ordinary plot point(which might merely serve to impart information or develop character), a pivotpoint effectively changes the direction of a character or action sequence. Hugewhen used as a foundation for a story, a pivot point can also be a smallpowerhouse for plot movement.If your outline or story hangs together but lacks zing or seemsto be missing something, take a look and see if there’s an opportunity tocreate a pivot point, or three. Some may be more or less dropped in via a new characteror subplot; others would require more planning to effectively incorporate. Letthese ideas get you going. (Warning: plot spoilers ahead, in the name oflearning by example. This is the life we’ve chosen …)[Here's a pivot point we can all relate to.]1. Drop a house.TheWonderful Wizard of Oz by L. Frank Baum features any number of important turningpoints, the most central (and literal) of which is the tornado, which causes Dorothy’stransit to Munchkin Country. While the tornado is definitely the incitingincident, the most significant pivot point in the early going is the fact thatDorothy’s house crushes to death the Wicked Witch of the East. Which earnsDorothy the malignant enmity of the Wicked Witch of the West. Which instantlycreates life-and-death urgency during every minute of Dorothy’s journey.You too can create an accident that brings an innocentcharacter into the crosshairs of an unforgiving antagonist, be it a car wreck ora spilled drink or a bump in an elevator.2. Create a ghost.Some plot points can pivot more thanone way; an example might be the introduction of Boo Radley in Harper Lee’s To Kill a Mockingbird. The children’sobsession with him leads them to approach his creepy house; Boo’s secret gifts tothe kids serve to reveal his true nature; and of course without Boo, Scoutwould not have lived to tell her tale. In this case the pivot point is theultimate force for good.Of course, Boo was a man, not a ghost. But you can take thatidea and make it your own. The point is, a force that quietly crops up here andthere can suffuse your plot with real tension and mystery.3. Give somebody charge oversomething.The classic fairy tale of Jack andthe Beanstalk pivots beautifully on this. Jack’s mother, instead of takingtheir cow to market herself, entrusts young Jack to do the job. Before he evenreaches town, he gets suckered into giving the cow to an old man who offers hima few supposedly magic beans for it. He catches hell, but all ends well.The injunction, “Don’t screw it up!” is an automatic pivotpoint, because it applies relentless pressure to whoever’s entrusted with thetask.4. Suppress a conscience.In Theodore Dreiser’s An American Tragedy, a key pivot pointcomes fairly late in the story, but it’s correctly placed for maximum impact.

{"title": "Q & A with Mark Gottlieb", "date": "Thursday, January 12, 2017", "text": "Zestful Blog Post #193A few months ago the literary agent Mark Gottlieb, ofthe Trident Media Group, offered to do an interview here at Zestful Writing. I’djust published a post about this blog being strictly my idiosyncratic take onthings, and explaining why I never seek out content written by anybody else. Itold Mark hey, get in touch after the first of the year and maybe we can do aninterview. I figured he’d just be like, screw it and not bother, and then I wouldn’thave to actually say no to this guy who works for one of the most prestigiousagencies in the world.[Just had to throw in a snapshot of NYC.]But he did get in touch, and I thought, OK, I have torespect somebody who follows up like a professional. So I shot him a fewquestions. Below are his answers in their entirety. Needless to say, the reasonpeople do these things is to promote their business or ideas. But Mark alsooffers some finger-on-the-pulse insights I found worthwhile, and I hope you dotoo. And hey, you might consider getting in touch with him when you have amanuscript ready to go!Whatdo literary agents talk about when they get together for drinks after a longday at a writer’s conference?In order to makethe best of my time, I tend to avoid other literary agents at conferences,focusing instead on attaining new clients and helping new writers grow intopublished authors. I’m not usually one to try and make idle chat or nicetieswith the competition, but I have in the past had the opportunity to hear fromother literary agents, after they’ve had the liquid truth serum. Mostly it’skvetching about the state of book publishing and how much they despise Amazonbut can’t live without it. I’ve also heard other literary agents talk about howthey struggled in first trying to sell fiction and/or commercial fiction andhave instead taken to churning small nonfiction deals, since nonfiction isgenerally easier to sell. Conversely, fiction and commercial fiction is ourbread and butter at Trident Media Group, though we do rank just as highly innonfiction deals. Howwould you describe your business model? Have you made any changes in responseto the digital- / self-publishing revolution? If so, what?It is all too easyfor an author to feel discouraged and turn to self-publishing or small indiepublishing. However, many successful self-published authors eventually go intotraditional publishing in order to take advantage of having a team ofprofessionals who help them take their work to the next level.A literary agencywith industry knowledge and expertise can bring a huge value add to the tablefor an author, evidenced by many of the success stories we’ve created for ourclients, the bulk of which are award-winning and bestselling authors. We’veactually built a lot of self-published success stories into mega-bestsellers,giving authors a Godzilla-like footprint in the industry.Trident Media Groupis a full-service literary agency for authors, handling accounting, legalreview, management, foreign rights (books in translation), book-to-film/TV,audio books, etc. We’re also a literary agency with tremendous clout in theindustry, so we can get many things for authors from publishers and film / TVbuyers that an author otherwise would not be able to get on their own.I’d like to thinkthat a literary agency would save an author a lot of headaches in order to helpthe author focus in on their own writing, thereby allowing the author to becomemore prolific. Meanwhile, the literary agent would work in concert with theirsubsidiary rights people and departments within the literary agency. In lookingat a literary agent and considering paying them a commission on a deal, anauthor should be asking what they stand to gain in having a literary agent.The digital landscapehas seen our literary agency evolve. Thanks to the tremendous resourcesavailable to our company and our Digital Media and Publishing department,Trident Media Group often helps our clients in their marketing/publicityefforts. We also try to put the publisher on the hot seat in encouraging themto perform marketing/publicity tasks for the author, by sharing ideas andhaving in-depth meetings with publishers.Trident will alsomake recommendations to our clients on how they can think about improving theirsocial media presence and look to online efforts to market / promote theirbooks. Otherwise, book publishers normally devote their marketing dollars andother resources toward authors that are huge successes or are making a majordebut.We at Trident mighteven recommend a private book publicity firm to a client, but that doesn’t comecheap. An author should still know that their role in marketing and promotingthe book is integral to the process since, at the end of the day, readers /fans will want to hear from the author.What’sone thing agents don’t tell authors?Literary agents maybe reluctant to tell authors how they and their literary agency ranks onPublishers Marketplace’s site. Many authors, who are just plain happy to havefound a literary agent, don’t always choose the right sort of agency for notasking that question of a literary agent. We at Trident Media Group are bookpublishing’s leading literary agency as we rank #1 for overall and six-figure+deals (highest monetary category an agency can rank for) onpublishersmarketplace.com, both for fiction, nonfiction, and agencies. We haveranked that way for over a decade, which is how long Publishers Marketplace hasbeen around. That means we have numerous #1 NYT bestselling authors and manyaward-winning authors. When a new author looks at a big agency like ours, whichis close to fifty employees and takes up the entire 36th floor of a Madison Avebuilding, they often think they will get lost in the shuffle, when in realityit is really quite the opposite. This being a big agency means that we havedevoted legal, accounting, audio, digital, office management and foreign rightsdepartments, which means I can spend more time with my clients, focusing ontheir careers. This is not to speak ill of other agencies, but the same cannotbe said of a very small agency tight on resources where agents there,by-and-large, must work in a vacuum, and therefore have little time to properlyhandle audio and foreign rights, unlike an agency of our stature.Who’syour favorite author of all time?My favorite book isRalph Ellison’s INVISIBLE MAN as it helped me through a difficult time in mylife and made me feel as though I had a friend in that book.Thank you, Mark![This is sexist, right, but isn't he the cutest thing?]Mark Gottlieb attended Emerson College and was President ofits Publishing Club, establishing the Wilde Press. After graduating with adegree in writing, literature & publishing, he began his career withPenguin’s VP. Mark’s first position at Publishers Marketplace’s #1-rankedliterary agency, Trident Media Group, was in foreign rights. Mark was EA toTrident’s Chairman and ran the Audio Department. Mark is currently working withhis own client list, helping to manage and grow author careers with the uniqueresources available to Trident. He has ranked #1 among Literary Agents onpublishersmarketplace.com in Overall Deals and other categories.What do you think of this interview?

{"title": "The Not-Caring Trick", "date": "Thursday, January 5, 2017", "text": "Zestful Blog Post #192Not caring. That’s the paradox of quality achievement: Letyour arrow fly with as much preparation and sincerity as possible—but don’tcare where it goes! For then and only then will the shot, or the work, beworthwhile. Then and only then will it—canit—fly true and find its target.Not everybody gets this, not everybody is open to this, nomatter what. I remember talking golf with a friend a few years ago. My friendand I were mediocre golfers. I’d been experimenting with the ‘don’t care whereit goes’ mindset after hearing the great champion Annika Sorenstam explain thatthe only way she can swing freely and produce beautiful shots is to not carewhere the ball goes. Also, I’d been reading similar ideas in books like EugenHerrigel’s Zen in the Art of Archery.I got the gist immediately; the paradox appealed to my seeker’s heart. I sawhow it can work. Take a hall-of-fame athlete like Annika: Well, her ball went exactlywhere she aimed it thousands of times, not in spite of her not-caring, butbecause of it.I started to share this idea with my friend over a beerafter a round. But she stiffened and interrupted, “I can’t do that. I DO carewhere my ball goes.”I tried to explain, but in her view, not caring where yourball goes must absolutely, necessarily result in poor shots and awful scores.To her, not caring about the flight of her ball meant not trying hard duringthe swing; it meant slapping indiscriminately at the ball. Not caring, to my friend, meant being lazy. It meant not caringabout the process. And that’s where she got it wrong.‘Trying’ has ruined many an effort, whether golf shot,pirouette, or writing session. Trying usually means tightening, or attemptingto force something. Furthermore, there is an element of fear in caring aboutresults. Gosh, I hope I don’t hit it into the water. Gosh, I hope this piece ofwriting doesn’t turn out stupid.But my friend would not or could not separate process from result.I finally gave up, telling her bluntly, “Then you’re doomed.” She shrugged offmy nonsense. She doesn’t golf much anymore.If you take pleasure in the swing, in the process, if you abandon yourself to the process, ifyou simply practice being aware without trying to change or even get better, ifyou go deeply into the process alone, be as present as possible, feel all thepleasure and joy of it—that’s when beautiful, satisfying results will come.Go forth and attend to your process. Swing it. May the Forcebe with you.What do you think?

She thought of the concept, and I executedit. All the writing implements are mine, from my various stashes. Aftercrafting the display on our dining-room table (the tablecloth, linen—Ikea—and Inever iron), I realized just how rich I am in stuff that makes words. Andthat’s not even all! More pens, pencils, inks, and sharpeners lay neatly in myBisleys and office cupboard. (Art supply buffs will know Bisleys.) I even havea Caran d’Ache rotary sharpener, though not the eye-popping Matterhorn edition.Perhaps next year you could all chip in and get me one.[Can you find the humblest of these items: the DetroitPublic Schools pencil I picked up from the floor of the orchestra room at CassTechnical High School on a visit this year?]But seriously, I’ve been thinking about how rich I am in somany things, the best of them not for sale: health, family, friends, faithfulreaders. Often, when I get down about something or other I’ll give thanks forstuff I don’t have, like a prison sentencefor killing somebody in a car accident that’s my fault.Also, because it’s the Christmas season—going aheadwith “Christmas” here, because I do celebrate it, more or less—I’ve been thinking, “Whatwould Jesus Write?” And I realize the real question is: “How Would Jesus Write?”The answer is clear and simple, when you think how tuned in that guy was: Withfaith.

{"title": "More Precision", "date": "Thursday, December 15, 2016", "text": "Zestful Blog Post #189In my ongoing campaign for precise language and spelling,today I offer:No:The suspect’s account did not jive with the victim’s.Yes:The suspect’s account did not jibe with the victim’s.No:Don’t give me that jibe; I know you went bowling last night.Yes:Don’t give me that jive; I know you went bowling last night.Yes:I don’t like the cut of his jib.To jibe is to agree with or be consistent with. To jive isto talk nonsense, fib, or play jazz; to improvise. But jive is being used socommonly to mean jibe that it’s appearing in dictionaries that way. Please joinme in resisting that jive. A jib is a triangular sail on a boat, or a part of acrane. The idiomatic usage, “I don’t like the cut of his jib” means to dislikehow someone looks or be suspicious of someone.While watching an episode of “Mad Men” I was gratified whenBert Cooper corrected one of his underlings. One of the guys said, “I’m hip tothat.” Cooper cut in, “It’s hep.”Just like jive and jibe, hip and hep have become confused. To be hip is to be fashionable and up to the minute; to be hepis to be knowledgeable.Moving along to:No:If these voices in my head keep up, I’ll soon be in astraightjacket.Yes:If these voices in my head keep up, I’ll soon be in astraitjacket.Strait means narrow, restricted, which is what one of thosegarments does to a person. Straight means extending in one direction with nodeviation. But again, the misuse is so common, both spellings are becomingacceptable. Just not by me.Also, let’s consider:No:That point is so obtuse, nobody here can understand it.Yes:That point is so abstruse, nobody here can understand it.Yes:He’s the most obtuse student I’ve ever tried to teach.Abstruse means obscure or difficult to grasp; obtuse means dumb ordull. (An obtuse angle in geometry is one with a blunt—or dull—point: greaterthan 90 degrees and less than 180.) (Thanks, RM!)Lastly, a few fine points involving vowels:Each of these drums is a timpano. Together, they are timpani. When I play them, I call them timps.When cheering a mezzo-soprano, yell “Brava!” When cheeringa tenor, yell “Bravo!” When cheering the ensemble, yell “Bravi!” If you’rereally excited, yell “Bravissimo!”A man travels incognito. A woman travels incognita. When a guy conducts an orchestra, he is a maestro. When agal does it, she is a maestra. (Hilarious that my auto-speller tried to reject maestra. Also timpano.)All right, I feel better.What do you think?

{"title": "Of Precision I Sing", "date": "Thursday, December 8, 2016", "text": "Zestful Blog Post #188If you’re a stickler for precise language and spelling,these are dark times. The rise of voice-to-text software, declining literacyrates (at least in the U.S.—I read about it), and the hurried way we oftenproduce and consume words—all of this is adding up. Also, OK, I’m all for STEM.STEM for president. STEM for lucrative, clean-hands jobs. But more emphasis onSTEM means less emphasis on literature. I’m sorry, but it does. And it shows. And I grieve.OK, here are some commonly misused words, with corrections.I am driven to write this today. I know word meanings change over time, oftenbecause of sloppy usage. But let us not be part of that hideous process.Reticent / ReluctantNo:He was reticent to open the door.Yes:He was reluctant to open the door.No:She was reticent to speak about what she’d gone through.Yes:She was reluctant to speak about what she’d gone through.Yes:She was reticent about what she’d gone through.Reticent means being unwilling to speak; the origin isLatin, for ‘be silent.’Reluctant means being unwilling to do something.An announcer said this on the radio yesterday: “But the schoolprincipal was accused of flaunting the rules.” No. You flout the rules, youflaunt your six-pack abs at the beach.Keeping to the ‘f’ theme, let’s look at another pair:No:The ship floundered on the reef and was lost.Yes:The ship foundered on the reef.Yes:He floundered for months, then at last grasped the essenceof the theorem.Yes:They took control of the foundering company and made itprofitable again.To flounder is to struggle; to founder is to sink.Again, yesterday. I picked up a package of page tabs in astore—you know, those things like paperclips for marking pages in a book? Wasgoing to buy it until I read on the back that the tabs are ‘discrete’. Put itback. No, the tabs are discreet; they don’t hang out like sticky notes or thelike.So, no:Roger and Joan were discrete about their affair.Yes:Roger and Joan were discreet about their affair.No:Each file folder holds a discreet project. (Although, cometo think of it, if these were personnel records at a bordello, that could betrue.)Yes:Each file folder holds a discrete project.Although the words are related, discreet means to be cautiousor even guarded, while discrete simply means separate, individual.While we’re on homonyms:No:The demotion didn’t phase him.Yes:The demotion didn’t faze him.Yes:That model was phased out in 2011.Yes:My dog’s mood seems to depend on the phases of the moon.To faze is to disrupt or disturb. Phase can be a noun or averb; a phase is a stage or an episode, while to phase is to execute a sequence.No:The governor took a lot of flack for his statement on low-fatbutter.Yes:The governor took a lot of flak for his statement on low-fatbutter.Flak is anti-aircraft fire from ground positions; themetaphorical meaning is severe criticism.

If time travel,archaeology, ancient British history, ventriloquism, science, and off-kilterhumor hold any interest for you, check out Paxton's Worlds. Congratulations, Stan!The latest Writer’s Digest magazine (January 2017) is out,featuring a piece by yours truly, “21 Ways to Pivot Your Plot.” Here’s Editor-in-Chief Jessica Strawser’s blog about the issue. The theme is “WriteThat Novel!”, most appropriate for the New Year, I say. Lots of good stuff inthere.Was honored to have some of my work mentioned in a roundup of ‘best’ story writing advice by Jane Friedman recently. She’s put togetherquite a bouquet of sound material in that list, if I say so myself, so considerlooking in on it.OK. Today’s post is a pushback against Shakespeare abuse. Theother day I heard somebody say ‘To thine own self be true,’ to justify somelittle selfishness or other, and it made me mad, because that’s the opposite ofwhat Shakespeare really said. The quotation is incomplete.I remember my mother discussing this once, when I was aboutnine. She was attending college to become an English teacher, so naturally shewas studying Shakespeare. One day she was sitting with a cup of coffee at thekitchen table, musing, maybe more to herself than anything, about people screwingup this quotation. Then she must have noticed me standing there, and recitedthe full passage:[from the cover of my old Kittredge edition]“This above all—to thine own self be true,And it must follow as the night to day,Thou canst not then be false to any man.”The play is Hamlet,the speaker is the ill-fated Polonius, and he’s finishing up giving a bunch oflife wisdom to his son Laertes.Buddha would approve.

{"title": "A Skill Built to Last", "date": "Thursday, November 17, 2016", "text": "Zestful Blog Post #185Not long ago a new acquaintance—a fellow author—turned to meand said, “I hate you.” The context was neither a political argument nor adiscussion of whether Star Wars IV-VI could ever be surpassed.No, we were sitting side by side in a conference session,and I was taking notes on my computer, typing on the keyboard. Usually I takenotes longhand on paper, if at all, but I wanted to catch everything in thisparticular presentation.When the speaker paused, this new acquaintance, who had beenwatching me out of the corner of her eye, said, “You can type as fast as he cantalk.”I shrugged modestly. (I’ve gotten so good at those modestshrugs!)“And you don’t make mistakes.”(Self-deprecating murmur.)“I hate you.”Jesus, lady. Of course I knew she meant, “I envy you.” Whydo people say I hate you instead? Whatever. Yeah, I can touch-type prettyaccurately, and I’m always surprised when other authors can’t. Probably one ofthe most pragmatic decisions I ever made in high school was to take aone-semester typing class. I was already writing lots of papers and stories,and college was in the offing. At that time, however, part of the femalezeitgeist was like, “Don’t learn to type, because then you’ll just be asecretary forever!”[My keyboard. Oh, and there’s Cheetoh, the babydinosaur I rescued at the beach last year. He likes to hang out on my desk.]I was all for the women’s movement, and I certainlyperceived the need for it, but I thought, isn’t it like cutting off your noseto spite your face, to NOT learn something because of some principle? (I mean,you could always lie and say you can’t type, right?)Then after college I got a job as a reporter/photographer,and I sure had to type fast for that. Ahh, that good old IBM Selectric… Ifabsolute certainty had an aural profile, it would be the sound of an IBMSelectric ripping along on 20-lb bond.Needless to say, I cherish my typing skills now more thanever. Do they teach touch typing (meaning without looking at the keys) inschools these days? Ah, a quick search reveals it’s now called ‘keyboardingskills.’ OK. If you Google ‘how to type’ you’ll find free tutorials on line. Becauseit’s never too late to learn.

{"title": "Word Quota Magic", "date": "Thursday, November 3, 2016", "text": "Zestful Blog Post #183When you’re writing original material—fiction or nonfiction—settinga word-count goal for your writing session is rewarding on a surface level, butalso on a deeper, magical level you don’t understand until you do it.Surface level is obvious: If you get words down, you’rewriting; you’re making measurable progress. Whether your product is good or badis, at this point, irrelevant.Now for the deeper reward of chasing your word quota.As you write, somewhere in the back of your mind is ‘Gottamake word count.’ That alone makes you reallynot want to cross stuff out, hesitate, choose one way to say something overanother, cut off that rabbit trail you’ve been following because, enough.You’re more likely to write deep into something, to not ‘keepmoving forward’ but to linger on something you thought might be minor. Since I’m here and I really have to make wordcount before I can stop writing, I might as well keep going on this, drilldown, because I’m already ON this vein of ore.You’re more likely to experience flow.Only when you’re sure you’ve exhausted that vein must youcome up and figure out what might be next, or what could be next. And shift tothat and write.When you go back over that material, you might decide tokeep or throw, but material written under word-quota pressure will have thegreatest chance of containing something wonderful, surprising, totally cool:something you had no idea was going to appear, something you wouldn’t havewanted to miss for the world.When you choose quantity over quality in the early going,you’re giving yourself WAY more chances to come up with something brilliant.

{"title": "Ten-Minute Enigma", "date": "Thursday, October 27, 2016", "text": "Zestful Blog Post #182This happened on October 21 at approximately 9:25 a.m. atthe Florida Writers Association conference. ‘Crystal Ballroom C’ in the Hiltonhotel, Altamonte Springs. Some of you were there.[But oh, first I gotta give a shout-out to the Royal Palm Literary Award Winners. Special congratulations tofrequent Zestful blog commenter Tricia Pimental, and to my St. Augustinecrit-group member Melody Dean Dimick, who won two awards! Have I overlooked anyblog follower? Lemme know.]OK, the enigma. I arrived at about 9:00 to set up for mypresentation scheduled for 9:20, “How to Write Dialogue Like a Pro” and foundthe room already filling up. There were about 10 of those big round tablesseating 8. Or maybe it was 8 tables seating 10. Anyway, over the course of thenext fifteen minutes the place got packed, so much so that people wereresigning themselves to standing room. Gratifying for me, but problematic forthe conference, because attendees were still trying to crowd in.At 9:20 I received a nice introduction from Nancy, one of themany unsung conference volunteers (so unsung that I can’t remember her lastname), and began. After maybe five minutes, two or three hotel staff guys camein and began the process of transforming the wall between Crystal Ballroom Cand the currently unused Crystal Ballroom D from a solid thing to a hugeaccordion-fold of heavy panels. Writers intent on improving their dialogueskills happily moved to occupy the near tables in Crystal Ballroom D. This wasa bit disruptive, but one of those necessary things, and everybody was now morecomfortable. As the hotel guys shoved the panels into a compartment in the wallbehind me and left, I resumed talking, using slides and pictures to illustratemy brilliant points.Five minutes later a woman stood up and called out, “Excuseme, but my purse has been stolen!” “Maybe folks nearby could look around?” I said, checking mywatch and starting to worry about time lost. During the next few minutes peoplepeered beneath tables and chairs, despite the upset woman saying, “It isn’there. It isn’t here. It’s been stolen.”No one could find it; the purse was gone.“It would be a good idea to get hotel security involvedright away,” I suggested from the dais, and the woman hurried out. I sympathized;it’s terrible to lose your purse, and although the victim was distraught, Ithought she was doing a pretty good job of holding it together. I resumedtalking, then in another few minutes a hotel security guy came in with thevictim and started looking around, etc. I was reluctant to speculate that maybeone of the wall-moving guys had somehow grabbed the purse. One doesn’t want toautomatically blame the help, and moreover, the guys had on just shirts andpants, no jackets or anything, and they hadn’t been carrying any kind ofequipment bag that could have easily hidden the purse.I kept talking in spite of the minor hubbub still going onwith the security fellow. My audience nicely stuck with me and overlooked it whenI lost my place a couple of times.After another minute, someone sitting close to the daisspoke up and pointed: “I wonder if it could be in that wall!” Meaning thecompartment where the partition panels had been folded away.I thought that was a brilliant possibility, because thevictim had been sitting near the partition. A couple of attendees took theinitiative to open the compartment and root around in it, and lo and beholdcame the shout, “Here it is!” The purse had gotten somehow swept up in thepartition as the guys accordioned it away. (Thank you for speaking up, RPLA winner Melody!Later I learned others had had the same thought, but hadn’t called it out yet.)Happy ending, though I had to hotfoot it over the last partsof my presentation to try to make up for the lost time.Afterward, the woman stopped me in the concourse andapologized, saying, “I’m the drama queen who disrupted your presentation.” Ofcourse I told her never mind, these things happen.In the aftermath, a few conversations got going around the assumptionthat the purse had been stolen, which—hey, it seemed like a reasonable conclusion.After all, I was standing there at the lectern thinking of the likeliestsuspects: the hotel employees, who had come in and out so quickly. Who werethey? Where were they now? And yet—and yet! A freakish, unintended event hadcome between the woman and her purse; no one’s fault, a perfectly reasonableexplanation. Such a fantastic lesson in remaining calm and considering allpossibilities in the face of calamity! Any of the great detectives—fictional andreal—would have been proud!I’m still shaking my head over it.What do you think?

{"title": "Imperfect? Perfect!", "date": "Thursday, October 20, 2016", "text": "Zestful Blog Post #181Pre-blog note: I’ll be doing the Florida Writers Associationconference this weekend. Subtropical friends, I look forward to seeing you there!Please make a point of coming to my presentations and panel discussion, as theywill be the best.Today’s blog:Recently I read and posted reviews for a book that’s notperfect. It’s a first book. I gave it four stars, a very good rating, notbecause I thought the book had tons of literary merit, but because I thought itwas written from the heart. (And it does have literary merit.) I thought otherreaders might enjoy it and benefit from what the author had to say.The book is Forever Built of Days by Jessie Witt Pannell. It’s a memoir in the form of a pasticheof prose and poetry. Jessie is a good writer. The object lesson here, though,is this: She felt inspired to write a book about her life; she didn’t get hungup on following some form or other; she wrote the book; she put it out there. Thereare little things here and there I might wish she’d done differently, but overallthe book succeeds. It isn’t perfect, but it’s out there.[Is this window box perfect? It isn't! It is! Look at that lobelia!]This is something I saw over and over as a judge for Writer’sDigest self-published-book competitions. Those contestants got their books outinto the world. Most betrayed a lack of writing experience but by God thosebooks had gotten written, finished, and offered.I’m not advocating careless work. I’m advocating giving ityour best shot, then moving forward with a peaceful heart. This is something Imust remind myself of all the time. So I figured I’d get in your face about ittoday too!

{"title": "The Key to Book Retail", "date": "Thursday, October 13, 2016", "text": "Zestful Blog Post #180Quick pre-blog note: The current Writer’s Digest Yearbook onthe newsstands features a couple of articles by me: “Take Two,” on using arcand pace to fix and improve your storytelling, and an excerpt on how to writegood dialogue from You’ve Got a Book inYou.On to today’s post. Ever since ending my 10-year career withBorders in 1997 I’ve kept an eye on the bookselling business. I learned a lot workingfor Tom and Louis Borders, and some of it was about retail in general. And the greattruth of retail is that there is no such thing as a loyal customer. The instanta customer decides their needs will be served better elsewhere, sayonara. That’slife; that’s common sense.Therefore, the key to retail success is to be a loyal merchant. You can and should be loyal toyour customers by serving them well, truly, and consistently. But there’s more.A relic!Today, bricks-and-mortar retail is way more about experiencethan the merchandise. Doesn’t that sound odd? But it’s so. The retail discountexperience isn’t a pleasant experience; it’s usually an ordeal. We endure theharsh lighting, cheap fixtures, and overwhelming layouts in order to saveserious dollars on food and other stuff. Then of course we can buy all kinds ofthings for low prices on line, from the comfort of our cracker-strewn bed. Wecan buy books that way too. Therefore, why bother getting up, taking a shower, puttingon clothes, and scrounging enough gas money to go to a bookstore to browse andbuy?For the experience. For a unique experience, which in thecase of a bookstore means a curated collection. Smart booksellers know that thedeep-and-wide inventory of B&N or the late Borders will cost them big totry to duplicate, and make for lower profit margins. But if a bookseller canstart small—that is, 4,000 to 8,000 titles—and curate that collection deep andnarrow, they can succeed. Because the store’s personality is what attractscustomers, if they’re to be attracted. Lots of smart booksellers are doing thesmall-batch, microbrew experience. (Speaking of microbrews, it is indeed a factthat food and beverage make any shopping or entertainment experience moreenjoyable.)Still, what’s to stop a customer from finding a cool book atyour store, then buying it via their phone right while they’re standing there,for cheaper, on line? Nothing. Some will always do that.But booksellers who keep an eye on expenses, make reasonablechoices when it comes to staffing and overhead, and work hard to make it easyfor a customer to buy something right now—yeah, that can work. Because humanscrave experience; we WANT to get out of our cracker-strewn bed and feel we’vedone something fun and worthwhile. We want to brag that we went to X store,where the cognoscenti go. But moreover, it’s the serendipity of browsing thatmakes it worthwhile to physically be in a place with lots of books. You’re gonnasee something new; you’re gonna bump into something or even someone. You’regonna have a different feeling than staring into that glowing screen with itstiny images and hyperdrive scrolling. Even Amazon knows that, and iscapitalizing on it: their new brick-and-mortar stores must be doing well, asthey’re rolling out more of them.Then there’s innovation! Went to the movies on a trip tosuburban Detroit not long ago, and it was the first time I saw the ticket lineand the concession line be one and the same. Lots of staff behind the counter;the line went fast; they sold a sh*t-ton of popcorn and everything, way morethan if the lines were separate. This is really, really a leap, and how couldit have taken so long for the first theater operator to a) get the idea, and b)have the balls to implement it?What’ll be the next innovative thing in book retail? Lots ofsmart people are working on that.What do you think?

{"title": "Solving the Writer's Conundrum", "date": "Thursday, October 6, 2016", "text": "Zestful Blog Post #179I was supposed to teach ‘How to Write a Dynamite Mystery orThriller that SELLS’ at the Mystery Writers of America event this Saturday inVenice, Fla., ‘Sleuthfest on Saturday.’ But that confab has been cancelledbecause of the incoming Hurricane Matthew. According to the organizer, my buddyRandy Rawls, many presenters and attendees were coming from the Atlantic coastof the state, and they need to take care of the home front. Here on the Gulfcoast we’re looking to miss the worst of it; keeping fingers crossed for all ofour friends in harm’s way. Marcia, ever practical, objected, “Heck, they alreadyhad hotel reservations here where it’s safe!” I’m hoping we can put this eventtogether again; will keep you posted.OK. I promised to write more about the stuff I learned atthe recent Novelists, Inc. conference. Here’s something that’s preyed on mymind, to a head-banging extent: Should authors write the story they want towrite, or write the story they think—maybe even know—readers want?[...Doesn’t look too bad at the moment...]Liz Pelletier, CEO and president of Entangled Publishing,gave a compelling talk on how to test-market book ideas before writing a book,to better ensure commercial success. (This whole thing really has to do withcommercial success, an important point to remember.) Until recently—until socialmedia came along, that is—you couldn’ttest-market an idea for a novel. Well, you could, but it would have beencomplicated and probably expensive. Besides, didn’t agents and editors in NewYork know what’s best?But now you can put out a single idea, or a paragraph ofhypothetical back-cover material, to your friends and followers, and ask forreactions. You can tweak it and see what they think now. If you’re comfortablewriting detailed outlines, you can go farther still, and test it again. Liz andher company have done these things, and in a few years they’ve put more than 50books on the NYT bestsellers list. This is beyond impressive.In an opposite sort of talk, equally compelling, JulianPavia, an executive editor at Random House/Crown, told the tale of two debutnovels, both of which had been projects of passion: The Martian by Andy Weirand Ready Player One by Ernest Cline. Both guys basically were like, “Screw it—I’mgonna write the thing that’s been burning a hole in my heartbrain.” Both booksbecame blockbuster bestsellers, movie deals, dollars spurting like arterialblood, because readers responded to them and spread the word. Neither guy hadwritten a novel before; Weir was in tech and Cline was a screenwriter. Ofcourse their experience and skills served them well when they did set out towrite a novel.Commercial success means you have a readership. Every authorwants their books to find an audience. But the desire to write—that first sparkof simply wanting to do it, having to do it—comes from deep down. That’s thekey: It all starts with passion. So it follows that a professional author must—must—writethe projects of the heart as well as be a journeyman. This requires planningand intentionality. It’s way easier to give in to faster-hotter-more than to insist on slow-cooked quality. I say, if you’re compelled to write fiction, look to yourheartbrain first. Mine what’s there first. And then you’ll be better equippedto write for the market. Your insides will be cleaner and clearer. You’ll behappier. It might take longer. That’s what I think.What do you think?

{"title": "Five Things I Learned at Novelists, Inc.", "date": "Thursday, September 29, 2016", "text": "Zestful Blog Post #178So I joined Novelists, Inc. this year, which is aprofessional organization for authors. The vast majority of members are female;I learned that the organization started as a splinter group from RomanceWriters of America. Last week I attended the annual conference, in St. PeteBeach (which is the real name of the town, separate from St. Petersburg.) (Unpaidplug for the Tradewinds resort hotel: If you’re looking for a place to have a midsizedconference (200-300 people), you can’t go wrong there. Great layout &staff, many conveniences, & a terrific beach on the Gulf.)Met some nice and very accomplished folks. There were someheavy hitters in the presenters ranks—like bosses from Amazon, BookBub, Nook, Ingram,and top publishers. I felt the long weekend was worthwhile; attended sessions and tooknotes like mad. Learned a ton of stuff, & will probably blog in greaterdepth on some of it. Key takeaways:Lots of people in the writing/publishing business believequality is the way to go; without great story, all the marketing in the world—whetheryou’re a trad- or self-published author—won’t help you achieve material success.Way more people in the business are convinced that marketingis the path to material success, as long as you keep pumping out titles.There are lots of dumpy-looking, middle-aged women in thisworld who make six figures writing genre fiction, mostly romance, mystery, andparanormal mutations of same. (Me, I have the dumpy-looking, middle-aged parts covered;the only missing part is the six figures.) Every man I met at the conferencewho was not a presenter was a husband-assistant. Really.[But we’re all swans deep down, aren’t we?]Authors whose books are not in the Kindle Select program(meaning exclusively with Amazon) are angry with Amazon that they don’t get thesame deals and advantages that Kindle Select authors get. The two guys who werethere from Amazon did a great job escaping with their skins after theirpresentation.I spent lots of time going to marketing and promo sessions,but made time to go to some craft sessions as well, cuz craft is my thing. Onemajor takeaway for me was that readers like deep, deep point of view. SometimesI’ve wondered how detailed to make my characters’ thoughts; I like writing deep,but sometimes have pulled back, fearing the reader might be skipping this stuff.But after listening to a few editors who have worked with blockbuster bestsellers,I’m like, yeah! Deep POV is fun to write, and moreover, it develops yourcharacters as nothing else does.Example of deep POV? Which is better?:The next day, I felt uneasy.A rancid haze settled over me the next day, which wasThursday. It was as if the whole city had turned poisonous—as if micro-bubblesof toxin were raining down on the city, green in color, the exact chartreuse ofthe mittens of the tiny bully in my first-grade class who had used them to mashsnow into my dumb pretty little face that winter, over and over. When the snowmelted, she used mud. [from The Actress]And OK, here is one more takeaway, which makes six instead of five, but whatever: It's great to be an attendee. You can wear sneakers and pants and t-shirts and sit in the back and not have to worry about how white your teeth are or whether your lip gloss is still good. I realized that until this one, I've been a presenter at every conference I've ever been to as a published author. It costs more to be an attendee, but God is it great to wear sneakers and t-shirts every day.What do you think?

{"title": "Close Reading 3", "date": "Wednesday, September 21, 2016", "text": "Zestful Blog Post #177Welcome to the third installment of Close Reading, where I analyzeexamples of published writing and discuss how and why they work or don’t.I’m a come-lately reader to Jim Harrison, author of thenovella Legends of the Fall (made into a big movie with Brad Pitt in 1994), thehighly praised novels Sundog and Dalva, and numerous other fiction andcollections of poetry. He also wrote journalism and occasional pieces forvarious magazines. Jim died this year, and I’ve been thinking about him, havingmet him a few times, twenty-plus years ago. (I ran a bookstore where he did acouple of signings, and a friend of mine became his assistant in Montana.) Inever read his work because I didn’t like him personally, which was probablyunfair, and because he wrote stuff about how horrible Hollywood was AFTER he’dmade his two million dollars there, but whatever. Not long ago I came across acollection of his nonfiction called Just Before Dark in a used-bookstore anddecided to give him a try.I have an acute sense of when an author’s being pretentious,and I saw a few instances of that in this collection, such as here, from anarticle about fly fishing (“Guiding Light in the Keys”), originally publishedin Sports Illustrated. The passage describes a professional fishing guide:[excerpt begins]At home in the evenings, Sexton exercises his castingarm—which looks like an oak club—by going through all the motions with atwelve-pound sledgehammer with a foreshortened handle.[excerpt ends]While the arm looking like an oak club is great, thepretentious part is ‘foreshortened.’ The hammer’s handle was shortened.Foreshortened is an art term, and perhaps because of that it sounds moreintellectual than simply shortened. So I mark Harrison—and whoever his editorat Sports Illustrated was—down for that. Do not do shit like that in yourwriting.However, one should not throw a one-eyed,two-hundred-fifty-pound baby out with the bathwater, so here is a passagefrom another piece. This one, I think, is wonderful. It’s a complete paragraph from an articlecalled “Don’t Fence Me In,” originally published by Conde Nast Traveler. Thearticle is about taking automobile trips for the hell of it.[excerpt begins]This sort of driving can be a fabulous restorative. Unlikein an airplane, you can stop, turn right or left, on a whim. Driving intoemptiness keeps you at least a few miles ahead of your neuroses, and by thetime they catch up to you when you bed down in the evening, you are too tiredto pay any attention to them. This past year I had a great deal of leisure time,so I drove 42,000 miles around the United States, avoiding the interstateswhenever possible. Driving offers peace solitude, inaccessibility, and thefreedom and adventure that allow me to think up new novels and rest from thelast one. Your whimsicality returns; you’ve already driven to Arizona—why notcontinue on down to San Carlos, Mexico and hike out the Seri Indian territoryon the coast of the Sea of Cortes? And there, camped out on a mountain ridgeunder a glorious full moon, you throw the wrong kind of porous log on the fireand then dance a new tune as a dozen angry scorpions shoot out, a fresh brandof reality pudding. The trip was a mere seven thousand miles but without asingle moment of boredom, the brain once again rippling like a smoothunderground river.[excerpt ends]The first cool thing about this paragraph is the “few milesahead of your neuroses,” which is frank and blunt, and because of that, bleaklyfunny. A dull mind would not think of putting it that way, so as a reader, youcan relax and know you’re likely to get some more good stuff.[Cover of Just Before Dark; artwork by Russell Chatham, whowas a friend of Harrison’s. A Chatham lithograph hangs in the background on myoffice wall. (Another story.)]Apart from the mildly interesting fact that Harrison canthink better while moving along in a car, we also get the exotic mention ofMexico and an impromptu hike. Then the passionate bit about the mountain ridgeand the moon, and you think that’s nice but is he about to turn purple on me?,but no, he gives you the mistake, the log, the scorpions, the dance, and youcan laugh because he certainly expects you to. And again, the moment is funnierbecause it comes after this serious stuff about the awesome beauty of the world.Juxtaposition can be your friend.Technical note on first and second person here. You’llnotice that the writer skips around from second person “…you can stop, turn…”to first “I had a great deal of leisure time…” and back to second again “Yourwhimsicality returns…” and it works. Why? Because this is an informal piece,not a term paper, and shifting from first to second person is conversational.Most people do it all the time while talking, not really aware of making anygrammatical shifts at all. And it sounds fine; it sounds real. I encourage youto experiment with this in your own writing.The closing image of the “brain once again rippling like asmooth underground river” is just topping, isn’t it? Power, ease, movement—allof that is suggested. And because of the “once again,” we understand thatsomething lost has been regained. The attentive reader goes home happy.Final note: This is just one paragraph in the middle of along essay of thousands of words. Yet the graph has a structure of its own.Study it over again: There’s a beginning that serves as an introduction, alittle story in the middle, and a very satisfying ending. Not every graphHarrison wrote was structured this way, and that’s OK, of course; not everygraph he ever wrote is that perfect, and that’s OK too.What do you think?

{"title": "Solid Tips: Grabbing a Live Audience", "date": "Thursday, September 15, 2016", "text": "Zestful Blog Post #176Hi! Yes, vacation was great; gorgeous vistas and happy times with old friends; more or less relevant snapshotto follow.I’ve never been an audio-books person, preferring to listento music in the car, or while exercising or doing chores. Just habit. But whenmy Lillian Byrd novels got produced by Audible this year, of course I had tostart listening.The narrator, Dina Pearlman, and I had a phone meeting beforeshe got to work, which went well. I felt good about her voice and personality.Next I recorded for her a series of names, place names, and any idiosyncraticwords and pronunciations that I thought would help her sound authentic.Then she got to work, and a few months later the recordingswere done. As I started listening to the first in the series, Holy Hell, I wasstruck forcefully by Dina’s competence as a vocal actress. I know mostprofessional narrators can make just about any prose sound way better than anuntrained person can, but I’d never paid all that much attention before.Having done a tiny bit of acting in community theater and as a host forcorporate audios and videos, I knew basics like don’t talk too fast, and keepyour gestures smooth.But I’d never noticed so much about the technique of goodreading until listening closely to Dina reading fiction I’d written. I keptthinking wow, yeah, I wouldn’t have thought to do that like this, or this likethat. All this in spite of the fact that I’d read my own work aloud toaudiences countless times.[The most awesome thing about this glacier (theDawes in Alaska) was its sound. As the thing moves, it gives off sudden hugebooms and cracks, like artillery and rifle shots. Never knew about that before.Never had an opportunity to listen to that before.]Knowing that I had a reading coming up at the RinglingCollege, I decided to try to fix a few things in my mind, practice them, andexecute them at my reading. For your benefit, here they are:- Go way slower, overall, than you think you should.- Don’t rush the first couple of words in sentences, whichmost nonprofessionals tend to do. This alone will transform your reading-aloudperformance.- When an abrupt change happens, such as an interruption, stopcold at the em dash before going on, unhurriedly, to the next words. Like here:            “So I thinkwe should have a meal before we—”            A shot rangout. [Do a real pause after that em dash.]- Vary your cadence. Here’s the great benefit of keeping yourordinary cadence, or pace, fairly slow and deliberate: You can shift gears!When you shift up to a faster cadence, as Dina subtly but hilariously did whenLillian describes her stove-cleaning routine, you catch hold of the listener’sattention and bring their heart rate up a little bit. Then when you downshift,they keep paying attention.- Take care to enunciate. If the word is important enough tobe there, well by gosh give it its due. Pay attention especially to the ends ofwords, which tend to get swallowed in everyday speech. For instance, that lastword, speech, should almost sound like a syllable and a half: spee-ch. See whatI mean?- Vary your tone, of course. This is especially helpful inpassages of dialogue, to help make clear who’s talking. Dina was able toproduce a wide variety of tones and vocal styles for different characters. For the rest of us, simply raising or lowering your pitch a little bit between characters will work.When I gave my reading at the college, I put most of thosethings into practice. Tried to read as if I were making a recording, which I actuallywas; the film students were making a video of my gig. It was like magic, I swearto you. I read chapter one of The Extra, which concerns Rita Farmer in policecostume during a movie shoot. (She wanders off set and gets drawn into a realcrime scene.) The audience was a nice group to begin with—a mix of students,faculty, and members of the public—but man, they really enjoyed that reading. Itell you this not to boast of the material, but of my new and improved delivery. I’ve hadaudiences like my readings before, but never to this extent. They chuckled,gasped, murmured in alarm—everything you could want. I couldn’t believe how wellthose techniques worked.So: TL;DR: Listen to a professional, then do like they do.Have you an interesting experience reading aloud?

{"title": "The Value of Looking Like an Idiot", "date": "Thursday, August 25, 2016", "text": "Zestful Blog Post #175Quick note: I’ll be skipping the next two Thursdays, doingsome vacay. Our 250-pound housesitter and his two pit bulls will be keepingthings nice and safe while we’re away.OK, today’s post.A writer turned to me for counsel recently, saying that he waskind of frightened to plunge into the book he wanted to write, because, well,maybe it won’t be any good and he’ll look like an idiot.You can imagine my reaction.The whole point of life, let alone writing, is to be OK withlooking like an idiot. For three reasons:One, nobody gets it perfect the first time;Two, only if you risk idiocy will you have a shot at success; andThree, so many people don’t even try, that you’llstand out if you do.As it happens, I’ve been making myself look like an idiot alot at the YMCA pool where I swim. After learning a decent freestyle stroke, I’dbeen wanting to learn the flip turn. You know, where you swim up to the wall,curl-tuck-flip, and push off from the wall underwater. It’s smooth, it’s hardto do right, and it looks totally badass.Every fitness swimmer wishes they could do a flip turn. Butbecause it takes all this flailing and failing and sinuses full of stingingchlorine water while you learn (while everybody else keeps swimming calmly alongin the adjoining lanes, checking out your progress with furtive glances), few makethe effort. Every public pool is full of fitness swimmers who swim regularlyfor decades, stopping at every wall, turning around, and pushing off again.But of course I’m like, what’s life for but challenges? Formonths I tried to achieve the basic, crux move, the underwater somersault, butjust couldn’t get all the way around. As soon as my head pointed at the bottom Ifreaked out and had to go back the way I came. Finally I approached one of theswim instructors and offered her any amount of money to teach me the flip turn.Susan smiled and was like, You really want to do this? No charge, baby.In fifteen minutes she had me doing the somersault with theassistance of a foam noodle, then a couple of foam blocks in my hands. Over thecourse of weeks, I practiced and practiced, and with Susan’s occasional guidancegradually started to put together the rest of the turn, which looks so smoothand fast but is actually a series of precision moves and micro-decisions allalong the way.You have to be OK with scraping your shoulder on the bottom,with ramming your butt into the wall by mistake, with running out of air, withflailing to the surface and gasping like a trout. I’ve heard that little kids canlearn this much faster than adults, which is no surprise, because they haven’t hadenough life experience to obsess about looking like an idiot.Once I succeeded in the somersault, there was no way I wasgoing to give up. And son of a bitch if I haven’t more or less gotten the hangof it. I don’t look like Katie Ledecky—my arms still aren’t well streamlined asI’m pushing off, and sometimes my air doesn’t last through the whole pushoffand I get a little water in my nose—but hell, I feel great. I know I’ll keepgetting better at it. I swagger back to the showers like I just won gold.And that’s the point of looking like an idiot.What do you think?

One gets the feeling each one serves a purpose.]Here’s one of my favorite parts of the article, on how tomake even minor characters memorable:[excerpt begins:]It’s easy to hotfoot it over a minorcharacter, or person, whether in fiction or narrative nonfiction. But if thecharacter is important enough to exist in the world of your story, let yourreaders picture that existence.Pick a detail, anydetail.How would you describe the last guy who bagged yourgroceries? Did you see him? Whatabout the friend of a friend you met the other night? Or the baby held by thedistant cousin who showed up at that family funeral?Being observant in your own life helps when the time comesto characterize someone.

{"title": "Dog Days Blog Chat", "date": "Thursday, August 11, 2016", "text": "Zestful Blog Post #173The few times a year I send out full-on Newschats, I alwaysmake them my blog for that week. As always, apologies for the double if you’resubscribed both there and here. If you’re one of my blog friends, you’ve beenthe first to see some of these announcements and links below—but not all! Got afreebie going, and other new stuff. Thanks for skimming down. Oh, and to join mynews group, pop over here.Dog Days Newschat begins:Dearest Correspondent,The dog days are upon us—that is, the hottest part of theyear (in the northern hemi): when Sirius, or the Dog Star, positions itselfbehind the sun in the summer sky. The star doesn’t make it extra hot—weremember that correlation does not necessarily equal causation—but psychologically,I think there’s something there.Anyway, a dog days giveaway is at the top of my newschattoday!The second in theRita Farmer series, The Extra,is free on Amazon Kindle right now, through the weekend. The Extra opens with Rita in police costume on a movie shoot nearthe Los Angeles river. She wanders away from the set to find something betterto eat than the roachy sandwiches the low-budget production company provides,and winds up getting taken for a real cop and drawn into a real crime scene.The ensuing mystery concerns a runaway show beagle (so, like yeah, dog days),an inner-city charity mission with major secrets, and a creepy old crone up inBakersfield. Nab yourself one!All five Lillian Byrdcrime novels are now available on Audible Books! They all have individuallinks, but here’s the one for Holy Hell to get you going. The narrator, DinaPearlman, did a fabulous job. Here’s a little something about her:“Dina Pearlman was born in New Jersey and raised in the fairhamlet of Teaneck, home of the Isley Brothers. After 4 years at Carnegie MellonUniversity, she came to New York to pursue acting professionally. Shelanguished in sorrow and Fritos for a year and half, enduring a steady streamof rejection, broken occasionally by an appearance in a sparsely attendedshowcase production of an obscure play, somewhere obscure. One day, afterhaving received a particularly painful rejection, she decided to get up off hertuchis and head down to Gladys' Comedy Room to try her hand at stand-up comedy.She wrote her act on the 2nd avenue bus whilst travelling between 81st and 53rdstreets, had two gin and tonics, got up on the stage, and killed. She then decidedthat while acting would always be her first love, stand-up was a way to get herperforming jones out in the meantime. Shortly thereafter, she landed a sketchcomedy pilot on ABC, followed by some regional theater, followed by a Spike Leemovie, followed by more theater and TV, and so it went. Somehow or another,this ol' goofus from New Jersey had herself an acting career.”Dina especially gets the humor of Lillian right: She doesn’tham it up, and you have to be a good sharp listener yourself to get it.New novel? Crimes ina Second Language? Yes, I’ve dangled it before you, but where the hell isit? Short answer: I’m dicking around with it. Do stay tuned.Meanwhile, a newshort story! Sarasota’s SCENE magazine has just published my newest inits August issue. “Go-Go Day” is about a woman past her prime, her dangerousbackyard, and the perils of an unexamined life. You can read it for freeonline. Page 83.Writer’s Digest Bookshonored me by including four chapters by me in their latest book on writing, Crafting Dynamic Dialogue: The Complete Guide to Speaking, Conversing, Arguing, and Thinking in Fiction. Othertop writing authors in the book: Jeff Gerke, James Scott Bell, and GloriaKempton.Speaking of Writer’sDigest, check out a couple of issues on the newsstand now: The September issue includes my feature on getting the little stuff right in fiction (“It’sthe Little Things.”) Because little stuff, if it’s good, can mean a lot! Also,see my piece “Revise Like a Pro” in WD’s current Novel Writing Yearbook. Thatwas an especially fun one, because I excerpted before-and-after material frommy own novels.I might add, I’ll have articles in the upcoming January andFebruary issues of the magazine as well.To hear me talk aboutmy career, check out this recent radio interview with Bradenton’s ownDona Lee Gould on RadioEar network. Dona Lee’s skillful editing makes me soundso much less muddled than in real life…The rumor is truethat I’m not taking on any new coaching/editing clients. I love the work, butit was just taking up too much of my time. I have some new initiatives that Ihope will help me help more writers than working one-on-one. I’ll be focusing alot more on new writing, as well.Upcoming appearances:I’ll be kicking off this year’s Visiting Writers Forum atthe Ringling College of Art and Design in Sarasota at 7 p.m. on August 23. Theevent is open to all, and I’m pretty sure it’s free. I’ll read a little bit,discuss the craft of writing, and do Q&A. Information as to venue andparking will be posted on my blog when I get it.And hey, consider joining me at the following upcomingconferences, where I’ll be a presenter:Sleuthfest on Saturday, put on by the Florida chapter of MysteryWriters of America on October 8.Florida Writers Association annual conference, October 20-23.I’ve joinedNovelists, Inc., a selective organization of serious authors. I’ll beattending the upcoming annual conference next month in St. Petersburg, Fla. andwill report about it in my blog.Zestful Writing,speaking of blogs, continues to cook along, my once-a-week, idiosyncraticposting of my best ideas on writing and my experiences as a writer and learner.A couple of weeks ago it popped up as #94 on Feedspot’s top 100 writing blogs.OK, that’s more than enough for now!Love,ElizabethWhat do you think?

{"title": "Simply Mine and Yours", "date": "Thursday, August 4, 2016", "text": "Zestful Blog Post #172The other day I was surprised to see that Zestful Writing inched into Feedspot’s list of top 100 writing blogs. The list usesweb metrics rather than somebody’s subjective judgment to rank the blogs. Itgets updated once a week. (At the moment, Zestful Writing is #94.) Feedspot is essentiallyan RSS aggregator.I was surprised because my subscriber base numbers in thehundreds, not the thousands (though the blog gets more visits fromnonsubscribers), I have relatively few Twitter followers, and this blog doesn’thave its own Facebook page.Moreover, I’m a little surprised my blog gets much attentionat all, because I don’t do two key things bloggers these days are supposed todo for health, wealth, and ever more subscribers:1)     Haveguest bloggers write posts, and2)     Repurposeother people’s material by quoting from their articles, books, and blog posts.Oh, and as far as writers’ blogs go, I also avoid focusingon how to make money from your writing. This is a huge difference between meand many others.I’ve been asked to guest post here and there, and havealways said yes. And my writing has been excerpted in other blogs, and I’m finewith that, when proper credit is given, of course. Was downright honored tohave some of my stuff excerpted in a high profile writing blog recently.But Zestful Writing is an old-style blog. Isn’t it insane toeven use the word old when speaking of a blog? But yeah, to me, your web log,or blog, is supposed to be written by you, not other people. It’s supposed tobe your take on things, your reportage of your activities vis-à-vis your subject.I’m missing out on the networky advantages that come to you when you vigorouslyexchange guest posts with other bloggers and when you aggregate other people’smaterial. So be it. Exposure, publicity, marketing! So be it.[Graffiti on a stall wall in the women's room at John King Books in Detroit this year.]I always lose interest when a blogger I’ve been followingstarts publishing guest posts. Because I want to learn about THAT person, nothis friends. HER ideas, not her friends’. Is it nitpicky for me to say, “Well,then, don’t call it a blog, call it a newsletter.”?This blog is idiosyncratic. It’s mine, and I alone write itfor you. I write about my best ideas on how to write well and freely—with zest.I write about stuff that interests me as a writer and reader, I write about mylife as a writer, and I especially like to write about stuff I learn—and how thatrelates to living the life of a zestful writer. Also, I almost always use my own photographs/images to illustratethis blog.When I post things about my blog on my personal Facebook page (which is also my author and blogger Facebook page (come friend me)), I usually putup an excerpt from it and a reference to the blog. But not a link to the blog,because FB puts links lower in the feed, and I want to share my material, notnecessarily get you to click through to the blog at all costs.If you like reading this blog, you’re my friend.

{"title": "Close Reading 2", "date": "Thursday, July 28, 2016", "text": "Zestful Blog Post #171Welcome to the second installment of Close Reading!I’m writing an article for Writer’s Digest magazine aboutpivot points in story development. While skimming around my bookshelves forexamples last night, I found myself absorbed in rereading passages from JamesM. Cain’s novel Double Indemnity (firstpublished serially in Libertymagazine in 1936). Now, the passage I’ll quote below is not an example of apivot point. I’ll discuss those in a future post, after the article is in thecan. But this passage just grabbed me, and I want to show it to you and talkabout it. If you haven’t read the book (or seen the excellent movie, 1944), theprotagonist is an insurance salesman, and he’s just entered into a plot with awoman to kill her husband, share the insurance payout, and live happily everafter.[begin quote]All right, I’m an agent. I’m a croupier in that game. I knowall their tricks, I lie awake nights thinking up tricks, so I’ll be ready forthem when they come at me. And then one night I think up a trick, and get tothinking I could crook the wheel myself if I could only put a plant out thereto put down my bet. That’s all. When I met Phyllis I met my plant. If thatseems funny to you, that I would kill a man just to pick up a stack of chips,it might not seem so funny if you were back of that wheel, instead of outfront. I had seen so many houses burned down, so many cars wrecked, so manycorpses with blue holes in their temples, so many awful things that people hadpulled to crook the wheel, that that stuff didn’t seem real to me any more. If youdon’t understand that, go to Monte Carlo or some other place where there’s abig casino, sit at a table, and watch the face of the man that spins the littleivory ball. After you’ve watched it a while, ask yourself how much he wouldcare if you went out and plugged yourself in the head. His eyes might drop whenhe heard the shot, but it wouldn’t be from worry whether you lived or died. It wouldbe to make sure you didn’t leave a bet on the table, that he would have to cashfor your estate. No, he wouldn’t care. Not that baby.[end quote]That is a single paragraph, and it ends chapter 2 (of 14). Thisbrilliant graph is an example of powerful narrative, and of strong character voice.Of particular interest to me is Cain’s choice of the word [that]instead of [who] in this instance: ‘…watch the face of the man that spins thelittle ivory ball.’ Of course [who] would be correct. We are talking about aman, not a thing. If you were writing a term paper or literary essay, you wouldnaturally write: [the quicksand that swallowed the hunter], but you wouldn’tnecessarily write [the hunter that fell into the quicksand]. No, you’d write[the hunter who fell into the quicksand]. But Cain wrote the book in thefirst-person voice of his main character, Walter Huff (changed to Neff in themovie). And he shows us here, very quickly and subtly, that Huff is a smart manwithout much formal education. A guy who doesn’t care a lot about niceties.What else does the reader learn in this passage? We learn fromHuff that he sees life as a game—a deadly serious one, but a game just thesame. We learn that he’s thought about committing insurance fraud for a longtime, and he describes how that came to be: First he was doing his job, tryingto think of scams to stay ahead of the crooks who kept trying to cheat hisemployer. To stymie crooks, it helps to think like a crook. Then, the progressionkept going, almost-sorta-kinda naturally: He started to imagine himself being acrook—a successful one, not a loser, given what he knows from the inside. Butthat was just a fantasy at first, the kind of fantasy practically everybody canrelate to. Then, however, the fantasy took hold and became a more realistictheory. Then, the right circumstances presented themselves, and now he’s got a solidplan that involves murder.The way Cain constructed the graph is partly responsible forits impact. Huff drones on in the first few lines, then hits us with […that I wouldkill a man just to pick up a stack of chips…] which practically serves as abullet itself. Then we get to […so many corpses with blue holes in theirtemples…] The starkness of that, the blunt, cold frankness, all told in thesame steady cadence!And we learn how Huff rationalizes the evil he’s about to commit.He hasn’t got a soul, not anymore, he tries to explain; he’s seen so much evilhe’s jaded. And then Huff paints a picture of the roulette croupier, he tells alittle hypothetical story, and it’s so real even we hear the gunshot when itcomes.If there’s a paragraph in all of literature that portraysself-interested cynicism better, while at the same time ingratiating thecharacter with the reader by appealing to the reader's logic and intelligence—I don’t know of it. The reader is meant to identifywith Huff, and we do, we pull for him, because we appreciate his rawintelligence, his ambition, his drive to do a complicated, dangerous jobproperly. Elsewhere in the story we’re invited to dislike Phyllis’s husband andto fear Phyllis’s treacherousness. We hope Huff won’t come out of this toobadly. This is the embodiment of noir fiction: The story of someone who commitsevil and with whom we empathize.What do you think?

{"title": "Spare No One", "date": "Thursday, July 21, 2016", "text": "Zestful Blog Post #170Today’s post, about easy ways to make minor charactersmemorable, follows this raft of announcements.Am happy to report that Lesbians on the Loose: Crime Writers on the Lam, published by Launch Point Press and edited by my goodbuddies Lori L. Lake and Jessie Chandler, won a Goldie award at the recent GCLSconference. My story, “Untold Riches,” leads off the collection, which comprises15 stories by lezfic luminaries including living legend and all-around coolperson Katherine V.

It's an installation of bottles of dyes used in photography, in olden times when everything was printed on paper. Many items. For the heck of it.]OK, so now here’s my post for today. It’s from (well, Iguess here’s another goddam announcement) the September issue of Writer’s Digestmagazine, on newsstands now. I wrote an article for them called, “It’s theLittle Things,” and here’s what I had to say about making even minor charactersmemorable:[Excerpt begins:] It’s easy tohotfoot it over a minor character, whether in fiction or nonfiction. But if theperson is important enough to exist in the world of your story, let yourreaders picture that existence.-       Pick a detail, any detail.How would you describe the guy who bagged your groceriesyesterday? Did you see him? Whatabout the friend of a friend you met the other night? Or the baby held by thedistant cousin who showed up at that family funeral?Being observant in your own life helps when you need to comeup with a detail to characterize someone. For a minor character, select justabout anything, as long as you use something.The knock-kneed cheerleader pointed and screamed.-       Better still, pick two details.The boss’s wife smelled like Jack Daniel’s and drove a redFerrari.Timmy’s chin quivered, but he gripped his bear tightly andkept quiet.Even a character who appears only in passing should exist inthe reader’s eye. For a super minor character, pick out just one detail. For aliterally glancing description, make it visual.

{"title": "A Story Like No Other", "date": "Thursday, July 14, 2016", "text": "Zestful Blog Post #169I hope the title of this post made you do a double-take,because of course every story is like no other; every story is unique to someextent. Not every story in the world, to be sure, is terribly interesting oreven worthwhile, which is the point. If you’re a friend of mine on Facebook—or Facefriends,as my brother, who does not have an account there, gamely refers to it—you might have seenmy post the other day about my YMCA buddy Chuck. I’ve copied the post below,after the picture.Of any post I’ve ever put up on FB, this one has receivedthe most likes, comments, and shares. I’m not terribly active on FB, so to methe following stats are remarkable: as of this writing, 197 likes, 29 comments,5 shares. I have 1,087 friends on FB, though almost all of my posts are publicand I think anybody can like, comment, or share. People have been moved totears by the post. It’s a story about a guy who got a tough break and who isworking his damnedest to overcome it.My point today is to reinforce simply this: People lovestories. People learn from stories. People get inspired by stories. People NEEDstories. If you tell a story from your heart, with love and truth, you willsucceed. What is success? It’s reaching readers, even one, with somethingmeaningful to them. If you are a storyteller, you are a core asset to thisworld. Tell it plain, tell it fancy. But tell it.Took this selfie yesterday whilechilling for a few minutes with Chuck in the snack room.FB post:So. Thisstory. Last year while lifeguarding part time at the local YMCA, I met a guynamed Chuck. Middle-aged, scrawny, disabled from a stroke. Used a base-linemanual wheelchair, shoved himself along mostly with one hand and one foot. Hadmuch trouble making himself understood, but I learned he'd been doing rehab formonths. I operated the lift to get him in and out of the pool, where heregularly, doggedly attended water exercise classes. Made a point of callinghim by name and cheering him on.Last summer, afew months after getting to know him, was driving past the bus stop near the Yand saw him sitting in his chair in the hot sun waiting for the bus. Thebastard was using THE BUS to get to and from his water exercise classes. Howmuch easier to just stay home and vegetate in front of the TV? How much easierto just say, \"I can't; (it's too much trouble).\" How much easier tosay, \"I don't have a helper; I can't.\" Solo, he was helping his owncrabbed-over, big-black-glasses-wearing, buck-toothed, determined ass.After mysix-month stint lifeguarding, which ended last December, I didn't see him asoften, but I did see him. Yesterday, when I was swimming my lengths, I saw himin the water exercise group and waved. Later, as I was leaving the building, Isaw him WALKING along the sidewalk outside. Using one arm-cane, big brace onhis leg, glasses held together with a walnut-sized wad of Scotch tape, slowly,slowly, he was walking on his two feet.Ran up tohim. \"Chuck! You're walking!\" He smiled and nodded, and that was ahell of a great moment. A hell of a great moment. A hell of a beautiful sight.[end of post]What do you think?

{"title": "Reverse Reading", "date": "Thursday, July 7, 2016", "text": "Zestful Blog Post #168Hi! I’m always so happy to see you. (I’ve never said thatbefore in this blog, but it’s true. Everyone who reads my blog is my friend, becauseI get about as intellectually intimate as it’s possible to get, here. As soonas I upload a post, I imagine you reading and thinking along with me.)The other day I wanted something to read that would bepleasantly stimulating but require no heavy lifting, so I cracked open my old SherlockHolmes collection at random and read “The Naval Treaty.” Reread it, actually,but it had been so long that I didn’t remember the plot. As all Holmes readersdo, I tried to guess the solution to the mystery. [Spoiler alert from here on;I’ll be discussing plot specifics.] I was fairly lazy about it, but one earlyhint stuck in my mind, and lo and behold, yep, the criminal turned out to bethe fiancée’s brother.Sometimes Sir Arthur Conan Doyle wrote stories with so fewclues for the reader that you have to just wait until Holmes tells you what hewas up to offscreen, so to speak. But this one actually revealed to the readerpretty much all the information Holmes was privy to. So I went back in one-pageincrements (roughly) from the end, noting specifically how Doyle constructedthe plot and planted clues.The setup: A trusted Foreign Office employee named Phelps isgiven the original of a pending naval treaty between Great Britain and Franceto copy over. In the midst of the job, he steps out of the room to get a cup ofcoffee, and the original is stolen. Phelps is in deep trouble, the Britishgovernment could be screwed if the treaty ‘should fall into the wronghands’ (love that trope), the police are stymied, and Phelps appeals to Holmesfor help.It would take many paragraphs to unpack and discuss all thecomplex facts and clues, including a nice red herring subplot involving theoffice charwoman, but here’s what grabbed my attention first: Holmes and Watsongo to the unfortunate official’s house in Woking and are welcomed by his futurebrother-in-law, a guy named Harrison. Holmes remarks that the man is not amember of the family; Harrison looks down and sees that Holmes must havenoticed his monogram, and says, “For a moment I thought you had done somethingclever.”A most generous hint from Doyle! One who belittles theskills of Holmes usually pays a price. Going back further, I saw that Harrisonwas placed in London the night of the theft; Phelps had planned to ride thelast train home to Woking together with him. Now that is an actual clue: afactual bit of business that twines into the plot. That thread is left lyingthrough most of the rest of the story, though Holmes, we learn at the end,picked it up and made use of it immediately.Then I read the story again from the beginning and noted allreferences to Harrison. Most were minor and offhanded, with the main sturm unddrang involving the charwoman. I noted Harrison’s behaviors and figured out thetimeline for him, and saw how Holmes would have zeroed in on him afterexcluding other possible thieves.So: For learning good plotting skills, repeated closereadings can be tremendously helpful. As a reader, you can pretty much figurethat the shouting and arm-waving are often a smokescreen; the train tickets andbedroom assignments can tell the real tale. As a writer, take the time to readclosely, reread if possible, and make notes, zeroing in on particular elementsthat catch your attention. Try reading out of sequence: backwards, as it were. Watching one key character all the way through astory can yield great insights. Short stories are wonderful for this, becauseyou don’t have to invest a ton of time to learn valuable stuff. I don’t readeverything so tremendously closely, but I do read slowly, and I like to rereadbooks and stories I consider excellent.What do you think?

{"title": "Inside Interior Dialogue", "date": "Thursday, June 30, 2016", "text": "Zestful Blog Post #167Before getting on to today’s post, here are a fewannouncements about new books by friends:Congratulations to BJ Phillips, whose first novel, Hurricane Season, is now out fromDesert Palm Press! That first one is always so special… We hear there’s more inthe pipeline from BJ. (See the book and more about her at her web site, linked to her name just above.)And it’s high time for a plug for my buddy and all-aroundgentleman (hey, those two things are not mutually exclusive) Neil Plakcy, whokeeps writing and publishing top-selling books in several genres. A slew of his new books are featured on the front page of his website. I admire Neil’s work ethic and prodigious output. He’s really arole model for me, and what’s more, he’s a fellow Floridian—as is BJ,coincidentally.I might add that both Neil and I will be at the Novelists,Inc. conference at St. Pete Beach later this year. We’ll be participants, notpresenters. Novelists, Inc., or NINC, is an association of professionalauthors who are committed to a) writing quality fiction and b) selling the hellout of it. I’lllet you know how that conference goes!Have I mentioned that I’ll be doing the Florida Writers Conference in Altamonte Springs this year? Sorry if this is arepeat, but they’ve put up much more information on their website now. I’ll bepresenting a couple of workshops, participating in a panel discussion, and willalso be available for individual conferences. They cost extra, but all themoney goes to FWA and its special programs for aspiring authors.Oh, and gosh, local friends alert! Join me at the SelbyLibrary in Sarasota (the main one with the pudgy white columns downtown) at 6p.m. this coming Tuesday, July 5. I’ll be doing “Looking for Trouble: DoingResearch for Fiction is not for Sissies.” More here. It’s free.OK, so the latest compendium from Writer’s Digest Books is freshly available, Crafting Dynamic Dialogue: The Complete Guide to Speaking, Conversing, Arguing, and Thinking in Fiction. It has four chapters by me, as well as multiple chapters from other WDstalwarts such as James Scott Bell, Jeff Gerke, and Gloria Kempton. And hey, gosh, the first reviewer on Amazon said this, in part: \"The two chapters on Dialogue and Suspense by James Scott Bell and Internal Dialogue by Elizabeth Sims, are worth twice the price of this fine volume.\"So, cool. Two of my chapters are excerpts from You’ve Got a Book in You, and a third is a reprint of one of myarticles for WD magazine. The fourth, “Understanding Internal Dialogue,” isoriginal to the book. The excellent Cris Freese, editor of the book, invited meto write something on internal dialogue, and I gladly took up the challenge.I see this post is already getting long, but I wanted toinclude an in-depth excerpt from the chapter, and here it is:[Excerpt begins]For both form and format, you can select something thatfeels right for you and your manuscript’s style and voice. Read closely todistinguish the differences in the six versions of this passage:Saturday night came, and stillSheila didn’t call. Marco sat at the window, drumming his fingers on the grittysill. He felt like robbing a liquor store. Would a knife be sufficient? Hedidn’t know. [Entire passage, including inner voice, is third person, pasttense.]Saturday night came, and stillSheila didn’t call. Marco sat at the window, drumming his fingers on the grittysill. I should hold up that liquor store tonight, I really should. Be somethingto do, anyway. I have my knife.

{"title": "How to Switch Gears Cleanly", "date": "Thursday, June 23, 2016", "text": "Zestful Blog Post #166This I know: Your life is a lot like mine. You have too muchstuff to do, too many projects on deck—work and personal—and half the time youfeel behind. I hate feeling behind, hate that mental fragmentation that happenswhen I try to do or think about multiple things at once. Probably like yours, lotsof my projects overlap, and I have to do parts of them, then wait to do otherparts until something else happens, or I have to set them aside because someother thing has risen in priority. It’s easy for me to overcommit. I like tosay yes to people and projects.But as I’ve written before, time is a zero-sum game. Eternityis eternal, but we all have a lifespan. I’ve been doing two things to save mysanity.The first is cutting back on my editing/consulting work. I’mlooking into other ways to help aspiring authors; stay tuned for more on that.Second, I’ve been doing a simple, but conscious, techniqueto help myself not feel mentally fragmented. When I’m not actively doing a task,or am switching between tasks, I try to blank out my brain. Which makes meaware of all the mental clutter that’s there! Then, with awareness, the cluttermore or less disappears by itself. Like, when I’m opening my computer andturning it on, I don’t have to be thinking about five things I haven’t gottendone yet this morning. Blank it out. The crap goes away. Powerful. Then I findmy attention better focused on the here and now. Oh yeah, I'm breathing! Right! My inner self is more calm. I’mable to switch gears more cleanly, without extraneous thoughts dribbling around.I guess it’s like meditation. Only without the label meditation, which alwayssounds like work to me.So my advice to us today is: Don’t feel overwhelmed. Justchoose not to feel that way. Just do stuff, one task at a time. Blank it out nowand then, and see how you feel.What do you think?

{"title": "Fringe Life", "date": "Thursday, June 16, 2016", "text": "Zestful Blog Post #165I started to write a few paragraphs about the terroristmassacre in Orlando, but others have said everything already, and I need tokeep this blog about what it’s about: zestful writing, zestful living. In thatspirit I wish to tell you the results of a small choice I made yesterday.I’m in my hometown of Detroit, on family business. (Localfriends, don’t hate me for not getting in touch. Very tight timelines. I loveyou.)  Marcia and I are staying with a friendin the leafy, low-crime, northern suburbs. I happen to be under contract for anew article for Writer’s Digest magazine, so yesterday when I had a few hoursto myself, I decided to start work on it.My protocol for developing a new article is to hang out inas large a library as is available to me, brainstorm initial notes, and doresearch in the stacks. Yesterday my choice was to go around the corner to anice suburban library, or take half an hour and drive down the crumblingWoodward corridor to the Detroit Public Library.I tried to convince myself to stay north of Eight Mile, butthe pull of the old cultural center was too great. They call the area thatcomprises Wayne State University (where I got my master’s), the main publiclibrary, the Detroit Institute of Arts, and assorted newer museums the CulturalCenter. I knew I’d be disappointed in myself if I didn’t go to the DPL, for oldtime’s sake if nothing else. But I knew in my heart it would be worth it. Thetrip cost extra time, trouble, and, to be honest, anxiety. You just can’t graspthe enormity of the city’s decay via web posts and pictures. I stopped to takea couple of ruin-porn photos en route, steeling myself to be this white ladygetting out of a twenty-year-old Lexus and photographing bombed-out buildingswith only black folks around. Needless to say, no one bothered me.En route I found the whole of Woodward Avenue to be blockedoff: all seven lanes, with police barricades and mounted officers. I sloweddown and saw the cathedral off to the left, remembered I’d listened to theradio yesterday, and thought: right, Gordie Howe’s funeral. So I found aparking place in the Boston-Edison district and walked up to see. Nobody whowasn’t invited could get in to the funeral mass of the hockey legend, ofcourse, so I hung out on the fringes, across the street with some photographersand a few citizens who showed up to honor the sportsman.So yeah: They were broadcasting the mass outside, so wecould hear everything. I noticed that the camera guys were positioned directlyacross from the church main doors, and realized that’s the correct spot to getthe classic casket-being-carried-out shot. Chatted up the fans, who had theirGordie stories. Chatted up the cops, thanked them for serving. Watched themounted officers get down next to their trailer, water their horses, and pourcoffee for themselves.Got back in the car, fought the construction along the restof Woodward, found a parking spot near the library, figured out the newparking-pay kiosk, went in, and got a spot in one of the reading rooms:It’s the coolest library I’ve ever been in, and I’ve been ina lot of major ones. As soon as I established my campsite, my breathing sloweddown, and I got to work making notes and thinking. Who wouldn’t feel completelyat peace in a place like that? Who wouldn’t have wanted to stumble upon alittle piece of Detroit history along the way?There’s a lot to be experienced along the fringes.What do you think?

Lots also believe they can become millionaires by designing a cool newgame. So they sign up for the course. This is not some crummy tutorial, it is acourse designed and presented by MIT, home to the most innovative game lab inthe world.You see where I’m going with this.

Good-by, good-by!—until tonight he is offwith his father, the whole week has exploded white-hot on Saturday morning, andnot even his mother's worried angry kiss can distract him. Out there his fatheris waiting with his hands on his hips, a man. Yes, he is coming!That is the second paragraph of \"Wild Saturday,\" ashort story by Joyce Carol Oates, one of my literary heroes. It was firstpublished in the September, 1970 issue of, unbelievably now, Mademoiselle magazine. Oates had burston the literary scene as a very young woman, and won the National Book Awardwith her novel THEM in the same year this story was published. She was 32.When one reads for pleasure, whether one is a writer or not,the way to learn from another author is to ask, always, these two questions:What is really going on? What am I being told or shown?What's so special about that paragraph from Oates's story?Nothing and everything. It shows us ayoung boy being handed off from Custody Mom to Weekend Dad. The breakup of themarriage was acrimonious. How do we know this? If we're paying close attention,we notice that the parents are so estranged that Dad doesn't even come up tothe front door to greet his ex-wife and collect his son. Is he afraid, ashamed,a wuss? These questions might crop up in our readerly minds. And as we readfurther, we might be on the lookout for answers.If we hadn't caught any significance to dad-on-sidewalk,we're told more by the mother's \"worried angry kiss.\" Yes, the dadcould be a little leery of his ex's suspicion and fury, which is perhaps welljustified. We might already be developing a feeling of uh-oh.Because \"the week has exploded white-hot\" justnow, and the mom evidently has reason to be worried because this isn't thefirst time the boy has gone off with his father on the weekend. We know thisbecause the situation is presented as if routine, not the first time.And because this is the beginning of a story, we know we'regoing to get a story, and the title of the story has the word 'wild' in it, andwe know that the author is Joyce Carol Oates, and because we know her, we knowthat this will almost certainly be a harrowing, spellbinding trip—especially ifwe read it with fine attention.That is how good authors work: with economy and attention toevery detail, to make the most of every word.

{"title": "The Worst Writing Advice", "date": "Thursday, May 26, 2016", "text": "Zestful Blog Post #162The worst writing advice I’ve ever heard is ‘kill your babies.’Many, many fine writers have spewed this advice, including such vastlydifferent story fabricators as William Faulkner and Stephen King. I just huntedup the original reference (thank you, Google), and here it is, from the British novelist and critic Sir Arthur Quiller-Couch, writing in 1914:‘Wheneveryou feel an impulse to perpetrate a piece of exceptionally fine writing, obey it—whole-heartedly—anddelete it before sending your manuscript to press. Murder yourdarlings.’He was being facetious, implying that if you think very highly of something you’ve written, it’s most likely pretentiousdreck. Actually, this is often true for very young writers, or very new ones.The true point of ‘murder your darlings’ is simply this: Youmust have the strength to cut material which is irrelevant or unnecessary tothe piece at hand, in spite of how much pride you feel in it. This is commonsense. Yet many writers get nervous about it, thinking maybe they’re supposedto destroy whatever they think is good. Which is insane.The quotation keeps getting delivered with tremendouspompousness by authors and critics alike, as if it's some kind of golden key to excellence. I’ve also seen critics use it to mean whateverthey want it to mean. I’m always like: Just say something doesn’t work, thenjustify it by whatever literary standards you want.Furthermore, I say, love your babies, love your work, doyour best to write with passion and concision, and forget stupid crap like that.What do you think?

{"title": "5 Keys to Not Looking Like an Imbecile on Web Video", "date": "Thursday, May 19, 2016", "text": "Zestful Blog Post #161Over the past week, I watched eleven webinars on thebusiness of writing and teaching. I learned many things. Some of the mostinteresting had to do with the presenters/panelists themselves. The ones whocame across like stars did a few simple things right, and the ones who came offlooking like cavemen did them wrong.1) Get your camera level with your face. Meaning don’t haveit on your desk or your coffee table so you’re looking down at it. Even peoplein good shape look double-chinned and sleepy from that angle. On a laptop ortablet, the camera is usually a little dot embedded at the top center of theframe around the screen. The screen is not the camera. The screen is not thecamera. The screen is not the camera. An easy way to level the camera is tobooster-seat your laptop on books or a briefcase. Remember briefcases? Maybethere’s one in the attic.2) Look into the camera. When you look at your likeness onthe screen—or the likeness of the person you’re talking to, in a hangout typesituation—you are looking down and away from your audience, and they will spendthe whole time waiting for you to make at least glancing eye contact. When yourface and eyes are level with the camera, you are showing your audience that you’reliterally ‘on the level.’ You look earnest and natural, even though you’reforcing yourself to stare at a tiny inanimate dot. That’s showbiz. 3) Comb your hair and wear something halfway decent on top.I recently had to get ready in a hurry for a book group Skype, so I put on anice top, jewelry, and a little lipstick, but didn’t bother changing out of my elastic-waistcharwoman’s shorts below. For all they knew, I was a hundred percent glamorous.4) Sit up straight. As in back-not-touching-your-chair,Downton Abbey style. When you sit back, especially in an upholstered chair, itlooks like you have bad posture even if you really don’t. Your audience mightnot consciously notice, but these subliminal things add up. If you don’t have ayoga-teacher body, sitting up straight makes you look your trimmest. Also,since the time of Herodotus, civilized people have known that sitting upstraight just makes you feel more bright and energetic.5) Mumble away, if you must, when making your points, butfor the love of God slow down and be clear when mentioning the name of a person,product, or company. It helps even more if you spell it out or give a clue asto the spelling. Not one single person, not even the best of them, did this inany of the eleven webinars I watched. They all threw around the names of webcompanies like they were still swallowing their cereal—was that ConvertIt?ConverKit? Kevorkian? Oh, maybe it’s ConvertKit.6) I can’t help adding a sixth tip, and can’t believe I needto, and it would seem it hardly needs saying, but don’t pick your nose. Iwatched a multimillionaire business owner give a webinar during which he kepthis laptop on the coffee table and for the entire hour looked down at his ownimage on the screen, never the camera; sat back on the couch so he looked porky;mumbled everything; swigged from a two-liter bottle of some beverage; andpicked his nose. He did it starting about a fourth of the way in, and from thenon. The thumb side style. Constantly. Alternated with back-of-hand wiping.Thehilarious thing was that he would look away from his laptop when he did it, sothat HE didn’t see himself picking his nose on camera. I believe he might havepresumed in some reptilian lobe of his brain that therefore WE couldn’t see iteither. To top it off, near the end he humble-bragged about paying $750,000 intaxes last year. The next day I saw a screen shot of him and just got this immediatevisceral feeling of ewww.If you do have to attend to your nose, say, “I begyour pardon for a second,” turn or step away from the camera, and use thehandkerchief or tissue you made ready before starting. It should be right nextto your glass of water and your just-in-case throat lozenges. And if you do have to mention how much you pay in taxes, don't.Now, thanks to me, you will not look like an imbecile on webvideo.Do you have a tip to add or something fun to gripe about?

{"title": "Lost Advice Here Now", "date": "Thursday, May 12, 2016", "text": "Zestful Blog Post #160You must not fear death.That sentence was cut from my book You’ve Got a Book in You: A Stress-Free Guide to Writing the Book of YourDreams. My editor at Writer’s Digest Books made the cut; I suppose hethought it was over the top. It occurred in a chapter about writing freely andgiving yourself permission to write poorly in order to get to the good stuff. AlthoughI noticed the cut I didn’t object, because that piece of advice really needed achunk of explanation, which I hadn’t put in, because I sensed it could have interruptedthe flow of the chapter too much.Of course fear generally is a toxic emotion. I don’t know ofanyone who has ever said fear helped them achieve anything. Caution yes,intelligence yes. You don’t jump over a balcony instead of taking the stairsbecause you’re afraid; it’s because you know you’ll wake up in the ICU or themorgue.When I counsel writers to be fearless, the counsel goes waybeyond the practice of writing.The fear of annihilation—death—is the chiefest of all humanfears, and it of course drives much bad behavior. If I annihilate you first,maybe that will delay my own annihilation. But if we face life accepting thatdeath will come sooner or later and go—OK, so what?—then we are truly free, andwhatever we create will reflect that.What do you think?

{"title": "The Secret Life of Typos", "date": "Thursday, May 5, 2016", "text": "Zestful Blog Post #159Many a spell-check has missed many a typo. I was appalled tobe notified of a typo in the first line of last week’s blog post about how missing ballpointpens form the molten core of the earth. (Thank you, MB, KD, PR, and GC.)It wasn’t a misspelling, it was a usage typo. In my firstdraft of the post, I’d written:[Once, years ago, when I was fumbling around for a pen atwork, a coworker informed me, “The core of the earth is made of moltenballpoint pens.”]When I read it over, I decided I didn’t want ‘coworker’ to followthe word ‘work’ so closely, so I changed ‘coworker’ to ‘office mate,’ like so:[Once, years ago, when I was fumbling around for a pen atwork, a office mate informed me, “The core of the earth is made of moltenballpoint pens.”]As you see, I neglected to change the ‘a’ to ‘an.’ Onlyafter the post went out via email did I learn of that hideous, hideous error.If anyone had opted to unsubscribe after that post, I would have been sohumiliated. Of course I edited the post immediately.One of my correspondents tells me the free program Grammarlyis helpful to catch such problems before they explode into disaster. (Have Imentioned this before?) I haven’t adopted it, though, because I’m fearful thatit would pop up and annoyingly try to correct my sometimes deliberateungrammatical usage. So, live by the self-copy-edit, die by the self-copy-edit.It’s a price I guess I’m willing to pay.However, if you’re a first-time author who wants toself-publish a book, definitely get a professional copy edit before hittingthat upload button. You don’t want to give your audience any extraneous reasonsto be disappointed and look away. If you get a professional copy edit but thecopy editor finds no corrections to make, you will be a first among writers,and you should leave your brain to science.This is pretty much the kind of audience attention you want. These people were watching two guys try to kill each other.Also in last week’s post I used the word ‘incroyable,’ whichwas not a typo, but is French for incredible or amazing. Given that I wastalking about the Olympics in France, I thought it appropriate. Further downthe page I mentioned Parker’s Quink Flow ballpoint cartridges. Quink was thebrand name Parker initially used for a new quick-drying bottled fountain-penink. Now they use it for everything, including cartridges. Why, God, why? BTW,Quink is an example of a portmanteau word: quick and ink. Gonna run myspell-check now.Weirdly, I found an inexplicable copy error in the mostrecent editions of my first novel, HolyHell. I was reading through, making pronunciation notes for the vocalartist who will be voicing the book for Audible, when I found the word softballcapitalized in the middle of a sentence, as if it were a proper noun. It occursin both the Kindle and paperback Create Space versions. It did not occur, Ifound, in the first edition paperback published by Alyson Books; I have no ideahow it came to be capitalized in the current versions, which I went over withfine attention. And over and over. I found a few other minor errors in theother books, mostly formatting mistakes: a missed indent or such. Haven’t fixedthose yet.What do you think of the secret life of typos?

{"title": "To the Ballpoint", "date": "Thursday, April 28, 2016", "text": "Zestful Blog Post #158Once, years ago, when I was fumbling around for a pen atwork, an office mate informed me, “The core of the earth is made of moltenballpoint pens. The ones everybody constantly loses. They migrate through thedirt and eventually arrive at the core of the earth, where they become molten.”Even though I’d minored in geology in college, I thought this theory had a lotof merit.For most of my life, ballpoint pens have justly occupied thelower rungs of scriverdom (I just made up that word—no applause, just throwmoney) because they were so unpleasant to write with. Even though they wereinvented before the turn of the 20th century and mass-produced bymidcentury, 1960s  ballpoints tended tobe sticky and skippy, and you only used them because they were cheap. They evenleaked in pressurized airplane cabins. That fact I learned from watching theMad Men episode where Don and Salvatore fly to someplace and Sal’s pen leaks. (Giventhe context of that episode, the leaking pen is very funny.)BIC pens found a temporary place in my heart after the 1968winter Olympics in Grenoble, France, where Peggy Fleming won gold in women’sfigure skating. Sitting next to my mom on the couch, watching our flickering Zenithblack and white, I was entranced by Peggy’s grace and athleticism, riveted bythe breathless announcers calling her moves: “And now… the double-axel… Yes,she does it…” It was only later that I saw the fabulous chartreuse color of herdress in a magazine. After the Olympics she did a TV commercial for BIC penswhere she skates around a darkened arena just like at the Olympics, with a BIC strapped to her ankle, point down on the ice. Point down. On the ice. Atthe end she does a long hard spin, and man, the ice chips fly! Then she skatesover to a pan of fire—a pan of fire!—just like the Olympic flame, unstraps thepen, and holds the point in the flame for seconds on end. Then, stunningly, shewrites BIC on a pad of paper. Incroyable. So I was like, BIC for president.(Sadly, there seems to be no available video of that spot. If you find it,please send me the link.)The costlier Papermate brand always wrote smoother, andanybody remember Lindy pens? Bullet-shaped cap, metal pocket clip with a cutoutof a tiny seal balancing a ball on its nose. Those were cool pens,smooth-writing, plus they came in different colors. Gone, though.[My current purse pen, a Parker Jotter with Schmidt Easy Flow cartridge.]So once I got old enough to discover the joys of fountainpens, I became a fountain pen devotee, even a fine pencil connoisseur. Butlately I’ve realized that ballpoint technology has moved forward. Of course wehave the ball-tip gel pens, which were a significant leap.Over the course of the past year I’ve been experimentingwith various ballpoint pens and cartridges, and gosh, there are some good onesout there. Anybody familiar with the Schmidt Easy Flow cartridge from Germany?Really smooth and nice. Fits the Parker Jotter and others. The Parker QuinkFlow cartridges are good too, way better than the standard Parker cartridges ofeven 15 years ago.The best part of Parker Jotters, by the way, is the clickmechanism. Hear the biting authority of it, feel the taut certainty of it.Yeah, baby. Did you know that every time you click it, the cartridge rotates120 degrees, to ensure even wear? Brilliant.I’ve heard good things about the Monteverde Superbroadrefills and have a few in my Amazon cart. Various ink manufacturers have gotteninto making Parker-compatible refills, to satisfy different customer tastes.And, given funding sites like Kickstarer and so on, metalsmiths are designingand selling small-batch nice pens of aluminum and other metals that will take thoserefills. I have a few, and I suppose I'll wax poetic about those someday.Write on. I’d be very interested to hear anyballpoint-related thoughts you might wish to share.

{"title": "NPR's Appalling Language", "date": "Thursday, April 21, 2016", "text": "Zestful Blog Post #157On Monday (April 18, 2016) I was listening to Diane Rehm’s showon NPR while driving around to some appointments. I’m not a die-hard NPRdevotee, but I do tune in sometimes. The reason I’m not a die-hard devoteeto NPR is the bewildering language used by some of the guests—not so much thehosts. Diane Rehm is blameless. Diane Rehm for president.My beef is with the guests / interviewees who torturelanguage trying to make themselves sound more intellectual. Often, I’m sad tosay, they are writers. Writers who have written books published by intellectualpresses about intellectual things like social theories.Having cut my teeth as a newspaper reporter and editor, myanti-bullshit axe is sharp and fierce. Maybe I’m just getting older andcrabbier, or maybe the NPR problem is really getting worse. I think it’sgetting worse. Things were so bad Monday morning that I had to pull over notonce but twice, and make notes.A group of guests were talking about Brexit. You know, thepossible exit of Britain from the European Union. The word Brexit is fine. It’sa witty shorthand that one could text to friends when messaging about worldaffairs.But when one guest said, “The atmospherics of the summitwill be tense,” I was like, what did she just say? Atmospherics? Why would yousay that when you mean atmosphere? Oh, of course: to sound brainier! People whouse words with more syllables are perceived as being more intelligent thanordinary folk. You have to listen with some alertness to notice when the extrasyllables are phony.Here’s another one from the same conversation, differentguest, who was asked about reciprocity between Britain and the EU if BritainBrexits. “Well, the automaticity of that will no longer be there.” What thef*ck? Automaticity? Have you ever heard that word before? But you know exactlywhat the guy meant: The reciprocity would go away. But when you’re in front ofa microphone, whether on the radio or a dais, air time is important. Fill itwith syllables, preferably ones that can more or less be grasped by peopledumber than you. Automaticity originated as a science word to describe certainfunctions in cells, then became, according to the Free Dictionary: “Acting oroperating in a manner essentially independent of external influence or control:an automatic light switch; a budget deficit that triggered automatic ...”Automaticity is actually a perfect NPR word: It's unnecessarily complicated andnot really accurate, yet it’s easy to tell what the speaker means. Side one of my angrily scribbled note card.Another guest, discussing his book about the dangersglobal aid workers face, used the term ‘sea change,’ which bugged me, becausethe clearer, simpler ‘change’ would have sufficed. Sea change is a somewhatarchaic term referring to the shift in one’s perceptions, mostly having to dowith sense of balance, when one embarks on a long sea voyage. The movement ofthe sea makes for lots of vestibular input, and one feels different, andpossibly out of sorts, until one adapts. MFK Fisher, by the way, wrotebeautifully (and economically) about the subject in The Gastronomical Me. People now use sea change to mean a vastchange. When you say sea change, you simply sound more worldly, don’t you?The same guest said, “The safety of aid workers evolves ontothe local population.” He of course should have said devolved, but he waseither unsure of that, or he sensed many listeners would think devolve isincorrect in that usage. But it’s correct. This example isn’t exactly parallelto the others, but valuable nevertheless, to illustrate the deep insecuritiesof many NPR guests.Same guest: “Secondly, and probably most foundationally…”Foundationally? Beautiful. So much more dolled up than basically. Moresyllables, more letters. Same guest: “The latter question is of sentinel importance.”Lovely! The term is completely meaningless, yet you instantly know that hemeant special importance, or more probably, signal importance. But sentinel! Anextra syllable!

{"title": "Coffee as LSD", "date": "Thursday, April 14, 2016", "text": "Zestful Blog Post #156I know not every writer enjoys coffee. Some unfortunatesouls must abstain for religious reasons (which, like, easy solution, justswitch religions, right?); some have health issues and others are actuallyallergic (which, total pity).But for the rest of us the bean might as well BE asacrament. I love to read about the history of coffee, and I love to comeacross random coffee facts, such as Union soldiers chewed the beans for energyin the Civil War. I think the Atlantic blockades kept it from the Confederacy. Andsome still wonder why they lost?Caffeine’s a drug—a stimulant—and an overdose will kill aperson. I mentioned LSD in the title of this post. LSD is a hallucinogen, ofcourse, which lots of seekers have used to open their creativity chakras orwhatever. When I was in college I badly wanted to try LSD but rumor had it that alot of the current supply was contaminated with PCP (horse anesthetic,basically), so I never did it. (Everything else, yes.) The thing is, if you’reopen to it, coffee, like LSD, can make you a better writer.[The Snow Peak double-walled titanium mug keeps your beveragehot for a long time, which is good if your office is upstairs and theinstant-hot and microwave are downstairs. The other one is my politically incorrectbecause of animal abuse mug, but I really like it anyway and the elephant is nolonger in pain. I know I should somehow make it so there’s a link to these cupswhich if you click them I’ll get money, but screw it.]Research suggests the experience is diluted if you put in sugarand milk. So make it black, and don’t waste it by drinking it first thing inthe morning, simply to help wake up. Use weak tea or something for your firsthit of caffeine. Hydrate by drinking water before and after breakfast. Save agood strong cup of black for when you’re ready to write. (Tim Ferris’s The Four-Hour Body turned me on toadding a shake of Vietnamese cinnamon for flavor and better blood sugar levelsthroughout the day.)

{"title": "Just Sit Right Back", "date": "Thursday, April 7, 2016", "text": "Zestful Blog Post #155Quick announcement: Sign up here to win one of three Kindlecopies of Damn Straight at theLesbian Review.Today’s post is about writing with economy. Most of us who watchedtelevision in the 1960s are still afflicted with old brainworms in the form of themesongs from sitcoms. I can still, after enough gin, sing the complete themesfrom Gilligan’s Island, the Patty Duke Show, Green Acres, and the Beverly Hillbillies, aswell as shards from Petticoat Junction and the Brady Bunch.Not long ago I read about why the Gilligan’s Island song waswritten. Sherwood Schwartz, who conceived of the show about a motley group ofcastaways on a desert island, had trouble convincing TV executives to put itinto production. Their main objection was that it would be tedious to recap, duringevery episode, why and how the people got stuck on the island.So Schwartz went home and, with composer George Wyle, wrote a theme song that told thestory perfectly: “Just sit right back and you’ll hear a tale, a tale of afateful trip…” The song rolled through the opening credits, so a first-timeviewer would be as savvy as a devotee. The execs’ problem was solved, and theygreen-lighted the project. The show became such an off-kilter hit, it affectedpop culture in multiple ways, from phrases from the song (“a three-hour tour,”for instance, as shorthand for an unexpectedly interminable situation), to Gilligan’swhite bucket hat and more.My favorite phrase from the song: “The ship set ground onthe shore of this uncharted desert isle…” It’s brilliant. You learn why nobody’sfound them: the island’s not on any maps! Uncharted! One simple word, thrown infast.The other sitcom songs achieve the identical objective. Mypoint: All writers can learn from these seemingly stupid songs! Look a few up online, read andlisten to them carefully, and perceive all sorts of lessons on how to writewith purpose and economy.Have you ever found a writing lesson in an unexpected place?

{"title": "Bits of Divinity", "date": "Thursday, March 31, 2016", "text": "Zestful Blog Post #154This post is about one of those chance encounters that cancount for nothing or everything.On Tuesday afternoon my new friend Nan took me to the DesMoines (Iowa) Art Center, where we enjoyed a little lunch in the café and a walkthrough the collection and special exhibits. The center is really prettyimpressive, having been designed in various stages by I.M. Pei, Eliel Saarinen,and Richard Meier. The collection is equally impressive for a smaller city. Oneof the security guards answered a question about the architecture of the place,then struck up a deeper conversation with us.Milton L. Bunce, Jr. has been working there for years, andhe’s come to know the place intimately—at a level beyond knowing the works thatlive there. He asked us to note the shadows in the atria and other rooms withwindows, and invited us to notice how the light changes, throughout the day, throughoutthe year. The architects knew what they were doing, he felt. We were receptive.Mr. Bunce opened an upper fire escape door and showed us the view of the lawnand sculptures from there. He asked us to imagine what it all looks like in thedifferent seasons, the fiery trees in the fall, the dry white wash of winter. Thenhe asked if we’d like to see something special. We would.He unlocked a storage cabinet and took out a couple oftattered sketchbooks, which were filled with his own pencil drawings. He onlytook up drawing a few years ago, he said, but he’d gotten pretty good.He showed us his drawings, including one of him in his Navyuniform with his wife when they were first married. He copied it from a photo. During quiet times, Mr. Bunce is allowedto work on his drawings right in the museum. His sole tools are a number-4pencil and an eraser.He said he tries to interest the schoolchildren who come tothe museum in drawing, too. Not an easy thing. But I bet a few have looked andlistened.When we parted from Mr. Bunce, I remarked to Nan that it waslike bumping into Christ. Which is exactly what it is when you meet up withsomeone who is open, who gives it everything he’s got, and who just naturallyexpects you to be open, too. Call it Christ or any other name you might give tothat pure human beauty that everyone carries inside. Not all of us let it shinethrough all the time, though. But that’s what it’s all about, I think.(Had a blast doing dinner with students and faculty, thenreading and talking about the writing life that evening at Simpson College. It’swonderful to meet new people enthusiastic about writing, reading, and teaching.Thanks, Nan.)What do you think?

{"title": "Writing Clueless vs. Oblivious", "date": "Thursday, March 24, 2016", "text": "Zestful Blog Post #153Looking forward to doing a reading, then chatting and doingQ&A with students at Simpson College near Des Moines, Iowa next Tuesdayevening. If you’re local, drop in! Thanks to Professor Nan St. Clair for setting it up.One of my early jobs was in the HR department of a largebank in Detroit. It was so long ago that I wrote and starred in a video toeducate our customers on how to use them there brand-fangled ATM machines.Customers were issued ATM cards and everybody created their PIN. Itwas quite a thing, having this important four-digit passcode to remember! Don't ask me about my curly perm.The bank’s president brought his nephew over from Englandone summer to work in various departments of the bank; he hung around HRfor a week or so. The young man thought ATMs were the coolest. He showed us hisATM card, upon which he’d written his PIN.“You’re not supposed to do that!” we told him, aghast. “Thatdefeats the whole purpose!”“My uncle told me to,” he said. “That’s what he does.”When Lady Diana was getting to know Prince Charles, she wasstunned to learn that he had no idea how to make a cup of tea.U.S. troops working with the South Vietnamese Army (ARVN) taughtthem how to shoot down Vietcong helicopters. You have to lead them, theyexplained, meaning train your rifle sights just ahead of the copters’ noses,then shoot. ARVN troops shot down numerous Cong choppers. But when they had achance to ambush and shoot Cong choppers on the ground, they also carefully aimedahead of the copter’s noses, then pulled their triggers.[Note of correction here, dateline 3.25.16: My militaryexpert advises that this scenario is unlikely to have happened, due to the veryfew North Vietnamese aircraft used in the war. More likely, he suggests, Iremembered reading about the reverse situation, where NVA soldiers were trainedto take down American aircraft by the same method, and making the same mistakeon stationary aircraft. Thank you, SD!]The common thread here is cluelessness. And the reason forcluelessness is lack of information, and sometimes a lack of skill in objectiveanalysis. You can have a lot of fun with clueless characters. I mean, who forGod’s sake would believe the president of the bank would write his PIN on hisATM card? Yet it was so. Therefore in your writing, you need to sprinklecluelessness sparingly. One way to do it is bracket something a character isclueless about with things they’re savvy about. The bank president, forinstance, sure as heck knew what to make of balance sheets, and how todelegate. Vietnamese troops knew a lot about jungle survival, and could fight liketigers hand to hand.Obliviousness is a little different. My brother remembersbeing dropped off for his weekend job in a grocery store by our dad after arainstorm. As he brought the car to a stop, Daddy splashed through a huge mud puddle,drenching a guy who was walking by. “And I had to get out,” said my brother grimly. “Daddywas oblivious.”People in the throes of infatuation are often oblivious to anyflaws in their beloved. This has fueled countless dramas and rom-coms, both inprint and on the screen. But obliviousness has to be believable, and never usedto hotfoot it over a plot hole. The crime-scene techs simply missed the bloodyfingerprints on the refrigerator door? They just, like, forgot to look at them?No. But each guy could have thought the other guy was going to process thosemarks. By the time they realized their mistake weeks later, the crime scene hadbeen released and cleaned. A self-centered person could be oblivious to the pain of aloved one. Show us the self-centeredness, then show us the obliviousness.Even if you don’t know what you need until you need it, youcan go back and create traits and circumstances that will bring everything to convincinglife.

Gonna teach “FearlessWriting” and “How to Write Dialogue Like a Pro,” and will be available forindividual consults as well. They’re still putting together the lineup, buthere’s the link. Will talk writing for martinis come bar time. Tankregular, dry, up, olives. Think of it as an investment.2)My Marcia has designed, built, and launched an extraordinarymath game for kids and adults. Number Round-Up uses the world’s smartest tinyhorses to help players master sorting, set theory, commonalities, and more. Getlinks to the free demo and paid versions at Logical Game Studio. Thisreally is a cool game, currently in the Chrome store. No ads, no upselling, just a well built, charming, thoroughly kid-and-adult-testedgame that helps foster a love of math and logic. If you take a look, I’d loveto hear what you think of it!On to today’s post.Dearest writer, do you sometimes struggle to describe yourcharacters in a way that works smoothly with your action and plot? Do you havetoo much self respect to make them stand in front of a mirror and remark upontheir baggy eyes / shining auburn hair / six-pack physique, etc? Is itespecially challenging to describe a character’s changes over time, whether monthsor decades?Help is here. In the last few months I’ve suggested this toa few clients, and today thought I’d share it with everybody. Very simple: Letsomebody come upon an old snapshot, whether on coated paper from a Pleistocene-eracamera, a Kodachrome slide that has to be held up to the light, or somethingdigital.[Musical and bossy even back then: Leading theneighborhood band.Photo thanks to old pal BB.]You are with me on this instantly, right? The picture can beof the character himself or herself (just can’t do ‘themself,’ neverwill), or of a beloved, or the enemy, or whoEVER.Example:While clearing out Jesse’s room, she came upon a snapshot ofhim with his 1978 prom date. She didn’t remember the girl at all. But there wasJesse standing tall, his gaze level and composed, in spite of the crazy maroonvelvet tuxedo he was wearing. Nother Example:No return address. I tore open the envelope. A black-and-whitesnapshot with crinkle-cut edges fell out, and I immediately recognized my stepfatherstanding beneath the wing of his plane with his flight crew. Full head of wind-tossedhair, wolfen grin, and that cold look in his eyes I remembered so well, toowell.Nother Example:He surfed over to CNN and couldn’t believe it: There shewas, smiling on the courthouse steps, looking pale but triumphant. Acquitted!Wearing her hair still in those stupid pigtails. Pink lipstick. Pink dress. Hell!Last Example:I went back to my first post on Facebook. Talk about depressing. The only picture I could think to post was of me in my judo outfit getting slammed onto the mat by a bigger kid. I was spindly and bucktoothed then, spindly and bucktoothed now.You get the idea.

{"title": "Arguing with a Publisher", "date": "Thursday, March 10, 2016", "text": "Zestful Blog Post #151Sometimes aspiring writers ask if I’ve ever been told bya publisher to change a manuscript in a way I thought was wrong. Yes, is theanswer, and of course the next question is, well, what did you do? I was planning to write about this sometime soon, when coincidentally thisexact subject came up in a message conversation with a friend on FB this week,as well as tangentially with a client. Thanks for the nudge, R and B.In my series of posts (November 20, 2014 to March 12, 2015)on my publishing history, I recounted how I made significant changes in some ofmy manuscripts to satisfy my agent’s or an editor’s request. These happenedbecause I felt their suggestions would improve the story. Good agents and editorsare worth listening to.But there’ve been a few times when I’ve said no. Oneparticular instance was during the editing of On Location, the third in my Rita Farmer series. In that story,Rita searches the wilderness of the Pacific Northwest for her missing sisterand the sister’s fiancé. After slogging all over the woods and getting closer andcloser, Rita makes a breakthrough when she impersonates a Native American tofind out some information.A professional actress, Rita uses pigment to darken hercomplexion and hair, and puts on makeshift medicine-woman regalia to lookconvincing to the non-Indians she’ll be confronting. She carries a hatchet inher belt. The scene, both scary and funny, is about confidence, disguise, actingunder life-and-death pressure, and the credulousness of an audience unpreparedfor a ruse. It is the crux move of the novel, and I crafted the story to leadsmoothly up to that point.One of my editors at Minotaur told me to cut the stuff aboutRita putting on the disguise. I believe he felt it was grossly politicallyincorrect to put brownface on a white character. For sure, it was a risk. I deliberatelytake risks in my fiction. For instance, in TheExtra, some of my characters are black, and they live in South L.A., andnot all of them use proper English. That—a white writer portraying blackcharacters talking ghetto or even slightly ungrammatical English—is consideredoffensive by some, and I heard from a couple of them after the book came out. Butif you’ve ever hung out in South Los Angeles, you've heard a lot ofnonstandard English. Is it honest to write all such characters as if they comefrom somewhere else? It’s safe, but it’s not honest and moreover, it doesn’tsound real.In Rita’s situation in OnLocation, I took care to make Rita look somewhat silly, and to make thewhite people she deceives dull-witted. I did write a real NativeAmerican character into the book, who wouldn’t have been fooled by Rita’s getup.Prior to writing Rita’s transformation, I researched the customs, clothing, andregalia used by the real Indians in the area, where I was living at the time. Iwent to the reservation and looked around, and I went to the woods and figuredout how to make the scene work.If I were to cut that scene, I’d have to rewrite themajority of the book. I went to some lengths to defend the scene and thoseleading up to it. The editor backed off. I suspect he thought I’d made it allup on the fly, without thinking much about it. And he hadn't fully thought through the scene's relationship to the structure of the novel. My explanations convinced him wecould stand behind the accuracy and spirit of the story.When the book came out, I heard from many readers—and reviewers—whothought the Rita-as-Indian scenes were a hoot. One reader, however, wrote me a stern email telling me what a horrible racist I was. “I hope no Indianreads this book,” she wrote. She particularly objected to Rita’s narrativesentence, “I worked to project intelligent savagery.” The word ‘savage’ isconsidered an insensitive label by Indians, this correspondent told me. Shehappened to be local, she said, and she worked at the library near thereservation. I gathered she was white.Usually I write back to such readers with a simple, “I’msorry the book disappointed you.” No defense, no trying to convince somebody ofsomething they don’t want to hear.But I wrote back to this woman asking who was offended bythe book—she, a politically correct white person? Has she met or heard of anyIndian who has read the book and found it offensive? Well, no, she wrote back,and had to admit that her principles were the ones involved, and she wasspeaking for herself. We had a fairly cordial exchange, and that was that.During the editing of one of my earlier books, I called upmy editor to complain about numerous discretionary changes the copy editor hadmade. That is, not things like corrected grammar, spelling, punctuation, orusage, but things like extra commas, deleted words, and changes that dumbed thework down. She defended the copy editor, and I said, “Well, then, take my nameoff the front and put yours and his. You can be co-authors. Publish it thatway.” She backed off.My point is this: Your name, in the end, is the one that’sgonna be on the book jacket. You have to be pretty sure of what you write. Ifyou’ve done your homework and been honest with yourself and your material, you’rejustified in standing up for your work when the occasion arises.What do you think?

{"title": "Actress Promo Report", "date": "Thursday, March 3, 2016", "text": "Zestful Blog Post #150Thought you might be interested in some facts and figurestoday. Over last weekend and into this week I put The Actress up for free on Amazon Kindle, for the full 5-day periodallowed, from Friday through Tuesday. Initially I thought I’d just make it freethrough Sunday (Oscar) night, but decided to leave it up the whole time,because it was doing so well.First, context. My fiction is all in the Amazon ‘Select’program, meaning the books are only available in e-book form on Amazon Kindle.The benefits, so far, are worth it to me. The vast majority of e-books are soldon Amazon, and if your books are in the Select program, you get more exposureand more money. This isn’t necessarily meant to be a ringing endorsement of theprogram, it’s just to explain why I, an author who values simplicity, amsticking with it for now. Your ‘Select’ books can be read for ‘free’ by readerswho have signed up for Kindle Unlimited or KU (they pay $9.95 per month forunlimited access), and for actual free by readers who own a Kindle device (via theKindle Owners Lending Library, or KOLL).Free is good. You reach readers this way who wouldn’tnecessarily find and buy your books on their own. The immediate benefit is thatyou, the author, get paid per page of free material read. It’s a fraction of acent per page, but it adds up (example below). The extended benefit, of course,is that some readers who like your work will read and buy more and become fans.Last week’s promo was the first time The Actress was free to anyone who wanted it. On Friday when mynewschat and blog about it went out, readers downloaded it 2,629 times. Saturday:1,408. Sunday: 731. Kind of a geometric progression. To my surprise, the book quickly reached #1 in the Amazonfree store in the legal thriller category, and it ranged between 8thand 11th in the female sleuth category. It also broke into the top100 free books overall, reaching #63 at its best.Meanwhile, not much happened with my other titles, which, I’vefound, is typical when a free promo is running. My sales and free pages read weresuffering from the winter blues, and I hoped this promo would help. The bump,if you’re going to get one, generally comes after the free promo is over.As of Sunday night the book was still the #1 free legalthriller, so I decided to let the promo go the maximum time, through Tuesday,just to see if the ranking would hold, even though free downloads were slowing waydown.On Monday 400 more readers downloaded the book, and onTuesday 427 did. A few spilled into Wednesday given international time zones:17. So total: 5,612. That’s a lot of potential readers. Now, authors havelearned that not everybody who downloads your freebie reads it, but a bunchwill get to it, sooner or later. The book’s rank dropped to #2 and then #4 infree legal thrillers as of Tuesday afternoon, then I stopped keeping track.Sales of my other books have bumped up a little in the lastcouple of days, but it’s too early to tell how well that will go or how long itwill last. Mainly it’s the KU and KOLL pages read that have soared. As soon asthe promo started, they jumped from dismally below 1,000 per day to way over that.Yesterday KU and KOLL readers made it through 3,776 of my pages. As I’m writingthis midday today, about a thousand pages have been read.[There was a bit of a bump for the quickie free promo of Easy Street I ran earlier in February,but the big spike is the result of TheActress promo.]Let’s say you average 3,000 free pages a day. At .0058 centsper page, which is the last I figured it, that equals $522 in a 30-day month.Not a king’s ransom, but nothing to sneeze at.I’m ramping up my promo work for my books, primarily bywriting and planning more releases. I’ve been talking a little bit about Crimes in a Second Language; stay tunedfor more on that this month.What do you think?

{"title": "Audible Deal and More", "date": "Friday, February 26, 2016", "text": "Zestful Blog Post #149Dearest Zestful A-lister,As promised yesterday, here’s my newschat that went out thismorning. Forgive and delete if you’re already on that list.Newschat for Brighter SkiesDearest Correspondent,We know there are only four seasons, but scientists haverecently determined that winter actually has five subseasons: 1) holidaybuildup, 2) holidays, 3) holiday downslope, 4) gray skies, and 5) despair. Evenin Florida people complain about winter. The locals get out their coats and furboots when temperatures plummet into the low seventies, while seasonal peopleget upset if it’s too windy to golf. Be that as it may. Here now the news, withbright-sky wishes for you and yours.1) The audio book company Audible made an offer on all fiveof my Lillian Byrd crime novels, and we signed the contract last week. This wasin the works for quite a while. Am thrilled that Lillian will have a voice! Wasable to approve the narrator; more about her next time. Mega thanks to the teamat the Donald Maass Literary Agency for making it happen: Rights Director KatieShea Boutillier and Agent Cameron McClure.Not sure when the audio books will be available, though therumor is several months out from contract signing. Funny thing: I realized Ineed to reread those books closely and make pronunciation notes for thenarrator, so I’m doing that in betwixt and between other stuff. Detroiters havedeveloped idiosyncratic pronunciations for countless streets and places. Ask aDetroiter how to get to Gratiot or Livernois or Ecorse.2) In honor of this weekend’s Oscars (which I don’t usuallywatch, but hey, it’s a good excuse to do a promo), The Actress – Rita Farmer mystery #1is free on Amazon Kindle.If you haven’t snagged it yet, please do. I hope youenjoy it! Maybe it will whet your appetite for the next two in the series, The Extra and On Location. (I might note that youdon’t need a Kindle device to download the book; you can get the free app forjust about any device you can use to get connectivity.) And yes, I know I’vebeen promising the fourth in the series forever, but bear with me. I swear I’llget it out there.3) Meanwhile, I’m nearly finished with final edits on amainstream standalone that I’ll be self-pubbing through my imprint Spruce ParkPress. Crimes in a Second Language wasinspired by my Aunt Tracy, who befriended her cleaning woman after discoveringthat she was not only illiterate, but had barely attended school at all in hernative Mexico. My story takes two similar women on a twisty road througheducation, insight, deception, and (naturally enough) dangerous malfeasance.More soon. 4) It’s a little late to report this, but Lillian Byrd #5, Left Field,did in fact win a Goldie award at last year’s GCLS conference. Very happy aboutthat. And no, I can’t make it to the GCLS con this year—too much other travelgoing on. Hope to have news of other appearances soon.5) With enormous help from Marcia, my website got a makeover last fall, and Icouldn’t be happier with it.6) My blog keepsgoing, as well as articles for Writer’sDigest magazine. Most recent is “Power Tools” in the January issue. CurrentlyI’m writing one for them on “The Little Things” that are easy for writers tooverlook but can make a huge difference in the quality of your work.7) My work will also appear in the forthcoming CraftingDynamic Dialogue: The Complete Guide to Speaking, Conversing, Arguing, andThinking in Fiction (Writer’s Digest Books, June 2016). I was honoredto be asked to write an original chapter on internal dialogue for it. Also, they’llbe using some material from my book You’ve Got a Book in You.Thanks for your company!

{"title": "Pulitzers and Oscars and Harper Lee's Lawyer", "date": "Thursday, February 25, 2016", "text": "Zestful Blog Post #148When writing or speaking about the craft of writing, I oftengive examples from famous books. As it happens, a great many famous books havebeen made into movies. This is not by accident, I tell my audiences. Storiesthat resonate deeply in the human heart find their way around.To Kill a Mockingbirdby Harper Lee was one of the first novels I ever read. I remember being soyoung I didn’t know what rape was, and I didn’t understand that Mr. Ewell did NOTfall on his knife. Growing up, I read the story dozens of times, and still rereadit every few years, in spite of having been told by a college professor that itwas a contemptible book. This professor, in the middle of teaching Saul Bellow’sMr. Sammler’s Planet, somehow found away to bring up To Kill a Mockingbirdand sneer at it, because in the end, the little white children are safe “andeverything’s all nicey-nice.” I don’t know about you, but I couldn’t recap theplot of Mr. Sammler’s Planet if mylife depended on it.Harper Lee’s smash hit book was made into a terrific movie, whichis as beloved as the book. I’m writing about this because it’s Oscar time. Thefilm version of Mockingbird won a fewOscars. I’m getting to my point.Which has to do with Harper Lee’s other book, Go Set a Watchman, which got publishedlast year. Just to get this straight, Mockingbirdbrought tons of attention to Lee, who hated the attention, who retreated frompublic life, who said she’d never publish another book, but oh, my gosh! Herlawyer “finds” this ol’ manuscript—just now!—and gets an idea! And at the ageof 88, after having a stroke and being in an assisted-living facility, Harper’slike, cool, I’d thought that stack of paper was lost for good! Let’s dust thispuppy off and publish it! Heck, yes. I can’t wait! And what’s more, I reallydon’t need to do any edits, or even talk to the publisher myself; my lawyerwill handle everything. She has my best interests at heart.Right.So the book, which I haven’t read because I’m boycotting it,reportedly portrays Atticus Finch as a racist, and puts an ugly coda onto theone brilliant gift Harper Lee gave the world. Do we think Watchman is going to win the Pulitzer? They’re talking about makinga movie of it. No doubt they will. Suppose that’ll win some Oscars? A Pulitzerand some Oscars?Right.And that’s my point.Here’s a tiny gift for you, dear reader who has stuck with me all theway to the bottom: Advance notice of our latest giveaway: Starting at midnightPacific time tomorrow, Friday, TheActress (Rita Farmer mystery #1) will be free on Kindle through the weekend. In honor of the Oscars,naturally! This is the first time it's been free. Also, stay tuned for a newschat coming tomorrow with more announcements.I’ll post it here on the blog as well as send it to my newschat list.What do you think?

{"title": "No More Bad Self Label", "date": "Thursday, February 18, 2016", "text": "Zestful Blog Post #147When my mother turned 50, she decided to learn to play thepiano. I, age about 16 and a serious musician, was surprised, because Mom hadnever evinced any musical talent or ability, ever. But I was happy that shewanted to learn. She bought a piano (only a spinet, but at least it was new)and hired a teacher, who set her to work on the rudiments of reading music andplaying simple tunes.I was able to help her a little between lessons, and I enjoyedplinking around on the instrument myself. God, isn’t the sound of a piano lovely?Mom’s progress was slow, but so what? One day, however, she dropped her handsinto her lap and said, “Oh, I’m so bad!”I said, “No, no, you’re just starting to learn.”She  shook her head. “Idon’t expect to be the next Van Cliburn. All I want is to be able to come homefrom seeing a musical, and just sit down at the piano and play all the songs fromit!” She pantomimed playing lush chords with her left hand and fast melodieswith her right. My blood ran cold as I understood how clueless she was as tohow much experience and skill such a seemingly casual feat would require. Mom constantly felt discouraged, and I saw that it wasbecause of her unrealistic expectations. “I’m so bad,” she would say all thetime. I couldn’t get her to understand the difference between being a novice atsomething and being bad at something. We knew a bad piano player. “Look at theJordans’ daughter,” I’d say. “She’s a bad piano player. Why? Because she’s beentaking lessons and playing for twelve years and she still sounds like crap. Nofeeling, no heart.”That didn’t cut any ice with Mom. Eventually she quit andgave the piano away. “I was just so bad.”This story relates, of course, to any art. A novice mustlearn the craft, gain the skills, study up, and practice. Progress, generally,is uneven: often slow, but occasionally you make a breakthrough and somethingthat was hard is now easy. Patience, laddies and lassies, patience andpersistence. Novices must not think in terms of bad or good. Learning andgaining facility is all that matters.A bad writer is a person who has developed a mediocre levelof facility (at most) and who is satisfied by that, and who does not seek toimprove beyond it. A good writer is a person who has achieved a respectablelevel of facility (at least) and whocontinues to strive to get better, and whose work indeed shows developmentand improvement over the course of his or her career. The striving to getbetter part makes a good writer exactly like a novice. It’s a Zen thing, really:If we bring beginner’s mind—that is, open, eager, receptive, committed—to everythingwe do—Well, let’s just try it and see what happens.What do you think?

{"title": "Lying is Good for You", "date": "Thursday, February 11, 2016", "text": "Zestful Blog Post #145Writers need to keep their brains sharp and guts alive, andone way to do it is be on the lookout for opportunities to lie. I’m not talkingabout the lying we do in our fiction, which is, of course, the whole point. Neitheram I talking about malicious lying; my subject here is recreational lying. Recreational lying pumps your adrenaline and challenges your wit. I discussedthis a little in Zestful Post #54 (“5 Good Reasons to Make Stuff Up), but wantto expand a bit on it here.Life is just too damn boring sometimes. Enough bloggers rantabout our hyper-risk-averse culture and our increasingly ensafened publicspaces (rubber cushions beneath the monkey bars; helmet laws). But I feel one’scomfort zone is one’s own business, and it’s up to us to stay in it or step outof it. Lying is such an easy way to walk on the wild side.One of my favorite recreational lies happened at a summerpolo match in the Detroit area back in the 90s. (Someplace like FarmingtonHills, as I remember.) The Borders Book Shop I managed in Birmingham was anadvertiser on the local classical radio station, so I regularly got invited tothank-you parties, which was a nice perk. For one such party, the station(WQRS, anybody fondly and sadly remember it?) set up a lavish hospitality tentat a polo match. Though I’d never been to a polo match, I guessed correctlythat one should dress nicely and be on good behavior.I wore a crisp chambray skirt and a sleeveless top, whichjust happened to expose the fresh blackwork tattoo I’d received on my rightupper arm a month before. It was a grasshopper, or locust, designed by me andinked by a well-known artist in Ann Arbor. (Anybody remember Suzanne of Creative Tattoo? Anotherbygone entity.) I’d wanted a symbol of strength and lightness, and thought thehopper a good choice. Being so new, the tattoo was profoundly black and starkagainst my white-girl skin.[As seen in Skin Art magazine, vol.1, no. 7. For real.]It’s safe to say mine was the only visible tattoo on thewhole polo grounds. I might characterize the other guests as upper crust; mostwere prosperous business owners and their spouses. I was experienced enough toknow, however, that most of them would be somewhat nervous coming to such ahoity-toity event—this was Detroit, after all—and therefore vulnerable andcredulous.As the horses thundered to and fro, I snagged a mimosa andheaded for the buffet of first-class delicacies. Three society gals of acertain age assembled behind me in line. I heard a brief whisper, and turned.Decked out in pastels and their afternoon pearls, they were staring at mytattoo. One found her nerve and said, “Where did you—what’s—?”“Oh,” I said with a smile and a shrug, “I used to live inLos Angeles, and I was in a girl gang for a while. This was the initiationtattoo we all had to get.”Their faces were just so fabulous. Just writing about it, I feel the rush all over again.Most recently, I recreationally lied at a restaurant inMount Dora, Florida. Marcia and I were getting up to leave, and the couple atthe table behind us were interested in the pork chop special. “What’s itstuffed with?” asked the guy. The server took off to check for sure.Without thinking at all, I leaned in and said, “Ze porkshop, eet ees fabulous. Ees ver’good—ver’good. You try eet, OK?” Somehow I sensed zey deed not speak Frainch. They gazed at me with respect, and when the server returned,the guy ordered the chop. I nodded my approval, though I had eaten the steak salad. The couple’s eyes followed Marciaand me to the door, and I just felt that much more alive.There’s nothing wrong with taking vitamins and obeying thespeed limit in school zones. But recreational lying is downright good for you,your brains, and your guts.What do you think?

{"title": "Story Writing Demo II", "date": "Thursday, February 4, 2016", "text": "Zestful Blog Post #144One of my favorite myths, since I could read, is the storyof Baucis and Philemon, first written down by Ovid. (Baucis is properly pronounced Baw-kis,and with Philemon you place your emphasis on the first syllable.) They were anold, poor but hardworking couple who lived in a hut. I believe a thin cowlurked outside. Cows in these tales are always thin.One day Mercury decided to have some fun on Earth. He tookoff slumming, disguised as a hiker, and around noontime approached the humblehut. He wondered if he might have some refreshment. Baucis and Philemonwelcomed him in, and set the table with all the food they had: a loaf of bread,some cheese, some grapes, and a pitcher of milk (remember thin cow).Mercury ate some food, and they all shared the milk. When Mercury asked formore, Baucis sadly upended the pitcher to show it was empty—but what do youthink?Milk spilled all over, and the pitcher never went dry again;it always brimmed with fresh, delicious milk. They would never starve. What’smore, Mercury asked the couple what their dearest wish was. They answered thatthey’d like never to be apart. Mercury went away quietly, and saw to it thattheir wish was granted. When they died, they became an oak and a linden tree,which grew intertwined forever. I’ve seen other versions of the story in whichthe magic pitcher contained wine instead of milk, which, hey, cool. (Picture ofBaucis and Mercury from my Wonder Bookby Nathaniel Hawthorne, 1935 edition. Illustration by Milo Winter. Note friendly snakes from the god's caduceus ready to lap up the spill.)The moral, of course, is that one should be good toeveryone, because one never knows who that stranger really is. This is part of manyspiritual teachings: “Whatsoever you do to the least of my brothers, that youdo unto me.” Do good for the sake of doing good, and reward will come in theform of good karma, or possibly eternal life, or maybe even a new Corvette.You never know.How to translate this to a modern story? First let’s unpackit. We have: the poverty and kindliness of Baucis and Philemon; the powerfulgod who can confer reward as well as, we assume, punishment; the enduring loveof the old couple; and finally, the god’s kind heart, which matches the mortals’.There’s a lot of material here, and storytellers have used it over and over.Plus wasn’t there some reality show about a kindly angel who grants wishes togood people?To make the story fresh for today, how about creating a sortof anti-god who runs around doing stuff? Yeah, how bout a garbage collector whosnags broken toys from the rich neighborhood, fixes them up, and gives them tothe kids in the poor neighborhood? One day he’s got a cold, but he’s on thejob, and it’s extra miserable because the boss is being a bastard. Some little poorkid sees the garbage guy’s runny nose and dashes inside to bring him someorange juice. He might secretly reward that little kid for years, just because.The power differential is key here. What is true power?There’s material power: I can confer gifts to you. And there’s spiritual power:I can love you. Couldn’t we keep riffing on this for hours? Yeah. Take it away.I love you.What do you think?

{"title": "Story Writing Demo I", "date": "Thursday, January 28, 2016", "text": "Zestful Blog Post #143Aspiring fiction writers often are told by literary gurus to‘make use of’ fables, myths, and folklore. Why? Because, of course, the powerof those stories has stood the test of time. But as with so many otheradmonitions in writing instruction books, we’re left to our own devices as tohow, exactly, the hell to do it.In this case, I think a couple of examples—demonstrations,really—will be more helpful than some kind of theory with multiple steps and checkmarks. In You’ve Got a Book in You, Idemo the ‘hero’s adventure’ plot template, but there are many other usefulmyths and fables out there. Just for the heck of it, here are some ways to harnesstheir dynamism....speaking of power...Do you remember the Dog in the Manger? Aesop told of the dogwho lay in the manger filled with hay he couldn’t eat, and snapped at thecattle who tried to eat it, keeping them from their food. The moral is prettysimple: Some folks are spiteful and there’s nothing you can do about it.This one gets acted out in real life all the time. Amodern-day vandal, filled with envy at, say, someone else’s beautiful sportscar, takes a crowbar to it for the same sick satisfaction. I can’t have this,so to make myself feel better, I’ll ruin it for you. There’s a short-storybeginning right there, or a subplot in a longer work.In a more serious version, some guy, spurned by a woman,murders her so no one else can have her. Elvis and John Lennon sang hits basedon it: “I’d rather see you dead, little girl, than to be with another man.” (Fromthe song “Baby, Let’s Play House” by Arthur Gunter, 1954. Elvis covered it, andLennon used the line in “Run For Your Life.”) Think it through. This issupposed to be love? It’s not love for another, it’s narcissism. The myth ofNarcissus can take over at this point. That myth, however, is pretty short.Narcissus fell in love with his own reflection in a pool, and couldn’t tearhimself away from it even to eat or sleep. There he died, watching himself grow,one presumes, increasingly gaunt. But back to the Dog in the Manger. The keymotivating force for an author here is: What kind of person does these things?Is change possible? Revenge certainly is. But then things can escalate. You cansee where this can go, all the way up to world war.Here’s a romance: Beauty and the Beast. How to transfer thisone? A cocktail waitress falls for some shallow rich guy, while all along thebusboy quietly loves her and stands up for her against jackass customers andthe lecherous boss, etc. She takes him for granted, because he’s clumsy andunpolished. The turning point comes when the chips are down—she and the shallowrich guy (who’s cheating on his wife, naturally) get in a car wreck. He walksaway from it, while she’s in surgery for 15 hours and barely survives. He tellsthe police and his wife she was a hitchhiker, he’d never seen her before,that’s it. And the waitress never sees him again.It’s the humble busboy who visits her as she’s getting well,and tries to look after her. Her eyes pop open at some point, she perceives histrue worth and potential, and she falls in love with him. They get married,happy ending. For an extra-happy ending, it turns out they’re both secretinventors with little projects they’ve been working on. They put their twoideas together and voila, they have an important new thing, and overnight theybecome billionaires. Yay. Satisfaction.You could do this one with children on a playground. Withamoebae in a dish. With prisoners in a camp. With Winston Churchill and MarleneDietrich. Look at a myth. Look at real life. Then look at yourcharacters, or make up some new ones. Write it. Off the top of your head. Thisstuff seems simple, but it’s powerful.What do you think?

{"title": "Poor Fred", "date": "Thursday, January 21, 2016", "text": "Zestful Blog Post #142This post is about choices and their ramifications.Yesterday Marcia read to me a snippet from last Sunday’s NewYork Times (which sits around the house in increasing stages of decompositionthrough the week) about the editing process. Basically, the photo editors weretalking about how hard it is to select images to publish, from the thousandsthey have access to via their own photographers and the wire services. (I clingto the cool term ‘wire services,’ even though we all know the truth.) I waslike, yeah, tell me about it. I’d been there, even as a lowly reporter andphotographer for a local weekly paper. Which image tells the story best? Whatreally is the story in the first place? Moreover, which image tells the storyfrom the angle we want to tell it? Because there’s an angle to most every story.Then there’s the public and its appetites. Sensationalalways sells better. But when the public itself is being represented, theirstandards are quite different. Inclusion is what matters. I learned this quickly,just out of college, at the paper.One day the community theater troupe sent me tickets to itsupcoming production, some closed-room mystery play. I went to the dressrehearsal, took some pictures and interviewed the director, then attended openingnight. I wrote an enthusiastic article about the play and the players, and madeit into a big feature spread with two or three pictures.I heard nothing from the troupe after that, though. I wonderedif something was wrong; usually you get a note or a phone call of thanks forsuch nice publicity. By happenstance, I bumped into one of the actresses at thedrugstore and asked her what the troupe thought of the article.“Oh, yes,” she said sadly. “Poor Fred.”Turns out I had mentioned every single cast member in thearticle except the guy who played the cop who comes in and arrests everybody atthe end. He was in none of the pictures I ran. I think he had one or two lines.Fred was crushed that he’d been excluded from my coverage, AND THAT WAS ALLTHAT MATTERED.Then there was the children’s ice show. Having, believe itor not, taken a term of figure skating in college for physical education, I lacedup my skates and got out on the ice with the kids during a practice. I tooksome closeups and zooming action shots. A cluster of parents were watching,however, with increasing displeasure. They cornered me and demanded that I take off my damn skatesand climb up to the top of the bleachers while they got ALL the kids onto theice at one time. They wanted one group shot of all two hundred kids, so thatevery kid could “have their picture in the paper.”I obliged, thinking I might just run the good shots anyway. ButI didn’t; for some perverse reason I ran the group picture. The photo,reproduced on newsprint at about four by five inches, looked like a bunch of poppyseeds clustered on a white cake. I think I wanted to say to the parents, “There’syour group shot, and none of your kids are recognizable except as poppy seeds.”But I got no complaints. Had I been the New York Times, I would have run one ortwo of the good shots and to hell with what the parents want.The moral of the story is that scale matters. When readersoutweigh your subjects, you make one choice. When your subjects practicallyoutweigh your readers, you just might want to make a different choice. Thepublic is bloodthirsty when it comes to news about other people, but assensitive as a bouquet of orchids when it comes to themselves. You don’t haveto cater to that, and sometimes you can’t. But it is a choice.As writers, closeness to our subjects can be a blessing anda curse. One must harden oneself.What do you think?

{"title": "Defending Precise Language", "date": "Thursday, January 14, 2016", "text": "Zestful Blog Post #141When I make a mistake with language, I welcome beingcorrected. For instance, some time ago a reader of one of my Writer’s Digestarticles let me know that I’d misused the word ‘devolve.’ I’d used it as theopposite of ‘evolve,’ as in ‘things deteriorating / falling apart / going tohell,’ basically. It really means the transfer of something to a lower orfurther level. When the commander got shot, control of the vessel devolved to thelieutenant commander. The house devolved to the widow. I appreciated knowing mymistake, and have not made it since.But because many people make the same mistake I did, thewrong definition will probably become an accepted definition. Ref. my rant on descriptive-vs.-prescriptivedictionary entries in Zestful Post #103.Not everyone appreciates being corrected, however, and thishas always surprised me. I used to have a boss who asked me to proofread hisweekly staff memos. One time I pointed out that he’d misspelled ‘supersede.’ He’dmade the common error of spelling it ‘supercede.’ He argued with me, thenfinally grabbed the dictionary (pre-desktop PCs) to check. He was so angry. I’dbeen respectful; it isn’t as if I’d called him an idiot. This same boss alsoused the word prone to mean supine, and employed the phrase ‘throw the baby outwith the bathwater’ when he meant ‘put all your eggs in one basket.’ I stoppedcorrecting him after supersede, though.Word meanings fade and morph as cultures change, of course.I’ve noticed the phrase ‘marking time’ is increasingly used to mean keepingtrack of time, as in checking off the days on a calendar. Did you know it’s actuallya military term that means to march in place? As such, it’s also correctly usedas a metaphor for wasting time or not making progress. I think more Americans knewthe meaning during and after WWII, when so many people were more familiar with militaryculture, either being in the service themselves or being close to a servicemember.‘Penultimate’ is another good one. Many folks use it to meanlike, man, super-ultimate, the livin’ end, you know? Actually it meanssecond-to-last. Ultimate, of course, means last or final. Ultimately, wedecided to go to the movies. The penultimate letter of the alphabet is Y.Then there’s pronunciation, which is essentially hopeless. Iremember pronouncing the word ‘flaccid’ correctly (flak-sid) in conversationwith a friend, who began finding ways to use the same word but pronouncing it ‘flassid’as most people do, thinking she was subtly giving me the hint that I’d beensaying it wrong.Think about it. We don’t say someone had a car assident, orhas a French assent, or is essentric because he wears a derby. It’s flak-sid,goddam it.Defenders of precise language, unite!And finally, happy birthday to my friend Special K.What do you think?

This time I’m trying to be fast and ruthless, because there’s so muchon my wanna-do list.I quit my part-time lifeguard job. I’d wanted to keep it upfor a year, but decided six months is good enough.

The aquatics director would love to have me back.I think I’ll keep up my certifications just in case. The hours I would havespent guarding, I’ll spend writing and perhaps learning new things.

{"title": "Work-Arounds", "date": "Thursday, December 31, 2015", "text": "Zestful Blog Post #139Big-ass storms sweep over Washington’s Olympic Peninsula alot. They like to knock down trees. Back when Marcia and I were living in thedeep woods there, we had to make shift without electricity many times, once fora whole winter week. (A woodstove and well-stocked shed solve many problems.) During one such outage, I hiked into our neighbors’ woods towatch a work crew, whose truck I’d heard rumble up the rough road we shared.The guys’ problem was a large dead hemlock that had fallenacross the power line, which stretched from the lower road straight up througha steep, thickly forested hillside. The tree hadn’t ripped the line down; itwas hanging on it, fifty yards from the road. No way could the guys get their cherry-pickertruck down there to lift the tree off; they’d have to wallow down the slope withtheir chainsaws. Having felled trees myself, I knew the perils of hangingtimber, and wondered how the hell they were going to cut up that tree safely.It seemed impossible.[A different large hemlock, but you get the idea. This one didn't pause, but just ripped down the electric and phone lines on its way to block our garage, along with a fragrant cedar.]They solved the dangerous problem in less than a minute. Theyeased the truck next to the pole that supported the line as it crossed the road.One guy went up in the basket, reached up with a jaws-of-life-looking tool, andsimply cut the line. It whanged, and the tree crashed to the ground. The otherguy scampered down the slope and retrieved the line. They had the son of abitch spliced and back on the pole in five more minutes. They rumbled down theroad, flipped the circuit at the main pole, and left. I just stood there absorbing the brilliant work-around thatfor them was routine.My New Year’s resolution is to figure out as manywork-arounds as possible, in my own life and work, so as to save time and bebrilliant. Gotta look beyond obvious solutions; I think the key will be tofirst BELIEVE that more than one solution might exist.p.s. Thanks to my buddy Steve for prompting my thoughts onthis.

Is that ahumblebrag right there? It is, it is! I’m sorry. Hopeless situation. Here’s myissue today: Charities and those who give or serve have the dilemma of tellingabout the giving vs. not telling. If you tell, it seems boastful, yet perhaps bytelling one can prompt others to give. If you don’t tell, you’re safe from anyboast accusations, yet by keeping it secret you relinquish the possibility of suggestingthe idea to others.What the hell. After I post this, I’m off to donate blood. Ido this regularly; I got the email a few days ago notifying me that I’meligible again; I decided to schedule my donation on Christmas Eve day. Myreasons, actually, are selfish: The donation center is unlikely to be crowded,and I can eat large portions of Christmas fest food for a couple of days withthe perfect excuse of having to build my life juices up again. Plus, OK, yes, it feels more special to do it today.Donating blood, if your health permits, is such an easy wayto give a gift no one can buy.

{"title": "Direct Experience", "date": "Thursday, December 17, 2015", "text": "Zestful Blog Post #137Here’s a blog post by new friend Alan Spector, who gotinspired by one of my recent Writer’s Digest articles (on making a newcommitment to your writing). He believes getting out of your comfort zone andgoing for something special is important for retirees too. Yeah! Here’s also a link to a historical novel he’s written andpublished.What’s stepping out of your comfort zone really about? Twothings: One, it’s about keeping your comfort zone comfortable. Think abouteasing into your nice soft sleeping bag after a hard day of mountain hiking.Ah, bliss. Now think about lying in your sleeping bag for days on end. Comfortevaporates. Muscles atrophy. Only by periodically leaving that comfort can youmaintain that comfort. Paradox, yeah. Zen, yeah.The other thing: leaving your comfort zone is the only wayyou can gain new direct experience. Who has a stake in this? I remember arguingwith one of my grad school professors about sleeping out under the stars. Thequestion was, do you need to experience something in order to fully appreciateit? She, who had never spent a night in the open, contended that you can read abook about being outdoors in the woods and have as much feeling for the naturalworld as if you’d actually experienced it firsthand. I, who had slept on mountainsides without shelter, contended theopposite. And you can only know the difference if you’ve gone out and done the experience, whatever it is, dammit. It’s great to love books, and books can bring the outer world alive, butonly to a point.It’s essential for the writersof books to go out and gain direct experience, so they can write about itconvincingly—so the experience can inform their work. This is true even for writers of sci-fi and fantasy. I think I’d like to explain and digdeeper into that soon.What do you think?

{"title": "Three Buds", "date": "Thursday, December 10, 2015", "text": "Zestful Blog Post #136The most recent two issues of Writer’s Digest magazineinclude articles by me. November/December contains “Make a New Commitment toYour Writing,” which has moved more readers to get in touch with me, either viaemail or social media, than any other piece I’ve written for the magazine inthe ten years I’ve been doing it. The article is a bouquet of encouragement,drawn from my insights, woes, and successes. From the response, I realize thatwhile writers can always use help with technique, they thirst as much or morefor help with heart and guts. Here’s one of my favorite passages from the article:Rekindle the spark by simply movingfull-on into the unknown. Whatever you doubt you can do on the page, choosethat thing. In our increasingly cautious world, “For the hell of it,” has toooften been replaced by “Better not.” It’s up to artists—that is, you—to throwaway caution and leap. You might attain remarkable new heights.I want to keep helping writers this way.[For the hell of it: trying to fit into a mockup ofthe Mercury capsule at NASA. Real dimensions. The Mercury 7 astronauts all wereshorter than me. The thing is terrifyingly tiny. This is the best I could dofor an illustration for this post.]The January issue features a more workmanlike piece: “PowerTools,” which shows how to use arc and pace to fix just about any problem infiction writing. And here’s an excerpt:Often dialogue doesn’t work becausethe author was afraid to move too fast. But fiction, almost as much as stagedrama, relies on dialogue for vigor and movement.Arc and pace together, wheninjected into dialogue, can transform it from weak to strong. In fact, a smalldialogue exchange can have a microarc all its own:“No, because I don’t think you cankeep a secret.”“Oh, yes I can! Try me.”I just turned in a chapter for a new Writer’s Digest book ondialogue, set to come out in 2016. My assignment was to write something on internaldialogue, or the inner voices of characters. It’s funny, I’ve alwaysrepresented my characters’ thoughts intuitively, but researching and writingthe chapter made me realize how complex the whole thing can get, when you tryto nail down absolutes. For instance, is this passage in present tense or past?:I should hold up that liquor storetonight, he thought.Truly, you can argue that one both ways. And truly, it doesn’tmatter! If you have a basic grasp of how it works, you can’t go far wrong. Allyou really need to attend to is consistency. For instance, if you use the aboveconstruction in a story, you should not later use something like this:I’ve got it made now, he thinks.Once you see it explained, you’ve got it.What do you think?

When one is a blogger and something big just happened and is all overthe news and social media, one sometimes wonders whether to comment. I thinkmany bloggers, no matter what their specialty, figure if they don’t comment onwhatever the big news is, readers will think they’re out of touch or don’tcare. I’m in touch, I care, and I have opinions, but I choose not to comment.The very best one can do is choose peace for one’s own heartat whatever the cost. And there is a cost to choosing peace. The price isrelinquishing the grievance narrative, dropping the need to grasp and struggle,and embracing humility. Which also means not trying to fix other people.

Great for kids needing summer jobs, which we all were,except for the head cashier, who was a hardbitten, chain-smoking redhead whohad a crush on the owner, who, she regularly and mournfully informed us, didn’t even know she existed.Which was bullshit, because without her the place would havecollapsed. But we knew what she meant.I have many fascinating stories about unloading watermelons(human chain; if you drop one you have to cram the pieces down the sewer asfast as possible before Ronnie sees); grading peaches (a job to be foisted offto a rookie employee after the peaches are four days old, because yuck); andmore.Later I spent ten years selling books, a year-round jobwhere I learned all about Black Friday and the Christmas rush (as it used to becalled). A butt-busting time of year, but fun too, because everybody on staffgot into the spirit of the season while being able to justifiably whine abouthow hard it all was. Boy, did we sell books.Every year around this time I think of retail, and givethanks that I don’t work it anymore. I give thanks to you, my friends, myreaders, and to and all three of my family groups (birth, law, and chosen).In the spirit of giving, thought I should give away somee-books in honor of Black Friday, just for the hell of it, you know. Somehow Holy Hell presented itself in my mind,dunno why. So yeah, the first in the Lillian Byrd series is free on Amazon through the weekend.

{"title": "Breaking the Rules of POV", "date": "Thursday, November 19, 2015", "text": "Zestful Blog Post #133Recently I got three inquiries in a row from aspiringwriters wanting advice on point of view in fiction, specifically shifting POVfrom one character to another, and even more specifically, mixing first-personPOV with other styles—third person limited and omniscient: can we do it? shouldwe do it? how do we do it? (Thank you to D, J, and E for giving me the idea forthis post.)The novels of my first series (LillianByrd crime) are all in first person, which has its joys. The reader gets toknow the main character intimately—if you’ve done your job well—and the limitationsof the form can help shape your plot. One character can’t know everything,which automatically introduces an element of suspense. I chose first person formy first books because I was told by some magazine article (probably &ironically in Writer’s Digest magazine) that all first novelists should use it,because at least then you can’t screw up POV.LOL.Alternatively, writing gurus often tell new authors to stickwith one style of POV: pick either first, third-limited, or omniscient, andstay there. Yet messing around with POV is interesting, and it can bejust the thing for your story. Yet it’s fraught.In many novels old and new, an omniscient narrator tells thestory, shifting frequently from one character’s viewpoint to the next. If donewell, we get not only a literal unfolding of the story, but also the characters’inner worldview—their thoughts and judgments as to what’s going on. But thenarrator becomes a bit of a character as well, which can be helpful orannoying, depending on the skill of the author.For The Actress (RitaFarmer mysteries) I wanted more flexibility than simple first person, becausemy story was more ambitious, wider ranging, with more characters. Yet I likedthe intimacy of first person. So I looked around to see if any novels mixedfirst with third limited and/or omniscient and found a few that worked (don’task me; I forget), so I figured I could do it too.Yet I hated reading novels where the POV sticks with onecharacter for almost the whole book, but shifts quickly and inexplicably toanother character’s POV as a way out of plot jams, which is cheap. Suddenly—gosh!—welearn what the bad guy’s thinking, just at the exact moment we need anexplanation of what the hell his motivation is. Then we’re back to the hero forthe duration. In such cases, shifting POV is a way to avoid telling the storywith discipline and fluidity. And it’s pure plain jangling to readers. It’sespecially bad when readers constantly have to re-orient themselves to rapidlyshifting limited POVs. Note I say limited: This is worse than just choosingomniscient, which imposes its own demands of reason and plausibility.So I structured TheActress to begin from the perspective of Rita, my protagonist, and to shiftPOV only at major breaks. Sometimes it’s a chapter break, other times it’s amid-chapter shift from one scene and set of characters to another. I carriedthe same pattern into the other two Rita books. By On Location I was pretty comfortable with it.Currently I’m writing a final draft of a novel told in a mixof third limited and omniscient; no first person. It happens in Los Angeles, itinvolves a retired schoolteacher, her illiterate (and undocumented) cleaningwoman, and a gang of corporate saboteurs. It digs into why people help oneanother, why they betray one another, and how far into the abyss they will gofor money—and sometimes love. The title is Crimesin a Second Language.Bottom line answer to the questions on mixing POVs: Yes, wecan do it. We should do it IF the story demands, or at least prompts it. Keepyour artistic integrity handy and never shift POV to get yourself out of atight place you’ve gotten yourself into. When mixing first with third limited /omniscient, do it sparingly.Moreover, don’t be cowed by the process. Relax, jump in, andgive it a try.What do you think?

It’s also in honor of you, myreader, and yes, my friend.Here’s the whole of it. When a marvelous human being toosoon leaves the building for good, we grieve hard. Then we have to figure outwhat to do next. If we lose our joy, that’s letting cancer—or whatever diseaseor disaster—win. If we focus on disbelief, if we keep insisting things ought tobe the way they were before, that’s making that person as gone as can be. It’s givingdeath everything.To change darkness into light:When you do your best work, smile, because she’s right therewith you, because she did her best work.When you speak and behave honestly and kindly, feel happy,because she did so.When you make an effort to understand—to really extendyourself—be joyful, because she did so.When you do anything your beloved person did, with integrityand a true heart, laugh, because she or he is there with you.When youact like a goof;taste/smell/touch/hear/see something that person liked;get out for a walk or a jog or a swim;create something for the hell of it;make a mistake (yes, of course);try to fix something;be joyful, because.I said to Marcia the other night as we grieved our friends, “Iguess the pie of life is like this: half work, half love, and half chocolate.”Don’t start with me about math.Time gets us all. But it can’t steal our joy. So do the worknow. Give more love now. And don’t forget the chocolate.What do you think?

{"title": "When to Ship It", "date": "Thursday, October 29, 2015", "text": "Zestful Blog Post #130Recently I talked to a group of university students aboutwriting. One of the students asked the best question I’ve heard in a long time:“How do you know when it’s finished?” She was expressing the classic artist’sdilemma, which stretches all the way back to the auroch-painting paleos.If you’re a craftsman, you have a pretty clear idea of whenyour project is done: The chair is plumb and square, the finish is smooth, aperson will buy it and sit in it. Yes, you could decide to add some decoration,and you could argue that furniture making is art as well as craft. OK, fine,but my point still stands up pretty well when you consider that a piece ofcraftsmanship must, by any definition, have a function.A painter, sculptor, or writer dwells in a different world.You create something which, unlike furniture, has no measurable function. Youtrade in emotional currency. Your standards of quality and effectiveness areentirely your own. Therefore there’s no empirical way to measure when a pieceof art is finished. But there is a way to know when it’s finished.Here’s the progression: You get to a point where you havesome semblance of a whole. You see flaws, and you fix them. You revise andbuff. You breathe on it and rub it with your sleeve and see your reflection. OK, good. But still you wonder, and you start to feelanxious. Could it be better? If so, how? Maybe I should try this. Or that. Butwhat if I ruin it? Every novice art student has ruined a drawing by overworkingit. Writers have done the same, though we rarely realize it.So, the secret: When you’re unsure of whether or how itcould be better, when you feel that nasty sense of anxiety building—that’s whenit’s done.And you ship it. You send it to your professional editor, oryou begin querying agents and publishers, or you put it into the world yourselfwith confidence that your product is solid. You might get expert feedback thatmakes sense to you, especially once you’ve been away from the project for awhile. Then you can revise with purpose and steady nerve.Either way, you’re good. At some more or less comfortablepoint (yeah, nothing’s ever perfect), you’ll declare victory and move on.What do you think?

I asked what she thought it was all for. Sadly, shesaid, “Well, to have as much fun as possible, I guess.”But that’s only part of it, isn’t it? To me, it seems themost important thing is to contribute something—while having fun along the way.One can make others happy by being a clean, clear spirit who doesn’t haularound dissatisfaction and tension. That’s a contribution, a huge contribution.One can bring up wonderful children. One can create, and get those creationsinto the world.Can one be a jerk—even a monster—and still create marvelousthings? Sure. But being creative doesn’t excuse living dirty.Clearing away the trash, dropping heavy baggage, refusing toget pulled down by the mundane, putting good work out there, being kind,persisting in the face of pain and death—those things are an artist’s job.

{"title": "Getting Paid to Play", "date": "Thursday, October 15, 2015", "text": "Zestful Blog Post #128Symphony season has started up again, with all itschallenges and profound joys. I play the timpani in the South Shore Symphony Orchestra, a young, semiprofessional ensemble that will give concertsthis season in Sun City Center and Carrollwood, Florida. (Local friends: firstconcert is a 2 p.m. matinee this Sunday, Oct. 18 at the UCC in Sun City Center.)The musicians receive a percentage of ticket sales, and that's unusual. So far,the pay amounts to hamburger-and-gas-money. But having played in orchestraswhere every key person—conductor, executive director, owners of concert venues,program printers—gets paid except themusicians, this makes me happy.See, somehow the deal is that musicians are supposed toplay for the love of it, and we should even feel a little dirty accepting moneyfor a job well done. Creative types work for nothing all over the place, and itseems a given that everybody’s supposed to be OK with it. But I say to hellwith that. If the marketplace will yield up money for your efforts, you oughtto get a fair share.Because the money is a symbol of respect. In the case of the performing arts, many organizations relyon donations besides ticket sales, and boards of directors and volunteers servefor no pay, which the performers should rightly appreciate. It all depends onpopularity: “The Lion King” rakes in big bucks, “Turandot” doesn’t cover costs.That’s a fact of the marketplace as well.As for authors, we’re actually in a pretty good positionthese days. You can get a publishing contract with a royalty schedule, or youcan self-publish and keep control and the profits. Yet writers have manyopportunities to give it away: to news and gossip aggregators, literaryjournals, and so forth. Even social media amounts to unpaid contribution ofcontent. [Part of the large percussion array required for the upcoming SSSO concert…]The trick is to figure whether the free exposure will do youenough good to justify the effort. The prestigious literary journals, most of whichpay nothing, are routinely read by major players in the publishing business. Apiece on a high profile pop culture web site might get valuable notice as well.Sometimes, of course, you don’t know, and it’s a crapshoot.But with the growing number of ways authors and othercreators can reach and build an audience, I feel we should husband our talentsand output and make sterner choices about how and where to release ourmaterial.It’s better to get paid to play.Announcements!:- My friend Jessica Strawser, editor in chief of Writer’sDigest magazine, is going to be a debut hardcover novelist!

This one contains areprint of my “21 Suspense Hacks” article from the magazine. Coincidentally, this morning somebody at WD tweeted aboutthe article, and my inbox got filled with notices of nice people retweeting it. Thank you!I love this article, because I was able to do what I lovemost: remember great stories, reread some, analyze them, and then write what Ithink. I used examples from Edgar Allan Poe to Charles Portis (a severelyunderread and underrated author, in spite of the 47-year-old success of True Grit, a novel I consider one of thegreatest gifts any author ever gave to the world) (the movie/s don’t do justiceto the incredibly witty and nimble prose of the book; the movie/s are fermentedvulture dung compared with the book), Mary Renault, Aesop, Agatha Christie,Stephen King, and even God.What kind of suspense did God write? Well, in the Bible ittells us that he kicked the angel Lucifer out of heaven (for cause). Rightthere, you have this banished, injured party. What do we think—that Lucifer’sgonna just slink away and never be heard from again? Hell, no! And therein liesthe suspense. If you have a banished angel in chapter one, you know you’regoing to put a vengeful son of a bitch later in the book. You just have to.I can’t tell you how much I love to write articles for thatmagazine. Each one is a combination of essay and research paper, which, hey, Iactually went to school for. Usually, I pitch ideas for articles to the editor,and she says yea or nay.But last week an editor for WD Books got in touch asking foran original chapter for a book on dialogue they’re putting together for nextyear. They’re reprinting some other stuff of mine, and this new piece needs tobe about internal, or interior, dialogue. I said yes—yes being the right answerfor pretty much every question in the universe—and now I’m thinking about it.How cool is that? 2,500 words on how characters think, essentially. How great authorshave represented that, how to do it, mistakes to avoid.[BTW, vultures seem to have an entire repertoire of nefarious deeds.]Two days ago I went on an airplane journey. There’s always apoint during the flight, after my nerves settle down from all the airportzaniness, after I’ve done the crossword in the puke-pocket magazine, where there’s like this mellow window of creativity, and I write. I wrote general ideasabout this article, and I realized what a meta subject internal dialogue is.Rightly, of course, it’s internal monologue, not dialogue. But you have thecharacter reflecting, thinking, making judgments, and those judgments are notalways what the character puts out to the world. That’s part of a great writer’sart.Isn’t it cool, just to be able to think and write about this stuff? Whatwould you like me to address in this article?

{"title": "The Value of OPO", "date": "Thursday, October 1, 2015", "text": "Zestful Blog Post #126When I was coming up as a writer I was wary of critiquegroups, and still am, even though I’m occasionally paid to lead them. (Thispost is on the heels of doing a day-long one at a conference last week, which makes all this fresh in my mind.)For the uninitiated, a writing critique group is whereeverybody submits an agreed-upon amount of writing in advance, and everybodycomments on everybody else’s work. Some groups don’t read in advance, but readsilently or aloud on the spot.Such groups, a.k.a. other people’s opinions (OPO), arefraught with peril. Some of your fellow writers may:- be kind of dumb and thus don’t get your stuff;- have different tastes from you, and thus don’t get yourstuff;- be needy, argumentative, not nice, ‘and exetera,’ as thekids in my neighborhood used to say.All that may be. But there is gold for the mining in suchgroups:- Any reading-aloud that is done (especially by someone notthe author) instantly and pretty much empirically reveals awkward wording;- Patterns of opinion generally emerge, which if you’reopen, can help you make decisions about anything from content to theme tostyle;- If one or more accomplished, or particularly astute,writers are present, you can improve how you think about literature: how toevaluate it, perceive strengths and weaknesses, and figure out solutions toproblems;- You’re forced to separate yourself from your workemotionally if not intellectually. Writers who can’t do this are doomed. Somewriters find critique groups too upsetting, so they self-select out of them. I’mnot saying if you don’t like crit groups you’re doomed; just that well-adjustedwriters learn to deal with criticism calmly and rationally.[This writer showed up wayoverdressed for critique group day.]Crit groups are not for everyone, and not everyone comesaway with the exact same gains or lack of. But that’s life: it ain’t alwaysfair, but if you stay open come hell or high water, trust the process, extendyourself to others, and persist, you’ll be all right.What do you think?

Because it’s true; it’s always hard. But here’s the thing,also true: There is unquenchable thirst for great story out there. Humans willnever stop wanting, needing, craving, story. That’s the beauty of being astoryteller—whether a camp counselor who wants to send them to bed tremblingafter the bonfire, or a  novelistdreaming of greatness.I write these words on the eve of meeting with nine aspiringauthors in St. Augustine at the Florida Heritage Writers Conference. We’ll meetin the cool kids’ room at the exquisite Markham House on the Flagler Collegecampus. Everybody’s read everybody else’s first ten pages and written critiques.We’ll all discuss the work one at a time, together. I’ll give it everything I’vegot. And we will all learn.When I was a young girl, I sat next to my mother watchingOlympics gymnastics on TV. Stirred, I said, “I’d like to do that!” She said,without even thinking much, “Oh, the chances of making it are so low.”I meant I’d like to tumble and fly like those girls did. Shethought I meant I wanted to be on the Olympics team, stand on the platform andget a medal. She wanted to quash that ambition right away, because so fewwho try, make it onto the world stage. Why set the kid up for heartbreak? Shethought she was doing me a favor. But that’s a terrible way to react to a child’simpulse, or dream. (All loving respect to her memory.)It’s a fine, but clear, distinction. I never did pursuegymnastics. Just as well, because my body was wrong for it—too spindly, too tall.But she couldn’t dissuade me from writing, and later fromquitting a lucrative corporate job to try to earn a much more meager livingfrom writing. No matter what negativity I got from her, I kept on in some fashion orother, too compelled to give up. Which is really all there is to it. If you’redestined to do it, you’ll keep at it, whatever the externals, whatever the outcome.You haveno choice.And that’s beautiful. Let it flower. Open. Audiences await.What do you think?

{"title": "3 Tips for Choosing Deadlines", "date": "Thursday, September 10, 2015", "text": "Zestful Blog Post #123For professional writers, deadlines are a fact of life.Fortunately, they’ve never daunted me. But I’ve learned a few tricks along theway.Deadlines fall into two categories: Those imposed on you,and those you have occasion to impose on others. The first kind are set byemployers, clients, agents, editors, publishers, etc. Sometimes a deadline isnot negotiable. Daily newspapers pretty much have non-negotiable deadlines. Ifyou’re writing freelance, your editor has probably told you a deadline that’s afew hours earlier than the real one, but if you want to keep a goodrelationship with that editor, you get your piece and pictures in on time.[You want all of your business relationships to be happy rainbows,not crushed raccoons like the one by the side of the road I Photoshopped out.]But sometimes, as for a magazine article or a short storyfor an anthology, you can have a say in your deadline. The conversation mightgo:You: So, when do you need this by?Editor: Well, ideally I’d like it by [X date], but [Z datelater] would be OK.You: Let’s split the difference. How bout [Y date]? Wouldthat really be all right with you?Because something always comes up, and you’re going to beglad for those extra days. So:Tip #1: Pad it if you can, but not by a lot. You wantbreathing room, but you don’t want the job to drag on forever. Plus, bosseslike it when you make their lives easier.Tip #2: Never, if you can help it, choose a deadline thatfalls on a Monday. Once you’ve made that mistake and paid for it by sacrificingweekend plans, you’ll never make it again. I like Thursday deadlines.Both of those tips work when you have to impose deadlines aswell, like if you’re editing something or arranging for production work to bedone, like design and printing.One more thing, for longer-term deadlines months away, likeyour next book for your publisher. This also works if you’re the requester ofwork, like if you’re editing a collection or suchlike:Tip #3: Never choose a date at the beginning of a month. Ifyou do that, everybody’s like, oh, yeah, we have until February 1st toget that done. And they think Februaryall the way through January, until suddenly it’s like, “Ruh-roh, tomorrow’s February,and it’s not just February, its February 1st, and we’ve screwedourselves.” But if you pick January 31st, everybody at least startsto bear down in January. “Oh, yeah, January deadline on this one.”All of this works for self-imposed deadlines as well. It’sall psychological, but real.What do you think?

{"title": "This Should Make You Feel Better", "date": "Thursday, September 3, 2015", "text": "Zestful Blog Post #122The other day I was listening to a published author complainabout various aspects of our business, like we’re supposed to do social media,blog, write a book every two months, not mind that some jackass who writescruddy books is really famous and rich, etc. And yeah, one is entitled tocomplain about anything and everything. But it got me to thinking about mycontacts in show business, and how they have it worse than any author who everlived.I’m talking about actors and actresses who are not householdnames, who haven’t played romantic leads, who haven’t won Oscars, but who goout on auditions every day and pretty much take any role they’re offered, be ita character modeling job for an ad photo shoot or a part in a commercial, TVshow, or feature film. The journeymen and -women out there who put together aliving, sometimes a good living, but sometimes they’re on unemployment.A favorite story is when I asked an actress friend of mineabout the proverbial ‘casting couch’.[It’s a couch, but it’s the wrong color.]I’d noticed, when spooking around casting studios doing research for The Actress, that eachand every separate studio had a black leather couch on chrome legs, upon whichwould sit the producer, director, casting director, assistant, and whoeverelse, in various combinations, to watch the auditions. It was so remarkably consistent:almost identical black leather couches, in casting studios all across Los Angeles.Which prompted me to ask about the you know, casting couch.My (gorgeous) friend said, “Here’s how it works today. You go to an audition,and the director and everybody are there. You do the audition and they tell you,very nice, thank you very much. Afterward, your agent doesn’t get a call; youdo. You get a call on your personal cell phone, and it’s the director, and hesays, ‘You did a wonderful job yesterday in the audition! By the way, I’m goingup to San Francisco this weekend. Would you like to come?’”I asked if she ever said yes.“No. If you do, there’s no end to it.”Disrespect seems to be the order of business. “They f*ck with you because they can,” said one friend, who had gotten jerked around doing a seven-second shot in a commercial shoot, asked to do it oneway, then another, then another, then another. Seven seconds.Incompetence comes up as well. An actor acquaintance related how he was the principal actor in a TV commercial that was shot overtwo days. He had been asked to bring his own wardrobe of khaki pants and poloshirt, which he did. After the first day’s shoot, he asked if he needed tobring the same pants tomorrow. The director told him no, just bring the shirt, becausethe next shots would all be from the waist up.But when he arrived at the next day’s shoot wearing blackpants, they were like, no, man, you’ve got to have the same pants as yesterday!The director had been wrong; they needed to retake some full-length shots. Gohome and get em! The film studio was in Santa Monica. This poor bastard livedin Pasadena, 25 miles away. If you have even a passing knowledge of LosAngeles, its traffic patterns and population, you know he was in for probablyat least two hours of driving, sitting in traffic, dealing with alternateroutes around whichever crashes du jour, etc. He was like, can’t wardrobe comeup with something here? And they were like no, you miserable nitwit. Go!Another time I arrived to have lunch with an actor friend athis house, to find him on the phone, feverishly trying to come up with a jestercostume he could borrow from somebody. Because yeah, you’re supposed to costumeyourself for auditions (and sometimes even roles, as above), and he wanted thisjester role in a commercial, auditions tomorrow. Nobody had an outfit he could borrow.Did he want to rent one for $200? No, man. I believe in the end he bought ajester hat, nailed the audition, and got the part.It’s a jungle out there.I’ve never heard of an author being offered a publishingcontract in exchange for, well, going along on that weekend to San Francisco,though I suppose it’s not beyond imagination. But really, when we think we haveit tough, let’s just remember our friends in Hollywood. May they get residualsfor life. And always bring the khaki pants, just in case.Now for some publishing news from pals around:Tate Volino, a new local friend, just sent me a copy of hisbook The Front Nine, a collection ofshort stories on the golf world. From a first look, I can see the authenticity—behindthe scenes at a private club, for instance.Peter Frickel, another local buddy (with a fabulous SouthAfrican voice), has been busy publishing on Amazon, most recently Lilies of the Vlei and River, both set in his native continentof Africa.From Christina Gross, one of my friends from Port Angeles,here’s Rescue the Innocent, ageopolitical thriller with an intriguing plot.Lastly, buddy BJ Phillips landed a publishing contract withDesert Palm Press for her novel HurricaneSeason.

{"title": "Master Class", "date": "Thursday, August 27, 2015", "text": "Zestful Blog Post #121When you work at home it’s important to get out of the housenow and then. Yesterday Marcia and I went to the Salvador Dali museum in St.Petersburg to see the special M.C. Escher exhibit. As I posted on Facebook and Twitter (yeah, cripe,I actually sent out a couple of real-time tweets), Escher was one of myartistic heroes in college. Indeed, I’m sure his precise methods andmind-blowing illusions are still popular with lots of college kids. Anybodyelse remember that black-light poster version of ‘Three Spheres’?The exhibit, on loan through Jan. 3 from the Herakleidon inGreece (yeah, I wonder too) shed more light on Escher for me. I hadn’t known or remembered that he’d been born (1898) intoa rich Dutch family, who helped support him as he worked to develop his skillsand market his work. He married, had kids, and kept working.Yesterday Ilearned that it took him THIRTY YEARS to get his income high enough to supporthis family adequately. During this time he was frequently depressed due to hislack of financial success. One might expect that he shouldn’t have gottendownhearted, because hey, his parents were behind him, and his kids wereassured of food, school shoes, and summer camp.But I can relate. Anyone who has tried to earn anindependent living from art can relate. (Anybody else thinking of Van Goghright now?) You want to succeed, and income is a sign that your art is makingthe full circle it’s supposed to make: from you to the consumer, then back toyou to make more. Serious artists the world over feel this urgency.So don’t ever feel greedy or shabby if you yearn for yourart to pay off. It means you care.[I always attempt to copy something whenever I go to a museum. My efforts pale in comparison, but I learn something every time. Here I tried to represent the subtle difference of light: It’s falling on the upper edges of the leaf, making them slightly brighter, and leaving the lower edges darker.]Another thing. Escher loved Italy; he met his wife there,had a child, and found great inspiration in the country’s landscapes. Butthings got bad under Mussolini. In 1935 Escher moved his family to Switzerland, wherehis kids wouldn’t be forced to march around in quasi-military uniforms carryingdummy guns. The wintry Swiss landscape felt desolate to him, and hisart withered. Until, that is, he decided he’d better stop mourning Italy andlook within for inspiration. This triggered his work with plane division, tessellation,and dimensional illusion. And that is what made him a rock star in his ownlifetime.A profound lesson.What do you think?

{"title": "Stuff That Bugs Me, Vol. II", "date": "Thursday, August 20, 2015", "text": "Zestful Blog Post #120Point 1:When I was little and just developing my powers of reason, I’dtry to argue with my mother over some abominable requirement, like bedtime atseven-thirty. As all children do, I pointed out that she didn’t have to follow the rule.“An exception proves the rule,” she’d say smugly, and thatwas the end of it.I’d stand there uneasy and baffled, not yet able to expressthat what she said didn’t make sense. I figured it was some adult, mysticalwisdom I’d eventually get the combo to someday.But here I am, knowing better, yet I keep hearing people usethat phrase to excuse or justify whatever contradiction they prefer. God damn it.[This is me, busily tilting at sloppy usage.]The real roots of the phrase are ancient. In Roman law, thephrase meant that an exception demonstrates that a rule exists. It did not meanthat an exception confirms the rule. But also, one of the several meanings of theword ‘prove’ means to test, or more crudely, find fault with. When you read forproof, you are looking for mistakes.So, logically, an exception invalidates the rule. Therefore, children should be permitted tostay up until “Lost in Space” is over.Point 2:If I hear or read one more news item like, “The report saidthe cause of the fire was arson, which begs the question: Who would benefitfrom the loss?,” I’ll run screaming into the desert. Then I’ll shoot myself inthe head while throwing myself off a cliff. That should bring me peace, at last.‘Begs the question’ is the term for a type of fallacy thatcan also be called circular reasoning. It takes for granted that which is beingargued for. Example: I know this document is true because the document says it’strue.It is nonsensical to use the term ‘begs the question’ whenone means ‘prompts the question.’ In fairness, I have in recent months noticed somejournalists getting it right. It’s such a great day when I don’t have to dropwhat I’m doing and sprint into the desert, carrying my .357 magnum and lookingfor a cliff.What do you think?

{"title": "A Drafty Vault", "date": "Thursday, August 6, 2015", "text": "Zestful Blog Post #118The current issue of Writer’s Digest magazine(August/September 2015) features an article by yours truly called “What RealRevision Looks Like.” My idea was to Show Not Tell aspiring authorsdifferent ways to revise, by printing before-and-after excerpts from my ownpublished novels. At 4,000 words, it’s the longest piece I’ve ever done for themagazine, and it was a lot of fun, in spite of the heavy lifting required.[The dining-room table looked like this for a while.]Yes, I literally had to do some lifting, in order toretrieve and go through the early rough drafts of my novels, hunting forpassages that would illustrate, when compared with the finished, publishedproduct, how to recognize manuscript problems and fix them, using elements ofgood fiction.I do possess the original handwritten drafts of all my booksexcept for the first, Holy Hell. Thevery earliest pages of that one I threw out at some point during the 1990s,when I had typed a version onto a diskette (yeah, techno, baby), had minimalstorage space in my apartment, and the belief that it would be vain and insaneand bad karma to think the manuscript would someday have any historical/scholarlyvalue. But I did some heavy rewriting of it later, and discovered thosehandwritten pages in the vault. The vault is the place where our house trollslive, beneath the stairs. The manuscripts are in cardboard manuscript boxesstacked in plastic storage totes. None of this is archival, but oh well.Authors, even minor ones, are supposed to keep their original documents andbequeath them to an appropriate archive. I’ve not made this bequest yet,believing it would be vain and insane and bad karma to think my manuscriptswill someday have historical/scholarly value. About 10 years ago I read amagazine article that told about some archive that was (at least then) payingordinary published authors thousands of dollars, like 10 or 15K, for each oftheir first drafts they wanted to sell. I don’t know if that’s still real.Like many living authors, the thought that somebody maywrite their PhD thesis on my work someday is both flattering and disturbing.The dead ones could care less. But hey, how many analyses of Shakespeareanslang can the Library of Congress keep track of?At any rate, it was fun revisiting those old pages—seeing thereams’-worth of yellow pads I used, the different inks—Pelikan Brown looks goodagainst goldenrod paper—from my varied fountain pens and nibs. I mourn the factthat Waterman changed the name of its beautiful Florida Blue to Serenity Blue.Thanks, dudes. Now that I live in Florida I can’t even buy ink with my statename on it.OK, this is getting too self-referential. About the articlefor a sec. The most key point is that revision does not necessarily meancutting material. Yeah, you’ll probably cut some, maybe a ton. But revision isa lot about writing new stuff, to clarify, to make more compelling, to makemore magic. I say, during revising: Let it flow, let it flow, let it flow.Before I sign off, here’s some wonderful news from DianeDettmann, an early adopter of You’ve Gota Book in You: Her new book, Courageous Footsteps: A WWII Novel, is now available at Amazon, Barnes and Noble andother online bookstores, as well as in bookstores local to her town of Afton,Minnesota.She’s launching the book locally at an historic ice cream parlorin Afton on August 8 from 2-4.

{"title": "Why we Compete", "date": "Thursday, July 30, 2015", "text": "Zestful Blog Post #117As it happens, LeftField won a Goldie award (Mystery/Thriller category) at the GCLS conferencelast weekend in New Orleans. Notice I say ‘a Goldie,’ not ‘the Goldie.’Everybody knows awards processes are inexact andnervewracking. While waiting for the ceremony to get going, I consumed twomartinis (Tanqueray, dry, up, olives), a charcuterie plate, then a plate of lettuce-sashimiwraps, then two pieces of s’mores pie, which I would never do in real life.(The pie.) (It was free.)As the show started up, I thought about the Olympics, whichI avidly watch every time. I always find myself envying, ina way, athletes whose medals depend on empirical measurement (fastest, highest,most goals), and pitying, in a way, athletes who rely on being ‘best’ accordingto judges. At least in the Olympics the judges have lists of exacting criteriato apply, which help quantify the aesthetics. Not that that eliminatescontroversy.But in literature? Articles have been written, letters sent,feuds fought over prizes. Do you remember the shitstorm back in 1987 over ToniMorrison’s Beloved? If you weren’tborn yet, that’s OK. The book was shortlisted for the National Book Award butlost to Paco’s Story by LarryHeinemann. Forty-eight black authors wrote an emotional open letter that waspublished in the New York Times book review, saying that Toni should have won aNational Book Award or Pulitzer by then. Lo and behold, a few months later, thePulitzer went to Beloved. Did thatletter have any effect? Who can say?So last Saturday night my name was announced and I jogged upto the podium and said in part that such things are always a crapshoot, becausejudging is by definition subjective. And I thanked the judges, which one shouldalways do.Having been both a winner and loser of literarycompetitions, and a judge in several of them, I know just how idiosyncratic theprocess is. You have preferences in style and theme. You might have heard somescuttlebutt about an author that makes you frown—or smile. And how can youdecide which piece of art is ‘best’ among a bunch of good ones? But you striveto be impartial, because you have a horror of someone judging your work in a cavalier way. You bearkarma in mind. It is what it is.The GCLS organizers address the inherent-unfairness issue byawarding more than one prize per category, depending on the number ofentries/finalists. This dilutes the distinction of the prize and makes thelosers feel even worse, but it does exponentially increase winner happiness byletting two or three people go home witha piece of crystal and bragging rights. The other winners inmy category were Anne Laughlin for TheAcquittal and Nene Adams for TheConsequence of Murder. Congratulations, women!I might add that this practice also increases the number oftimes the GCLS is mentioned and discussed. The organization and conference havegrown from just a handful of women to many hundreds. This year’s conferenceattendance was about 350. That’s significant.Why prizes at all? Because prizes, along with bestsellerlists and reviews, are our report cards. They influence customer choice. Andthat’s why we put ourselves through this imperfect, disquieting process.

{"title": "Everyday Scholarship", "date": "Thursday, July 16, 2015", "text": "Zestful Blog Post #115Recently while killing time in a strip mall, I went into aused bookshop, which started a chain of events that led to this post. I call theseevents everyday scholarship, and here is the story.In that shop I came across a 1941 Modern Library anthologyof American plays (full cloth binding—God, those were the days) and bought itfor a few dollars. Opened it the other day and commenced reading LillianHellman’s The Little Foxes, which I’dnever read or seen on stage. Not to be confused with The Children’s Hour.Almost immediately, I felt like I was reading the play in avacuum. What was the author intending to communicate in this piece, which isset in 1900 and had its premiere in 1939? Even knowing something about thepolitical and social landscapes of those two eras, I couldn’t immediately graspit.Briefly, The LittleFoxes centers on a well-to-do Southern family not far postbellum, whofight, argue, and scheme against one another. The object of the game is avaguely described cotton mill and the wealth and power it would bring towhoever owns the largest share.I already knew Lillian Hellman was decidedly leftist in herpolitics and thus one might expect that point of view to be advanced in theplay. But I wanted some more gloss, so I could be a more acute reader. I searchedon line and discovered just the thing: a lengthy review of the play byElizabeth Hardwick in the New York Reviewof Books. This review was written in 1967, of a Broadway revival in thatsame year. Yet another era, with its own social and political context!Hardwick was pretty scathing, stopping just short of callingthe play commie propaganda. But she also compared it against her own standardsof good drama. Her main complaints were over-simplified characters (dividedinto good and bad), and implausible motivation for the key character of Horace.He’s a retired banker, whose money could put the family over the top in theirquest to complete the sizable downpayment on the mill.Horace is against putting money into the mill, and Hardwickquestions why a banker wouldn’t recognize the terrific investment opportunityand release the money? I also read the fierce letters to the editor on the review,and Hardwick’s answering of them. Literary feuding at its best! It was almostas good as drinking a martini at the Algonquin.I finished reading the play expecting to agree with Hardwick’sopinions, and I did agree with some of them, especially her criticism ofHellman’s relentless lefty preachiness. But I felt the Horace character behavedreasonably, given the framework of the play: He recognized that the mill wouldbe run in an avaricious fashion by his crummy brothers-in-law, and whileprofitable, would not be a force for good.In this post, I’ve attempted to answer the question: Whyshould I read literary criticism? Answer: because it makes your brain better,and because it’s a deep kind of fun. When your own curiosity drives you to learn and think, well, it's fabulous. The Web makes it so easy to find viewpoints andcounter-viewpoints on practically everything. What an era we live in.What do you think?

{"title": "Wild Kingdom", "date": "Thursday, July 9, 2015", "text": "Zestful Blog Post #114I’m currently working on a new article for Writer’s Digest,this one on using just two tools to fix any problem in a fiction manuscript.Curious? So am I…But so hey, one of my correspondents had a few questions viaemail, and after answering, I thought yall might like to hear it too. (Thankyou, C./M.)The questions concerned a manuscript nearing completion, andwhat should be done about getting it into the world.Here’s what I say:Regarding Spruce Park Press, I’m not publishing anybodyexcept myself at the moment; not sure if I ever will; gotta see how that goes.It’s a wild kingdom out there in our business right now. I was thinking I’dstay self-published from now on, but am considering writing a novel expresslyfor my agent to shop around, and give the Big 5 another go. [My friend Jan Kimmel took this photo in Kenya. Wild, you know, kingdom.]  The so-called Big 5 are the largest 5 publishers in New York,at the moment Penguin Random House (yes, all one name; they merged a whileback), Macmillan, HarperCollins, Hachette, and Simon & Schuster. My RitaFarmer series was initially published by Macmillan.Most newbies want to try to break into the Big 5; if that’syou, you should start submitting to agents when your ms is as ready as it canbe. Have you had a professional edit yet? I strongly recommend one, whether youtry for representation or self-publish. There are lots of good editors outthere; I’m one of them. I’ve just freshened up my  servicepage  with some client raves.Regarding Big 5 vs. small press. You’d get the same royaltyrates from either, pretty much. Big 5 will give you more exposure in stores,but you’re a minnow in a big pond, unless you get a mega deal right away.Smaller presses can do a very good job in other ways, and some writers arehappy with their smaller press. I do, however, remember being at the Lambdaawards the night I won, sitting next to my (small-press) publisher, who, inanswer to my question about, like, any plans to expand?, leaned back in hischair, laced his fingers behind his head, and said, “I like being small.” Mynext title was in production, and I was under contract for the next, but wasoutta there after that.The option to self-pub will always be there. If you shakethe bushes and nothing falls out, you can always DIY.News on appearances:1) Golden CrownI’ll be attending the Golden Crown Literary Societyconference in New Orleans in a couple of weeks. Left Field is a finalist for a ‘Goldie’ award, therefore I willsuffer through the awards ceremony, prepared for both best and worst. It’s allworst, actually.Have never done three panels in one conference before:My own (I’ll moderate) called “Breaking Bad: Writing aboutLesbians Drinking, Smoking, Drugging, Swearing, Stealing, and Fighting” with CheyneCurry, Isabella, Riley Adair Garret, JM Redmann, and Ann Aptaker.Then I’ll join “Liar, Liar”, moderated by Carsen Taite, withDorothy Allison, Georgia Beers, Melissa Brayden, and Andi Marquette.We’re all to come prepared with a few true outrageous stories about ourselves,as well as one false one. Audience gets to guess. I hope there will be hugeprizes for the winners. This one will be open to the public. (Dorothy is doingthe keynote address this year, as well. Stay away if four-letter words combinedwith the names of deities bother you…)Also I’ll be on “We’ve Come to Murder”, moderated by BaxterClare Trautman, with MavisApplewater, Erica Lawson, and Martha Miller.Plus I’ll do an author reading & chat with JessieChandler, Justine Saracen, Wynn Malone, Lacey Schmidt, and Kenna White.So that’s actually like four times I have to show upsomewhere…2) Florida HeritageFor the second year in a row I’ve gotten roped intopresenting at the Florida Heritage BookFestival and Writers Conference in September. I’ll lead a special critiquesession on Thursday, then will deliver a presentation on Friday, “FearlessWriting.” The web site has info on signing up for everything, including critiqueday. It’s a very nicely run conference in beautiful St. Augustine. If you joinmy critique group you’ll get an individual written consult from me on yourfirst 10 pages, and the opportunity to learn and ask questions all day long.And no, I can't make it to the Florida Writers Association conference this year, but hope to be there next year.What do you think?

{"title": "The Gift of Stupidity", "date": "Thursday, July 2, 2015", "text": "Zestful Blog Post #113As an author, I’ve long been a student of the humancondition. Actually, I commenced being a student of the humancondition in my earliest sandbox days, then turned to writing as a form ofself-defense.Mainly, I’m fascinated with one question: What makes peopledo what they do? A major sub-category of this question is: What makes criminalsdo the crazy shit they do? Or, perhaps more accurately, what makes a person docrazy shit for which they get caught and slapped with humiliating criminalcharges?I remember reading OurLady of the Forest by David Guterson, in which there’s a mention of someguy who broke into a dentist’s office for the nitrous oxide, which he inhaledfor the high while masturbating. He quickly died after getting too hypoxic. Theincident was just a mention and not part of the plot; I think Guterson putit in mainly to help establish atmosphere. But it stuck in my mind. That novelwas set in and around Forks, Washington, a remote, poverty-mauled outpost inthe Olympic rainforest later made much more famous by Stephenie (yes, that’sthe right spelling) Meyer in her Twilightseries.[A river runs through Forks, more or less. Photo by M. Burrows.]At the time, I was living on the Olympic Peninsula inWashington, not far from Forks. And I happened to know the mayor of Forks (wewere both Area Musicians), who also happened to be a counselor to a whole lotof messed-up Forkians who had run afoul of the law in one dumbass way oranother. I asked him if he’d ever heard of a nitrous-oxide incident like theone in Guterson’s story, and he said he didn’t know if it had really happened,but he could easily believe it, given what he handled on a daily basis.I asked him WHY people get into such messes, and heanswered, “Bad decisions.”Well, yeah.My friend is a compassionate man. But I mean, we’re talkingstupidity, right? Can we call a dolt a dolt here? I know substance abuse canrob people of their common sense. But it seems there are lots of stone-soberidiots out there as well. But, too, not every dumbass does stuff they can getarrested for, drunk or not. Mostly they just wind up in emergency rooms.The mystery of stupidity is something I wonder and wonderabout. What would authors do without characters who make bad decisions?What do you think?

{"title": "Don't Wanna", "date": "Thursday, June 25, 2015", "text": "Zestful Blog Post #112When you don’t feel like writing, what should you do?Your first option is to not write. Of course. Millions ofpeople, from all walks of life, enjoy the act of not writing on a daily basis. Butif you’ve already made the decision to be a writer, you believe you reallyought to write, you’ve enjoyed writing in the past, you know you have somethingto say or at least something you need to explore—you have to figure out a wayto produce.I’ve known writers who get in trouble when they equatewriting to some other activity that requires proper enthusiasm. Like nobody isgoing to climb a mountain if they don’t feel like it, right? You’ve got to haveenthusiasm and passion for any climb, besides physical conditioning.For years, whenever I recognized that I was in a slump, Itried to make myself want to write.Tried to change my attitude somehow, tried to gin up enthusiasm. Tried tostruggle against apathy. Struggle upon struggle. Gosh, what fun.It is true that writing is a craft, and thus a writerbenefits from adopting the mindset of a craftsman (this word applies to bothsexes, because it’s more rhythmic than ‘craftsperson’ and because I say so). Acraftsman takes materials and tools and makes something. Fine. You can build achair even if you’re having an off day. It will still be a chair, serviceableand perhaps even beautiful. But there is more.Gradually, when I became a professional—that is, when Istarted to earn a significant portion of my income from writing—it all cameclear. All you have to do is show up and start working. No matter if yourimmediate results suck. Just show up on the page and see what happens. If youdo that faithfully, you learn that the magic will come IF you work. The workitself produces the magic.[I taped this postcard to my current notebook.Here's a guy who struggled, but he produced, boy howdy did theson of a bitch produce. And he found the magic.]I have to re-learn this every time. I think, man, I don’tknow how to get going on this story / article / blog post. What’ll I do? Then Ijust get started, in some random place, perhaps, with just the grain of an ideato explore. I know that if I work on an idea or angle and find that’s NOT theright path, that’s OK, I’ll have eliminated one possibility. But invariably, ifthat first angle conks out, it always shoots out a little spark of some newidea or possibility. And then I’m on my way. It might not be smooth from thenon, but I’ll be producing material, and I know it will all come together,sooner or later.Anyone who cares deeply about the quality of what theyproduce—chair-maker or author—and who sticks with it, learns this. It's incredibly freeing. Creativegurus have spread the word for ages, but the word still needs spreading. The magic’s already there. Show up, get to work, and go findit. Better yet, let it come to you.What do you think?

{"title": "The Power of Structure", "date": "Thursday, June 18, 2015", "text": "Zestful Blog Post #111The Power of StructureLast night I watched a movie from 1952 called “The CrimsonPirate”, starring Burt Lancaster and some other people who don’t count because BurtLancaster is the best ever. I love him, especially in roles where he gets to doacrobat stuff, which he does in “The Crimson Pirate”. (In case you’re not aBurt Lancaster aficionado, he was a circus acrobat early in his career. Which helpsexplain why he’s so graceful onscreen, whether he’s drinking a cup of coffee whileglancing at someone or swinging from the crow’s nest to the yardarm or whateverthe hell those things are called.)[Avast, ye scurvy dogs! Photo by ES.]The film is basically a pirate spoof, complete with madcapsoundtrack, and it’s actually a lot of fun. “Pirates of the Caribbean” rippedoff a bunch of elements of it, particularly the guys-walking-on-the-sea-floor scenes.You could watch this movie and brush it off as lightweightentertainment. And it is. But here’s the thing. Lots of people think there’snot much to it. Like, hey, let’s make a goofball movie and make a milliondollars! (Or: Let’s write a cheesy book and make a million dollars! Right.) Butit’s good lightweight entertainment.What makes it good? Attention to the structure of the story. I stand by thisand will support it. Read on.Writers make a mistake when they write crummy, carelessmaterial and think it will work because there’s humor in it, or they have aunique premise. Roland Kibbee and Waldo Salt, writers of “The Crimson Pirate”,took care to craft a satisfying story structure, a.k.a. plot. They could havegotten away with a simpler structure, but because they included elements ofepic stories, they elevated the movie to zany excellence. Key example: Burt’s first mate isn’t that much of a teamplayer, and he thinks Burt isn’t ruthless enough to be a great pirate leader.He sneaks around, spying, hears some partial information, and based on thatleads the pirates to mutiny. This forces Burt to be even braver and more inventive,in order to overcome the mutiny. He does, and at this point you basicallyforget the first mate. He’s served his purpose as a stumbling-block for thehero. Much excitement is going on. The pirates are in a struggle to help liberatean island from the unjust rule of the British, whose navy ship is trying todestroy the pirates.But! The first mate shows up again just before the finalbattle of the pirates against the miserable limeys. You think he’s going toruin things again for Burt, but he reveals that he’s ashamed of havingdouble-crossed Burt, and sacrifices himself to help the pirates win. He’slearned that some things are more important than treasure, like the dignity ofa downtrodden people. First mate stays at the helm of the pirate ship as Burtand all the others slip overboard to swim secretly to the King’s ship and takeit over. The King’s guys think the pirate ship is bent on shelling them, sothey blow it out of the water first. While they’re busy doing this, the pirateshave boarded them and quickly overpower them. Burt kisses the pretty daughterof the rebel leader. Yay, the end.So: If you’re still with me, and I hope you are, it’s the arcof the first mate’s character—and you can almost miss it!—that elevates thismovie from mundane to affecting. When you have a character who does a 180: frombad to good, or from good to bad, you’ve got something compelling. The sequencehere: Selfish bad guy, change of heart, repentance, self-sacrifice to help thecause.You are thinking perhaps of Sydney Carton in Dickens’s A Tale of Two Cities. Yes. You can thinkof more, no doubt, in great stories all over the place.Structure. You can think it through, focus, and write it.p.s. I passed the lifeguard final exam.What do you think?

{"title": "Underthink It", "date": "Thursday, June 11, 2015", "text": "Zestful Blog Post #110If you joined us last week and read my post about undertakingYMCA lifeguard training, you might be pleased to know that I passed thewater-skills test and was accepted into the program. My classmates and Ireceived our official rescue packs (photo below), yay.A particular thing happened during training that I want toshare, because it bears on a creative life. Forgive the training details, butthere is a point.[In here you keep your breathing mask and gloves. Photo by ES.]Everyone in my class is 16-18 years old except me. (My birthdate is a matter of public record but I wish it weren’t.) Our instructor is aveteran lifeguard and aquatics manager. One evening we were in the pool practicing water rescues,using a piece of equipment called the rescue tube. This is a thin, flexiblefloat with a strap that you keep slung over your shoulder all the time you’reon duty. In an emergency, you can swim out and use it to help you rescuesomeone. We learned how to approach a facedown victim and flip them faceup whileat the same time rolling the person onto the tube so you can start rescuebreathing and tow them in.This is not easy. I tried and tried to get my ‘victim’ ontothe tube but she’d (we’re all females in this class, thankfully for the teenagehormone factor) slip off, or I’d be unable to sink the thing enough to wedge itunder her past her neck. Our instructor kept coaching me, but I couldn’t do it.I kept trying to remember each micro-step of the process, which we learned inthe classroom, and applying them one by one. Everybody else got it after one ortwo tries. I worried that the instructor thought I was a clumsy idiot. FinallyI figured out the missing piece (you have to pull them onto the tube, not push the tube under them) and now I’m confident with it.A couple of nights later we started in on backboardextractions. The bitchin part of this one is sinking the board exactly right soit comes up correctly beneath the victim. It takes a surprising amount ofstrength and agility to do this, because the board is very buoyant, and not stablein the water unless the victim is centered on it just so. I was slightlygratified to see my young concrete-thighed, swim-team companions struggle toget it right. When it came to my turn, the instructor shouted, “Don’t overthinkit, Elizabeth!”That was all it took. I kicked up, put my weight on theboard, and zoomed it under the victim and it came to rest perfectly.I was like, yeah.Get the gestalt of the thing, view it as a whole, do it in one move. Based onmy struggles with the tube technique, the instructor knew exactly what to tellme.After class I pondered the creative process. It’s easy forwriters and other creative humans to overthink things, which leads to doubt. Isthis the right way to do this? What if it isn’t? Gosh, I don’t know!So, good advice for us all: Relax, know you can do it, don’t overthink it. Or, since weprefer positive admonitions to negative ones: Underthink it and see what happens.What do you think? To post, click below where it says, 'NoComments,' or '2 Comments,' or whatever.

{"title": "A Blogger Takes Action", "date": "Thursday, June 4, 2015", "text": "Zestful Blog Post #109[Pre-blog note: My webmistress figured out why so manypeople couldn’t leave comments on this blog, and we have changed the commentfunction accordingly. If you blog on Blogspot too, you might find the followingexplanation interesting. If not, spare your brain temperature and skip thisgraph. If you have third-party cookies disabled, it wasn’t letting you finishyour comment. It was a shortcut that Google was using to store the comment, butit basically was a flaw, because it had this negative ramification. The newcomment function no longer requires third-party cookies. So hey, if you’ve beenstymied before, I invite you to give it a try. If you still have problems,please please tell me via email.]One of our gang, a follower of this blog named Patricia Hilliard,left this comment on my recent post #107, which was about bloggers havingoriginal ideas (or not):“I sit down to write a blog and realize many of us have thesame ideas. There's a need for action and accomplishment. Something we writersfind difficult since it involves getting out of our chairs. But if we do, andcome back to our chairs, we'll have something really worth reading. WE NEEDBLOGS TO BE WORTHY OF THE TIME TO READ THEM.”I commented back, “Amen!” In that spirit, and in the spirit of zestful living, I’llshare something new: I’ve been training to pass the physical test for YMCAlifeguard certification.When I was a little kid my mom sent me to swimming lessonsat the local high school, where guys on the swim team basically shoved us intothe deep end and pulled us out if we sank. Never was a good swimmer, though Icould tread water in an emergency long enough to get hypothermia and dieanyway.After my shoulder surgery about a year ago, I did rehab exercisesin the pool, and found it fabulous. Then, as I paddled around, I thought,wouldn’t it be great to learn to swim really well? I’d always felt sort ofashamed when in the water with people who actually knew how to swim.So I surfed around on line and found Terry Laughlin’s Total Immersion DVDs, and joined the Yand started teaching myself a decent freestyle stroke. Recently I got thebreaststroke and butterfly DVDs as well, and started work on the breaststroke.A few weeks ago one of the lifeguards and I were shooting the breeze and shesaid she thought I should go through lifeguard training, because they alwaysneed guards.At first I was like haha, but then I thought, “Well, what ifI could?” I would not just be a post-menopausal woman; I would be a BADASSpost-menopausal woman.“You could do it!” said Brenda, herself a badasspost-menopausal woman.On the first night of class, you have to demonstrate avariety of swimming and diving skills. If you fail, you get your course feeback and you slink away in shame. If you pass, you go through the 9-day courseon lifesaving, advanced first aid and emergency care, CPR, and AED (thedefibrillator thing). If you pass the exams, you’re eligible for employment asa lifeguard at the Y. I learned you can work as little as one 4-hour shift aweek, get paid (OK, minimum wage), plus get a free membership, which in my casewould combine to make a positive cash flow of more than $2,000 per year. Plus,besides the honor of possibly saving lives, I’d like to get a look into thatsubculture of guarding. I’m already learning the main line of dialogue, whichis, “Was that thunder? Did you hear thunder?”So I’ve been going to the pool with the list of requirementsand an empty Altoids tin, and practicing. I swim to the middle (the deepestpart of this pool), sink the tin, then go back to the end of my lane. Swim out,find the tin, dive down to get it, return to surface, tread water for 1 minwithout arms, then return to side not using arms, carrying tin. They make youdive for a ring instead of an Altoids tin. Altoids tins rust on the inside, I’ve found.Swim 100 yards of freestyle, then 50 each of breast,sidestroke, breast head up, freestyle head up, and backstroke no arms usingfrog kick. Short underwater swim as well. The head-up strokes are a beeatch,because your lower body wants to sink in compensation for your head being outof the water. But they are the ‘safe-approach’ strokes when swimming to someonein distress.So OK, I’m taking a risk telling you this, because I haven’tpassed that physical skills test yet. It’s coming up TOMORROW NIGHT. Wish meluck.p.s. Writer’s Digest is running a hugesale for a few days. You can get my book and everything else for 40% off,even stuff that’s already on special.

{"title": "Meaningful Connection", "date": "Thursday, May 28, 2015", "text": "Zestful Blog Post #108Here’s an example of how social media led not merely to anexpansion of my circle, but to a meaningful exchange.The excellent and well known FoxTale Book Shoppein Atlanta regularly tweets the names of authors whose books are selling wellthat week. A couple of months ago they tweeted my name among a handful of otherauthors, and I tweeted back thanking them, and favorited the tweet and all thatbullshit. I asked if they were talking about You’ve Got a Book in You, and they said yes. They tweeted my name afew weeks in a row, and I said thanks every time.[I have come to accept that social media is a bucket of tools that can buildrelationships.Photo by ES.]Then the social media guru for the store, Gary, asked for myemail saying that the store was hosting a multi-week writing workshop with mybook as its text, and maybe I’d like to Skype in sometime? I said sure.So he linked up me with Beth Hermes, anaccomplished author herself and the workshop leader. We set up a video Skypeconnection (yes, I brushed my hair first), and it went off very nicely. I was able to give some energy and ‘extrastuff’ to the aspiring authors, and they were able to ask any questions theywanted. And they had some good ones! Questions I hadn’t gotten before, like, “Pleasediscuss the physical aspect of ‘heartbrain’,” and “How did you develop yourbook as a whole?” Answers to these and other Qs led to specific tidbits andaspects of bigger things that it seems only spontaneous discussion can yield.It was a fun hour. When it came time to say goodbye, I askedif they felt this had been worthwhile, and got an enthusiastic chorus of yeses.But did I mention that I blog and give them the url? Did I ask them to friendme on Facebook? Did I hustle up my custom coaching services? That is the kindof stuff any speaker should do, and I forgot, because I was focused on them andwhat they wanted. It was a mistake not to try to sell myself a little bit more,but I will learn. I swear I will learn and do better.The reason I wrote this post, though, was to show how oneconnection can lead to another, and result not simply in more connections, but somethingbeautiful, fun, and substantial.If you have something to offer, you can help people.What do you think?

{"title": "Stoic Message", "date": "Thursday, May 21, 2015", "text": "Zestful Blog Post #107Ever since taking some courses in philosophy at Michigan State, I've been interested in Stoicism, that ancient Hellenistic school of thought. Zeno, Seneca, and Epictetus were the main guys we still read today. To hyper-simplify, the Stoics said: Let nothing bother you; suck up any discomfort you can't immediately eliminate; if you do so you'll be free.I was re-reading Seneca not long ago, and was struck by this passage, which I underlined:\"It is disgraceful that a man who is old or in sight of old age should have a wisdom deriving solely from his notebook. 'Zeno said this.' And what have you said? 'Cleanthes said that.' What have you said? How much longer[Photo by ES]are you going to serve under others' orders? Assume authority yourself and utter something that may be handed down to posterity. Produce something from your own resources.\"I think of this quote when I see somebody's blog that only comprises links and quotes from other bloggers or sources. I'm like, if I follow your blog, I expect YOU to write it. But what about 'guest posts'? What about 'blog tours'? I guess those things must be OK. Are they? It all seems like such a hustle. Am I hopelessly out of it?Moreover, my point is this: There's so much thought out there, so much, yes, wisdom apart from the dreck, that it's easy to give over the wisdom-making to others. Hell, it's easy to give over the MAKING to others. Let's not. What do YOU think? What do YOU say? What do YOU make?I love you."},
{"title": "Writing for Writers", "date": "Thursday, May 14, 2015", "text": "Zestful Blog Post #106One of my favorite things to do is write articles for Writer’s Digest magazine. At a Q & Arecently, someone asked whether the magazine assigns me topics, or I have tocome up with them myself. And what’s a ‘contributing editor’, anyway?The answer to the second Q will answer the first as well. Ingeneral, a contributing editor is a freelance writer who has contributedfrequently to the publication, who is thought to have something of a fan base,and who has demonstrated reliability, both in generating new ideas and executingthem. The term ‘editor’ in this case is usually an honorific, and I've begunseeing the term ‘contributing writer’ on magazine mastheads instead of ‘contributingeditor’.[Now that's what I call a masthead. Photo by ES]In the case of Writer’sDigest, in exchange for the credential, I agreed not to write for othermagazines that might be considered directly competing with WD, such as The Writer and Poets & Writers. Besides getting your name on the masthead, asa contributing editor your ideas get special consideration by the editorialstaff. The top editor at WD, Jessica Strawser, and I have become friends overthe years, which is a very nice side benefit.But yeah, I’m expected to come up with ideas for articles I’dlike to write, and pitch them in some cogent form. I send Jessica twoor more at a time, a practice that worked to get me my first assignment at thatmagazine 10 years and several editors ago, and to which I clingsuperstitiously. If the editor likes a particular idea, there might be someback-and-forth as the editor gives input. You work together to refine or shiftthe focus or whatever, and then you agree on length and payment.Once I was asked to write an FOB (front-of-book, meaning the magazine) column on a particularsubject on short notice when some other writer had to bow out for some reason.That was fun, and I felt honored to be trusted to execute the piece fast andwell. But that was an exception.Needless to say, when you agree to a deadline, you must meetit. Given the long lead time of most monthlies, you usually get weeks,sometimes even months, to deliver. Having started my career at a smallnewspaper, deadlines have never bothered me. I've never missed one, whether forthe magazine, or contributing a story to an anthology (which by the way seebelow), or turning in a book-length manuscript. [Sound of vigorous knocking onwood.] And I’m always shocked when I hear of some writer missing a deadline. I’mlike, what? You have this greatopportunity, multiple other people are counting on you, and you fail to get thejob done? Being busy is not an excuse. I guess somebody dying might be an excuse,especially if it’s you.I want to write more about coming up with ideas formagazines, but will save that for a future post. Meanwhile, I’d like to plug anew anthology I'm honored to have a story in (along with a buncha cool women):These tales ofmurder, mayhem, and suspense by some of today’s finest crime writers will keepyou up way past your bedtime!The lesbians on theloose in this collection are an entertaining mix of protagonists: cops, amateursleuths, a PI, a judge, a bounty hunter, and one very insightful dog. There’seven an intrepid high schooler and a mystery writer.

{"title": "Forgiving the Unforgivable", "date": "Thursday, May 7, 2015", "text": "Zestful Blog Post #105Forgiveness has long been an absorbing interest of mine. Iwonder if that’s so for most people who grew up under the Judeo-Christian ideology. My family was as Roman Catholic as my mom could engineer. All of us kids were sent tocatechism lessons, the weeknight equivalent of Protestant kids’ Sunday school.As far as I was concerned, the only reason to go to catechism was SisterJeffrey Ann, whose job was to prepare us public-school seven-year-olds for ourFirst Communion. She was kind and beautiful, standing approximately eight feettall in her full habit and wimple.One snowy Michigan night, she deconstructed the Our Fatherfor us. We—all the little Poles, Italians, and Irish in town—lots of Irish, asMr. and Mrs. Flynn obeyed the proscription against birth control scrupulously—had beenreciting the prayer for years, but had we stopped to ponder what it reallymeant? We hadn't.Sister Jeffrey Ann went over the prayer line by line, wordby word. When she came to “as we forgive those who trespass against us,” it hitme like an ice bucket challenge. According to the sister, holy crap, we, us'ns,who were years from even learning what Kotex were, we, personally, were supposed toforgive.Up until then, I had the impression that just by saying theprayer you were making a deposit on the good side of your ledger; it hadnothing to do with real life. Whenever some other kid did me wrong, all I caredabout was revenge.Sister Jeffrey Ann’s lesson can beultimately simplified to THIS MEANS YOU. Immediate. Timeless.Little slights, of course, are easy to forgive. Aren’t they?What fascinates me are people who forgive the unforgivable.[It was my honor to meet and hang with Agnes Furey earlierthis year. Photo by Unknown Barista.]In Zestful Blog post #67 (Aug. 21, 2014), I wrote about how to develop one's voice as a writer. I mentioned a book called Wildflowers in the Median: A Restorative Journey into Healing,Justice, and Joy by Agnes Furey and Leonard Scovens. Leonard is a confessedand convicted double murderer, and Agnes is the mother and grandmother of histwo victims. The book came about because Agnes decided if she didn't forgiveLeonard, her life wouldn't be worth living. She did so, he responded, and theybegan to build a friendship. The book was a result of that relationship. (And my meeting Agnes was a result of that blog post.)Separately yet together, Agnes and Leonard are working on an initiativecalled restorative justice, whereby victims and perpetrators get connected andhave a dialogue. If the dialogue goes right, three things happen: the perpacknowledges and takes responsibility for his or her crime; the victim (orsurvivor) forgives; both find a measure of peace. Agnes is a member of RestorativeJustice International, where you can learn more.This is a huge subject, and I’m thinking I ought to writemuch more about it, beyond this blog. The times seem to demand it. AlthoughAgnes, who lives in Tallahassee, Florida, is well into what people call ‘the retirement years’, she’s constantlybusy. Today she told me she’s on her way to a conference on restorative justicein Louisiana. “Are you going to be a presenter?” I asked.“No,” she said. “I’m going to learn.”Our human world seems full of chaos.

{"title": "Shelf Space For Joe Blow", "date": "Thursday, April 30, 2015", "text": "Zestful Blog Post #104When I started working at the second store Tom and LouisBorders opened, in suburban Detroit, we had a lot of autonomy. One of the side thingswe did was ‘consignments’. We wanted to be as inclusive as possible. Therefore,anybody who believed in their book enough to go the trouble and expense ofhaving it produced—after, in most cases, having tried and failed to find apublisher—could get their book on our shelves. The process was labor intensive:each copy of each book had to be specially marked so it could be rung up properly(in the unlikely event that somebody bought it), then shelved, then kept trackof. Each author had to be paid by check, and each author was entitled to callup and ask at any time how things were going. We could only carry two or threecopies at a time.This amounted to an unprofitable situation for the store,but we kept it up essentially as a public service. Naturally, when the companygot big and everybody had to do what headquarters said, consignments went away.Customers rarely bought consignment titles, in no small partbecause production values were dismal. Joe Blow, who had written a 327-pagemanifesto on why the Upper Peninsula should be granted sovereign nation status,had to balance the cost of hardcover vs. paper cover; spiral binding vs. stapledvs. perfect vs. sewn; glossy cover stock vs. matte; a professional designer vs.his admittedly talented eleven-year-old niece; a print run of 200 at a cost of$15 per copy at a total cost of $3,000 payable now, vs. a run of 1,000 at $8per copy for a total of $8,000. No wonder most self-pubbed titles lookedpathetic, whether they contained precious gems of knowledge or drivel.Fast-forward to today. For zero cash upfront, or for verylittle, Joe Blow’s descendants can insta-pub their books with production valuesthat would make Grandpa’s head explode. And they can, of course, sell theirbooks—physical and digital—on line. Still, authors crave the experience ofseeing their books on a store’s shelves.The other day my friend and blog follower Cordia sent me alink to an article by Judith Rosen in Booklifeabout a new kind of bookstore. http://booklife.com/publish/retail-libraries/04/20/2015/first-bookstore-dedicated-to-self-published-authors-opens-in-florida.htmlThe place is essentially all-consignment, where authors payfor shelf placement, and are responsible for their own marketing andrestocking. It’s a truly new business model for bookstores, and I’ll beinterested to see if it catches on. I think it will. Be on the lookout for manymore titles by the Blow publishing dynasty.My own most recent title, Left Field, was just reviewed by the talented and perceptive teamof Cheri Fuller and Nikki Little in Curvemagazine online. Excerpt: “The mystery is well done and complex but not overlyso, and the author did an admirable job making us second-guess our assumptionsthroughout the book. This one is filled with deception, shady dealings,conspiracies, and questionable characters. What more could a reader ask for?” http://www.curvemag.com/Reviews/Under-the-Radar-454/ I'll tell you that an author couldn't ask for a nicer review.What do you think of this post?

{"title": "Stuff That Bugs Me, Vol. I", "date": "Thursday, April 23, 2015", "text": "Zestful Blog Post #103As I sat down to my coffee and breakfast this morning, penand paper in hand to rough out this blog post—I knew not what it would be—I wasinternally grumbling about misuses of language I’d noticed recently. Then myhand just started writing. At the top of the page appeared, “Stuff That Bugs Me”.I thought, it’s true I was brought up not to complain and findfault, but dammit, I’m gonna. My hand then wrote, ‘Volume I’. I burst outlaughing. Here we go.I regularly read a popular magazine, which is usually goodwith copy editing. But the most recent issue contained two blunders, the firstbeing ‘nonplussed’ to mean ‘calm and collected’. This is sloppy and brainless. I will explain.The word comes from the Latin ‘non plus’, meaning ‘no more’,as in ‘I’m so freaked out, I can’t handle any more! I can’t go forward!’Like ‘literally’ to some people, ‘nonplussed’ has come tomean the opposite of its original definition.And here we come to the prescriptive-vs.-descriptiveargument involving dictionaries and other arbiters of linguistic accuracy. Ifenough people start using ‘nonplussed’ as a fancy way of saying ‘calm’, thatdefinition will be first in every dictionary ere long and every moron will beusing it that way.Webster’s Third, which came out in 1960, must be blamed forstarting the ‘descriptive’ trend in dictionaries. Some think civilization beganto decay in the 60s because of LSD and long hair on men, but it was really Webster’s Third.[This is not Webster’s Third, whichwill never darken my dictionary stand. This is my Compact OED (Oxford English Dictionary),magnifier visible on bookcase to the left. Photo by ES.]I know language evolves. I get that. For instance, ‘get’ didnot commonly mean ‘understand’, but it does now. I’m fine with that—there’s someintelligence to that particular evolution, having to do with economy andrhythm.But using ‘nonplussed’ to mean its opposite is simply dumb.It’s the ‘non’ prefix that makes intellectually lazy people think it must mean ‘unruffled’or ‘not bothered’. I stand against such corruptions, even though I use onesthat have evolved over a long time, like ‘egregious’, which originally meant ‘illustrious’;‘of a high order’. That changed during the Renaissance, so I don’t remember it.Therefore, we come to the solution for the descriptive-vs.-prescriptiveargument: If the meaning of a word starts to change to its opposite,or become dumbed down in any way DURING MY LIFETIME, I’m against it, and youshould be too.The other error in the same magazine was, “…you’ll need lotsof money and some serious cajones.” Really? You’ll need money and some Peruvianpercussion instruments? Oh, wait, you must mean ‘cojones’, which are testiclesor, informally, courage. Well, why’n’t you say so?Those two mistakes should properly be laid at the feet ofthe magazine’s copy editor. I’ve worked as a copy editor; it was part of myjack-of-all-trades job on a minor metropolitan newspaper, and of course I editmy own material. Also, I throw in some copy editing when doing manuscript analysisand development with private clients. I’m considering including a full copyedit with my services. For one reason, it will save my clients having to hiresomebody else to do it, and for another, I will catch inadvertent blunders less experienced editors might miss. BTW,if you’re interested in working with me on your manuscript or career, justshoot me an email; the contact info is on my web site. I’ll send you my servicesheet, which includes prices.I turned to the magazine’s masthead, noted the chief copyeditor’s name, and said aloud, “What are you, a seventh-grader? This is a CondéNast publication. They can’t afford better than you?” This is how deeply thesethings affect me. I got on line, intending to send an email to the magazine,offering my services, but found no to-the-editor email address, or indeed anyemail address. This magazine doesn't publish letters to the editor, and they don’twant to hear from you or me, it seems. This is egregious, don’t you agree?What do you think?

{"title": "Zestful Parking Lot", "date": "Thursday, April 16, 2015", "text": "Zestful Blog Post #102So much of this blog has been about the craft of writing,and, in recent months, the publishing business. Zestful writing is great. But inorder to write with zest, we also have to live with zest, don’t we?And what does that mean? It can mean doing exciting or extraordinarythings like skydiving, alligator-wrestling, or going off to be a mercenary insome craphole war. You can think of a thousand more.But most of us live fairly quiet lives that sometimes vergeon the mundane, or at least the routine. Routine isn’t necessarily a negative.I like routine. But I like to feel alive, most of all. Way too often I forgetabout that part.The other day I drove to the store to pick up some things; atypical mundane errand. My mind was wandering all over the place—a snatch ofmusic, a task ahead, some unresolved grievance, some unresolved longing. Butwhen I got out of the car I saw[photo by ES]these gorgeous magnolia blossoms, and they just arrested myheartbrain. I stopped and inhaled and yeah, magnolia! The whole time I was inthe store I thought about that little tree, one of a dozen planted on thelittle islands in the parking lot. And I thought, be present, bitch. The Buddhacould be waiting for you out in that parking lot. He could be that ladychopping vegetables behind the deli counter. He could be that apple in yourhand. He IS waiting in the parking lot. He IS that lady, that apple. I often think of Buddha, but I’m also a fan of Jesus, Athena,and all the rest.There’s a reason that ‘stopping to smell the flowers’ is a timeworncliché. Literally stopping what you’re doing (which is usually going somewhere)and smelling whatever flower happens to be on hand, is a way of becomingpresent. Spiritual leaders constantly admonish us to be present. Why? Becausein the present lies eternity. In the present, true zest becomes available tous. When we’re present, we’re totally alive.So that day I was like, hell, let’s pay attention on thewalk to the car. It wasn't a pretty walk, until I got to the magnolia treeagain. But it was a beautiful walk. It was a zestful walk. Being present, no matter what we’re doing,makes life rich. It makes life life,not some meandering dream.What helps you become present?

{"title": "Is it a Race?", "date": "Thursday, April 9, 2015", "text": "Zestful Blog Post #101Usually I put up just one post here per week, on Thursdays. Last Saturday, though, I wrote a post about a promotion I wasrunning for my novel Damn Straight,and promised to give you a report. I’ll do that, then I have something else totalk about.I consider the promotion—five days free on the Amazon KindleSelect program—a  success. Data:This was the second or possibly third time I put the bookfor free on Kindle. I know the first time, the book got between two and threethousand downloads, with minimal word-spreading. Subsequent free offerings ofthe same title never do as well, but I wondered what would happen now that afew years had passed. (The reason for the promo was the big LPGA golf tournament,formerly known as ‘The Dinah’. DamnStraight is set at that tournament, and I like to watch it on TV everyyear.)The promo started at 12 a.m. Saturday, Apr. 4, 2015. I putup notices on Facebook, Twitter, a couple of Yahoo groups, and this blog.Amazon Bestsellers Ranking: By 10:50 that evening, the bookwas at #665 Free in Kindle store, and #1 in LGBT Mystery & Detective, and#1 in Lesbian Fiction. It stayed at #1 in those two categories for four days,reaching #344 overall on Monday, Apr. 6. It might have climbed higher, but onecan only spot-check these things. On Wednesday, Apr. 8, the last day of the promotion, thebook was at #936 overall, and #1 in LGBT Mystery & Detective, and #3 inLesbian Fiction. (9:34 a.m.)During the first two days, the downloads were the most at438 and 565, then dropping off every day thereafter. Total downloads: 1,446.As I write this on the morning of, Thursday, Apr. 9, DamnStraight’s rank in the Paid Kindle store is 99,737, and #59 in LGBT Mystery& Detective.What you look for after such a promo is a sales bump forthat title and others. And in fact, the other four books in the series allclimbed into the top 100 in LGBT Mystery & Detective at some point or otherduring the promotion. Holy Hell is#42, Easy Street is #60, at themoment.So basically it’s worth it to keep the free promo going forthe full 5-day period, because even though the book’s overall rank and numberof downloads slipped dramatically after the first two and a half days, it wentto and stayed at #1 almost the whole time in its narrowest category.OK, now on to other stuff. Over the past few months, I'vewritten about my publishing history. I’ll continue to share what I do, whetherit’s a promotion and its results, a new published work, whatever. But I’ll alsotalk about discoveries I make in writing techniques, reading, and living.Like-a what follows.[Photo by ES]I once saw a photograph of two young girls poised on thestarting line of a footrace. One girl's eyes were fixed anxiously on the manwith the starter's pistol. The other girl's eyes were brightly locked on thefinish line in the distance. Which girl do you think won the race?One could say that micro story is about competition. But Isee it as being, at its core, about performance. In You've Got a Book in You, I sought to help writers cast aside doubtand fear and just pour it out, trusting your own natural talent and creativity.If you’re anxious about the parameters—the starting gun, the query letter—that stuff’sgonna get in your way. But if you focus simply on the joy of doing—running fast,writing well—you’ll achieve. And you’ll be satisfied with your performance,whether you win a particular race or not.In a way, the first girl was already running, while yetpoised for the gun. The other girl wasn’t going to be really running even afterthe gun sounded.It’s paradoxical, it’s Zen, and it’s true.What do you think?

{"title": "Promo Experiment: Damn Straight Free", "date": "Saturday, April 4, 2015", "text": "Zestful Blog Post #100Apropos to my missives on marketing lately, here’s a specialI’m running, followed by some early feedback:The special (text I posted on FB this morning):Grab a freebie on Kindle: In honor of this weekend's majorLPGA tournament, the ANA Inspiration--formerly known as the Kraft Nabisco,formerly known as the Dinah, after Dinah Shore, 'the Tennessee Thrush', whofounded it, the Lambda-winning DAMN STRAIGHT is free on Amazon Kindle. Theweekend is still known as 'The Dinah' among SoCal golf cognoscenti. Lotsaparties in the Palm Springs area. (The course is Mission Hills in RanchoMirage.)DAMN STRAIGHT is set at the Dinah, where our heroine LillianByrd falls for a professional golfer with some dark danger going on in herlife. What can Lillian do but try to help? This read 'will keep you up tildawn,' according to Whitney Scott on Booklist.The feedback:This is, I believe, the second time I’ve put this book upfor free; the first was about 3 years ago, I think. I was happy with theresults then, though off the top of my head I can’t remember how many total downloads.It was in the several thousands.As soon as the special went live at midnight this morning(Saturday Apr. 4), night-owl readers (and possibly some non-nightowl overseasones) started snapping it up, slowly, then with more gusto. 30 copies weredownloaded in the first six hours; the total is approaching 90 now. Promo doneso far today: One post on Facebook, one on Twitter, and now this blog.

{"title": "Learning from the Vagaries", "date": "Thursday, April 2, 2015", "text": "Zestful Blog Post #99I've looked back through my blog and am surprised to find Ihaven’t shared the story of the genesis of LeftField. I kind of can’t believe it because I've told it a number of times toaudiences, as a parable about the vagaries of connecting with readers.At the 2010 Left Coast Crime convention I found myself on apanel called “Writing Gay Characters”, along with Laurie King, ChristopherRice, L.J. Sellers, and moderator Pat Brown. We’d been scheduled for 8:30Saturday morning, the godawfullest time slot of any convention, due to the factthat everybody’s either hung over or sleeping in from Friday night carousing.So we all straggle in with our Starbucks, and lo and beholdabout 30 people came to hear us. While all of us had written GLBT characters,it seemed that Chris and I were the only authentically queer authors on thepanel, so we more or less hijacked the discussion. Come question time, someoneasked, “What do gay and lesbian readers want? What are they looking for in thenovels they read?” [L to R: Brown, King, Rice, Sims, Sellers.Photo by Marcia.]Chris gave an intelligent answer based on his experience,then I decided to speak aloud something I’d been turning over in my mind.I talked about having used a women’s bar for the setting andfocus of my first novel, Holy Hell, andthen setting Damn Straight at ‘theDinah’ (as it was popularly known), an LPGA golf tournament and magnet forthousands of lesbian fans and revelers. (When I attended the tournament to doresearch for the book, accompanied by Marcia, we passed some time in abreakfast restaurant with another diner, who related tales of the parties she’dattended the night before. When we mentioned we were on our way to watch theday’s round of golf, she said blankly, “There’s golf?”)Both of those books were well received by critics andreaders. But, I related, I did hear from some readers who told me they wishedsomebody would write books that weren't necessarily set in some major lesbo-scene,but simply featured a lesbian protagonist going about her business in anordinary setting, solving crimes or whatever.OK, I thought, I’d like that too. So I wrote Lucky Stiff, in which protagonist LillianByrd solves the mystery of her parents’ long-ago deaths, with the help of herchildhood gay-guy friend Duane. Then I wrote Easy Street, where Lillian brings to justice a cute little thiefand murderer, with the action ranging all around the U.S.Reviewers with good literary taste loved the books andunderstood the essentially subversive, unconventional nature of my writing. “Herbest yet!” they chorused. But guess what? The books didn't resonate so wellwith my general readership, many of whom chorused, “She’s lost her way!” Saleslagged.Good God.“So the lessons I learned were several,” I told my audiencein Los Angeles that morning. “One, what readers say they want and what theyreally want might be two vastly different things. Two, an author should bechary of trying to accommodate readers’ requests anyway. And three, my nextLillian Byrd novel absolutely has to be about—” I paused for dramatic effect, “—softball!”Chris and the audience laughed so hard I feared everybodywould start squirting Starbucks through their noses. That was the mostgratifying moment of that whole convention for me, and from then on I knew forsure that Left Field lay somewhere inmy future.What do you think?

{"title": "My Inner Crack Whore", "date": "Thursday, March 26, 2015", "text": "Zestful Blog Post #98So last week I talked a bit about the demands of marketing /promo and the fact that an author must—somehow, somehow—strike a balancebetween it and everything else. In a way I feel I have a tin ear for it. Forinstance, today I cannot bring myself to give away e-copies of Left Field exactly as I promised lastweek. I said I’d give away copies to two lucky winners, selected at random,among those who posted a comment or sent me an email.As you will see if you look back, three Zestful Writing ClubMembers (which I consider you all) left comments, and a few more got in touchvia email.I considered claiming that the random number generatormalfunctioned and awarded prizes to everyone, but the truth is, I can’t letanybody down. So if you left a comment or emailed me, you’ll get a book. (Some of you I have email addys for; one of you I messaged on Google+.) Iguess if like fifty people had signed up I’d have to stick to my original plan,just because of the sheer administrative time involved. But maybe not.I recently read something by a marketing expert who workswith authors. We know that lots of authors don’t do adequate promo. This personsaid he thought those authors are ‘arrogant’ and they feel promo is ‘beneaththem’. I suppose some are and do.But for me, and I suspect for many others, the reasons aretwo:1) Marketing is a skill set. To do anything well—or at leasthalfway decent—you have to learn it. This requires, in my case:            a)admitting you have a problem;            b)committing to change;c) learning the skill set;d) applying the skill set. Whichtakes a boatload of left-brained effort, which is counter to the right-brainedeffort of creation us authors committed ourselves to long ago.[Sometimes it all feels so desperate...]2) The plain fact that most of us were brought up not toboast, not to thrust ourselves forward, not to make lofty claims for our workand actions, not to be insincere. I prefer to let my work speak for itself.Except that its voice—confident but quiet—gets drowned out by the digital cacophony,and so needs help.It is literally a physical and emotional struggle for me todo promo. I confess this not to elicit pity but to share a baffling thing. WhenI force myself to update my Amazon author page, or log into my (currentlypathetic) Goodreads profile, or even type a post onto Facebook or Twitter, or doany other sort of putting-my-self (and-work) into the world, or even JUST READAN ARTICLE about how to ‘interact with readers’, my stomach drops a little, mypalms sweat, and my heart starts to pound. I really don’t know what the emotionis: fear? If so, fear of what? Failure? Success? Is it that my brain hurtsbecause I have to use the left part instead of the right? I cling to mymembership in Mensa and my history as a part-time college math tutor, toconvince myself that I have at least some working left-brain molecules.Regardless, I will continue my quest to get good atmarketing and figure out ways to do it that don’t make me feel like a crackwhore. Or perhaps I simply need to embrace my inner crack whore. I bet she's a nice person, once you get to know her.What do you think?

{"title": "Free Book, and Promo-Itis", "date": "Thursday, March 19, 2015", "text": "Zestful Blog Post #97Hey, so we’re caught up on my publishing chronology,although I've not nearly exhausted every marvelous/entertaining/shockinganecdote. I’m sure I’ll unleash more in the future. Especially, I believe I'venot yet shared my inspiration to write LeftField, which involved a particular public conversation in Los Angeles. Ithink I’ll write that next week. For now, I promised to let you know how thattitle is doing.I published the book about ten weeks ago. It took off nicely,hovering around #1 on Amazon’s GLBT Mystery & Detective novel list, andappearing on Amazon’s ‘Hot New Releases’ list. It has since dropped back,awaiting more promo / marketing.Initially, I put the word out via my web site, this blog, myNewschat list, Facebook and Twitter, and did a Kindle Countdown deal a fewweeks in. I've done miscellaneous other promo—sending copies to reviewers andother professional connections, announcing the book on a few Yahoo groups, and doingthat Google+ Hangout with CocktailHour last month. The biggest bump in sales happened the day I sent out theNewschat.Yet to happen are possibly some free-promo days on Kindle,as well as some giveaways on different web sites, and other more targetedpromos. Will talk about those as they happen.But let the first giveaway be right here, to my faithfulblog chums!If you leave a comment on this post, you’ll be entered. Whatif you can’t leave a comment because Chrome or some other browser is giving youa hard time? Try either coming here via Internet Explorer, or shoot me an emailvia my web site: www.elizabethsims.com(select ‘contact’ from the top line). Just say in the email you’re entering theZestful blog giveaway, and then put in any other loving words you might wish toshare.Everybody who enters will be assigned a number, and just before posting next week's blog, I’ll usea random number generator (www.random.org) toselect two winners. If you win, I’ll ask for your email address, and whetheryou’d prefer your copy to be for the Kindle application (Mobi) or the BN one(Epub), or regular old pdf. If you already have a copy, you can give your prizeto someone else—I’ll just need their email addy and preference. You need not bepresent to win.Other notes: LeftField’s release boosted the sales of all my other titles, which is whatevery multi-book author lives for. When you see a big spike in sales from a newtitle, you get new-title fever, and all you want to do is put out your next,and your next, as fast as you can. But of course one must also consider whatone wants on one’s tombstone:THE BITCH COULD SELL BOOKSorTHE BITCH WROTE GREAT BOOKS[photo by ES]Needless to say, the bitch wants both. But one’s time is azero-sum game. Every hour you spend on promo work is an hour away from 1) yourwriting, 2) your reading, and 3) gaining fresh life experience. (Which is, like,supposed to fuel your art, right?)A balance must be struck.I feel proud of my work, but I know I’m far behind theleaders when it comes to marketing and promo. My background in the corporateworld has proved to be mostly irrelevant, because everything is different andconstantly changing in this digital age. I learned in-store marketingtechniques (that is, physical placement, etc.), I learned about paidadvertising, and about doing in-person appearances. Some of that has helped me,but mostly I’m learning on the fly like everybody else.Next week I’ll talk about my not-always-smooth relationshipwith promo, and will share that story about the genesis of Left Field.Leave a comment and enter to win!

{"title": "An Easy Choice", "date": "Thursday, March 12, 2015", "text": "Zestful Blog Post #96Remember a couple of weeks ago when I said a journalist hadinterviewed me for an article about the benefits of writing by hand? Thearticle came out on March 2, but I forgot to give you the link last week. Heretis:http://contently.net/2015/03/02/resources/writing-hand-underrated/The writer, Marianne Hayes, did a great job pulling togethermultiple sources in a concise piece. As I wrote to her when I thanked her, Itoo had read about Neil Gaiman’s preference for writing by hand. I still have abottle of Private Reserve Black Cherry ink that I bought after he mentioned heliked it. (One could imagine that it looks like dried blood on the page…) What do you think of the article?I feel this week’s installment of Elizabeth’s PublishingHistory will bring us more or less up to date. I’ll call it:#15 An Easy ChoiceIt’s funny, this whole sequence of posts on my publishinghistory is basically a long answer to the question of why I chose toself-publish a novel (Left Field,Book 5 in the Lillian Byrd Crime Series) after having achieved the (arguablyenviable) goals of:1) getting representation and2) having all of my prior books initially published by publishersof note.The capsule: I went the trad route; while some thingsworked out well, others did not; given the tools now available to authors whowant to control their whole process, it made sense to give it a go.In an earlier post I mentioned there was interest by tradpublishers in Left Field, but Ideclined to discuss anything with them. My reasons:1) I just plain wanted to see what would happen if I wentsolo;[Do you believe it's meinside that solo space-walk suit?!…]2) I wanted to keep the vast majority of the proceeds; and3) I wanted the up-to-the-minute sales information apublisher (or self-pubbed author) gets but an author who is merely part of herpublisher’s supply chain does not.As I’d already reissued all of my novels in Kindle e-bookform, I’d learned how that whole thing works. I’d run promotions (basicallyjust the ‘free days’ you can do with Kindle Select) and been gratified by the results.While preparing LeftField for publication in e-book and paperback forms toward the end of 2014,I also reissued my seven other novels in paperback on Amazon. This was no smalltask: I did all the design and formatting myself, worked with a graphic artiston cover designs, and handled all the steps for listing and releasing thetitles via Create Space. (I know Amazon omits the space betweenCreate and Space, but I atavistically write the two words as two words.) It's a painstaking process. As a Russian-born housecleaner once told me, \"To do a good job takes time.\"Why Create Space? Initially I thought I’d use LightningSource (not least because they represent their two-word name normally), but Idiscovered that the publisher’s cut of the list price per book is much smallerwith Lightning Source than Create Space. Knowing that the huge majority of allonline book sales go through Amazon, I elected to use Create Space, which stillleaves me the option of issuing the books via Lightning Source as well, forother sales outlets.Each in this series of publishing history posts has beenfairly long, circa 800 words or more, in order to catch us up. Now I’m gonnascale back to a more modest length.Next week I’ll tell you how Left Field is doing, and answersome questions I've gotten about marketing.What do you think?

{"title": "Invisible Threads", "date": "Thursday, March 5, 2015", "text": "Zestful Blog Post #95This morning, thanks to Google’sas-usual-incredibly-charming Doodle, I read about Momofuku Ando, the guy whoinvented instant ramen. A quote from him: “Each and every event in the past isconnected to the present by invisible threads.” How Japanese, I thought; in somany Western cultures we’re so eager to get to the future that we barelyacknowledge the present, let alone the past. And how appropriate to my subjecttoday.This week’s installment of Elizabeth’s Publishing History:#14 Invisible ThreadsAlthough I tell something about how I came to develop and writeYou've Got a Book in You in the bookitself, the very first germination of it occurred in a single unhappy moment.I had had four novels published (the Lillian Byrd books) andhad written a different kind of novel and was shopping it around to literaryagents, as I still didn't have representation. This was like 2005. I wasgetting turned down and was starting to get depressed. I called up my friendPhil, who, being a Hollywood actor, was by definition no stranger to rejection.When I whined out the story of my latest near-miss with an agent, he saidgruffly, “Good. That means she was the wrong one for you.”And I felt better (marginally) and I started thinking aboutall the various ways there are to cope with rejection, and I started to think Icould write something that other authors could benefit from. So for the hell ofit, I shot off an email query to Writer’sDigest magazine.[I could not find a public-domain photo of invisible threads, so here’sone of normal ones.Photo by ES.]They wrote back rejecting the coping-with-rejection idea butasking me to write an article on one of the little ideas I’d thrown in at thebottom of the email, the one about how to jump-start your writing when you’restuck.Thus began my career writing for WD. Instantly, I became anexpert on writing.When, as time went on, friends and strangers would ask mefor help with writing or getting published, I found that no book out there toldthe message that I was telling aspiring writers in my articles and over cups ofcoffee in conference-hotel concourses, which is that writing is an easypleasure. All you have to do is get out of your own way and let your naturaltalent and creativity take over. I realized I needed to write my own book,based on things I’d worked out for myself.I talked it over with Cameron, who agreed I had somethingunique to offer. She urged me to write up a proposal that she could shop to publishers.I had little doubt that she could find a publisher for it, but at this point(this was like 2011) would that be the best course of action? I'd been busyputting out my novels on Kindle, and already I felt addicted to Amazon throwingmoney into my checking account every month. Not that it was a lot, but it wasnice.Some other WD contributors were self-pubbing theircraft-of-writing material as well as trad-pubbing it, most of them with Writer’sDigest Books. So I talked with a couple of them, and they pretty much said, “Ifyou go the trad route first, you establish a good credential. Then you canself-pub more stuff and keep all the money.”Also, I talked to Cameron’s boss, Don Maass, the supreme guruof agentdom who was also a WD Books author. Of course he had a vested interestin me going the trad route, or putting out “a real book,” as he called it. Buthe made lots of objective sense, pointing out the wider distribution a tradpublisher can offer, as well as the numerous other opportunities that can moreeasily come your way if you’re with a publisher of note—things like speakinginvitations, private consulting, etc.So I went the trad route with You've Got a Book in You. Writer’s Digest Books, we knew, would bea logical home for it, but Cameron presented it to a number of other publishersas a matter of course. In the end, we went with WD Books. Although a separateentity from the magazine (under the parent company F+W Media), they knew me,and were immediately excited about the book.I will say that the publishing process was a bit rocky, withthe acquiring editor leaving the company halfway through the project, and a neweditor taking over, but these things happen, and you have to deal.Next week: Why I went indie with Left Field, and what’s coming up next.

{"title": "Home Front Madness", "date": "Thursday, February 26, 2015", "text": "Zestful Blog Post #94I’m writing this with pen and paper at my kitchen table andwanted to refresh my memory as to where I’d left off last week. Looking at myblog on my phone, it seems so—gosh, professional. Soon I’ll type this entry intomy laptop and it’ll be my standard draft-and-a-half, and good enough for jazz,as they say in the music biz.Recently I gave an interview to a journalist who is writingan article about how writing by hand is beneficial. She had read You've Got a Book in You (and nicelyhighlighted it in an article last year) and remembered that I’d put in somestuff about writing longhand. It was a fun interview, and during it I learnedthat writing longhand appears to be beneficial on the biochemical level, notjust the spiritual one, as I had believed. Will let you know when that articlecomes out.Winnie-way, as my old clarinet teacher used to say, during2010-2013, I had a lot going on personally and professionally.I’ll call this installment of EPH (Elizabeth’s PublishingHistory):#13 Home Front MadnessWithin the space of three years, Marcia and I experiencedthe partial destruction of our home on Washington’s Olympic Peninsula in a force-9storm, a cross-country move and attendant farewells to many dear friends, thedecline and deaths of both of our mothers, the dispersal of their households,the purchase and extensive renovation of a home, another, local move, tropicalstorm damage to that home requiring large-scale repairs, as well as the deathof another family member whose estate I was charged with distributing.[It took a fair amount of chainsawing and hauling before we could pull the cars out of the garage. Note wood smoke coming from stovepipe; since the power and phone wires were lying beneath that hemlock, the woodstove provided our heat and a cooking surface. Guess who slept on the couch next to the stove every night to keep it fed. This was actually 2009, Thanksgiving weekend.]Oh, plus the near death and lengthy hospitalization of yetanother family member, a heart scare for Marcia, and the beginning of aphysical issue for me that would culminate in surgery in 2014. If we’d had adog, I’m sure it would have gotten run over. But it wouldn't have died beforewe’d spent $5,000 at the vet and taken turns doing night shifts to administerround-the-clock medicine and supplements for three weeks.Meanwhile, we both did what we could to maintain ourcareers. While acting as primary caregiver for my mom, I wrote articles for Writer's Digest, taught online webinarsfor their organization, did reporting and photography stringer work for thelocal paper, auditioned for and got a place in a local symphony orchestra,worked as a private manuscript consultant, got my rights back to my novels,reissued them in e-book (Kindle) form, spoke and taught at writing affairs onboth coasts, and began work on Lillian Byrd #5 (Left Field).Also during that period I wrote a proposal for You've Got a Book in You, got under contractfor it, wrote it, saw it published, and did promo for it.Looking back on all that, even in its most skeletal form, Ican’t be surprised that I felt depressed and overwhelmed at times. I used tojoke about shooting myself in the head if one more goddam thing went wrong. ButI was careful to leave the firearms unloaded, which would have forced me totake the extra step of selecting and loading ammo, which hopefully would havegiven me time to reconsider.I feel that only recently has my life become more or lessstable. We have the freedom of working all day, every day, without having tofactor in 3 a.m. distress calls from panicked old ladies.Marcia is thrilled to be immersed in coding full time, and Ican’t wait to show off her new work when it's ready to ship. Apart from writing, I do my shoulderexercises, swim at the Y, and play a little golf. Florida is beautiful in thewinter. Hurricane season is just around the corner.Next week I swear I’ll tell the story of how You've Got a Book in You came about, andwhy I chose to go the traditional publishing route with it. After that, why Ichose to go indie with Left Field.But for now, Jesus, I’m exhausted.What do you think?

{"title": "Good News, Bad News", "date": "Thursday, February 19, 2015", "text": "Zestful Blog Post #93Good News, Bad NewsA bit of pre-new-post business:Frequent Zestful blog commenter LidyWilks is also a blogger in her own right. (And a highly accomplished one,too!) She sent along this Very Inspiring Blogger Award, which has becomesomewhat of a phenomenon on the Web. Lidy received the award from anotherblogger, who received it from another blogger, and so on back to 2009, when CatheHolden came up with the idea for bloggers to honor other bloggers. And nowLidy has very generously honored me with it.When you receive this award,the protocol is to:1) Thank the person who nominated you and include a link totheir blog. Thank you, Lidy! (LidyWilks)2) Send the award to other bloggers you admire, and puttheir links on your blog. Apart from Lidy, I follow Seth Godin and Jane Friedman, both of whom have receivedthis award numerous times. It is slowly penetrating my brain that the currentcustom is for bloggers to list the blogs of others on the sidebar of their blogsite, thus helping propagate worthy blogs, blogs, and more blogs. Perhaps Iwill do this someday.3) The third requirement varies, depending on whose blog you’relooking at. Some bloggers tell about what inspires them to write, other tellseven random facts about themselves, some list their fifteen most disgustingsexual fantasies, etc. I will say that I was inspired to write novels byreading bad novels and knowing I could do better. A random fact about me isthat I like to ask guys to tell me about fistfights they’ve been in. One morerandom fact: I would like to ride a horse or motorcycle across the Mongoliansteppes someday. A particularly disgusting sexual fantasy of mine involves pygmygoats and Diet Pepsi.On to today’s post!We'll call this one:#12 Good News, Bad NewsSo last week, I wrote about my self-funded book tour for The Extra, which resulted in some nicethings, but not enough sales in subsequent months for Macmillan to commit topublishing mass-market paperbacks.As of this point I had turned in the third in the series, On Location, and could look forward to ahardcover release of that. But then…I phoned Cameron and said, “What do we do now?”“What’s your idea for a fourth book in the series?” sheasked.I related the basic outline I’d developed so far, titled Best Boy.She said a mild curse word.“What’s the matter?”“Well, I was hoping it wouldn’t be a very good idea, and I’djust tell you to forget it and write something totally different—start a newseries. But that’s a great story forRita.” We discussed how hard it is to jump a series from one publisher toanother, unless your sales are already stratospheric. But Cameron said, “If you’llwrite a detailed outline and the first three chapters, I’d like to take a shotat selling it.”“It has to be one of the big six.”“Yeah. It’s an outside chance, but I really want to try.”So I took a few months and wrote up the material. WhenCameron and I decided it was wonderful, she set to work. This was by nowsomewhere in 2010.Cameron works fast. She phoned within days. “I’ve got goodnews and bad news.”At a moment like this, one simply waits.“The bad news is none of the other big six wants to take onthe series. But the good news is, four of them said, ‘We’d love to seesomething new from Elizabeth.’”The second half of a phone call like that is supposed to makeyour day. And it pretty much did for me. But while I was putting out the firstthree books in the Rita Farmer series, the digital publishing revolution wasthundering along. People like Joe Konrath were making a killing self-publishingon Amazon and writing about it and turning down six-figure deals from their oldpublishers, and author friends of mine who had self-published were urging me toget my rights back and reissue my books myself, and self-publish any new ones.So I set about doing that, keeping the idea of something newfor New York in abeyance.Meanwhile, after the first four Lillian Byrd books werepublished, around 2005, I’d begun writing for Writer’s Digest magazine, doing features on how to write well, andteaching live webinars.Also, meanwhile, the thing started to happen to me thathappens to all legit authors, which is whenever somebody asks you what you doand you say, “I’m an author,” they say, “Oh, I want to write too!” or “I’vewritten a book, but I haven’t been able to get it published. Will you help me?”Doubly so when they find out I write for Writer’sDigest.My articles in the magazine were supposed to address that,but I got tired of telling people, “Get a copy of Writer’s Market, like I did. Read it and get busy.”I started to get an idea for a new book, this onenonfiction. As you can see, I had a lot of balls in the air. More next week.What do you think?

{"title": "Touring Against the Odds", "date": "Thursday, February 12, 2015", "text": "Zestful Blog Post #92Last night I had a blast on Andy and Rev’s Cocktail Hour, myfirst truly live, unscripted online appearance. I've been on radio andtelevision a number of times, doing panels and interviews, and have done speechesand workshops that were recorded. My webinars for Writer’s Digest were all streamedlive, but those were scripted down to the minute. So this was actually a first.And now it’s on YouTube. With an opening screenshot that makes me look like Ijust crawled across the Sahara with the flu. I'm putting the link in even though I've only watched a few minutes of therecording, so throw me a gold star for bravery, please. The Link:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rnsoU9l9kZwAndy and Rev are fabulous, book-loving humans, so if youlike this recording or the others they’ve put up, consider letting them know bya comment or a share. Their web site: www.cocktailhour.us.They've got tons of other author chats and reviews, especially for the LGBTaudience.One more item of business: We’re doing a Kindle Countdowndeal on Left Field right now. You canget it for 99 cents through most of Friday (yes, lucky 13), thenit’ll go up by a buck a day until hitting its current regular price of $4.99. Ifyou've already acquired it at full price, thank you. I believe you can actuallydo a return, then re-buy it, if your budget is tight. No authors ever say thatpublicly, but I believe it’s true.I might add that as I write this, the book has regained the#1 spot on Amazon’s LGBT Mystery/Detectivelist, and three of the other four books in the series are in the top hundred onthat list. So, hey, promos do help!OK, back to my series on my publishing history (whichactually you’re seeing unfold before your eyes; someday I’ll catch up, Ipromise). We’ll call this one:#11: Touring Against the OddsOK, in 2009 TheActress paperback is canceled, and TheExtra is out in hardcover and e-book. My publicist at St. Martin’s Minotauragreed to book a bunch of appearances at bookstores for me for a two-weeksummer tour. As I mentioned last week, this was all on my dime except for someco-op promo with the stores, signage, and goodwill from Minotaur.My partner Marcia and I traveled by car from our then homein Washington state down to Los Angeles and back, doing drop-ins at more than thirtybookstores and doing about a dozen scheduled events, some with other authors. Ipromoted the appearances as best I could and let Providence take care of therest, as Huck Finn would say.What’s a drop-in, you might ask? That’s when you stop by astore, meet the staff and sign any stock on hand, give out bookmarks, and maybemeet a few customers as well. It’s best if you phone ahead to try to time yourvisit for when the appropriate buyer is on duty; I would ask, “Please tell methe name of your mystery buyer, I’d like to bring in a copy for him/her. Willhe/she be working tomorrow afternoon?” But I’ve also just dropped in cold withpretty good results.For chain stores, a cold drop-in is easiest. You just askfor the top mystery-lover on staff at the moment, give that person your freebook and chat them up, sign stock and leave bookmarks, and be on your way.[I love to surrender to the yellow lines...]We traveled as cheaply as possible; Marcia worked Priceline togreat advantage. Our biggest coup was a night at Dolce Hayes Mansion, thisincredibly luxurious boutique hotel in San Jose that was going for close to$300 a night. When I told the desk clerk we’d gotten our room for $70, she didn’tbelieve me.The tripyielded many good things. Apart from gaining exposure for my books, I made somelasting friends among booksellers, authors, and readers, and I learnedcountless little things to make drop-ins and appearances go smoothly andmemorably.However, independent bookstores were closing left and right,the chains were starting to have major difficulties, and online book sales weresurging, thanks to Amazon. So the relevance of book tours was starting to wane,and has continued to wane ever since.Although The Extragot a bump from my efforts (and TheActress, too, for that matter, in stores that carried lots of hardcovers), I learned, months later, that salesjust didn't justify a paperback for that title either. I had already turned in thethird in the series, On Location.My agent, Cameron, and I had a parley. The results of thatnext week.What do you think?

{"title": "Dude, You're Screwed", "date": "Thursday, February 5, 2015", "text": "Zestful Blog Post #91Before I get into today's real blog, I want to let you know abouta live online appearance: Next Wednesday, Feb. 11 at 8 p.m. (EST) I’ll be doinga Google Hangout with Andy and Rev on their Cocktail Hour. If you add them toyour Google+ circle you can watch and listen live. (Handy link here: https://plus.google.com/+CocktailhourUs1/posts)How it works is the url is available as soon asthe thing goes live, so if Cocktail Hour is already in your circle, you canjust go there at 8 next Wednesday evening and take it in. I'm sure I'll be brilliant. And aided, no doubt, by a Tanqueray martini, very dry, up, olives.I'll be talking a bit about Left Field, but if you have any questions/issues you’d like me to discuss about anything,let me know either by commenting on this blog or sending me an email. (esims atelizabeth sims dot com, no spaces and use the punctuation marks you wouldnormally; this is to defeat web spiders that search for email addys in blogsand then sell them to online porn stores, Nigerian royalty, etc.)Now for the next installment in EPH (Elizabeth’s PublishingHistory):10) Dude, You’re ScrewedLast week I wrote about the vagaries of the marketplace andcover design re: my debut mainstream novel, TheActress. I failed to mention that, just before the hardcover came out, Iwas informed by the Macmillan/St. Martin’s Minotaur marketing team that henceforth,Twitter would be the way we would all build community and do reader outreach. Ifound this dismaying, as I had detested Twitter as soon as it started toemerge, and had vowed never to establish a Twitter account. Theinsubstantialness of it, the quick shallowness of it, repelled me to the core.I had had my own web site for years, and had acquiesced to Facebook. (And Istuck with FB, even though they totally betrayed me; I had signed up early andwritten entertaining entries in the ‘background’ section of my profile, only tohave FB delete all that when they changed their business model. Bastards.Bastards.)But I dutifully established a Twitter account and made aneffort to promote myself and my work without seeming to promote myself and mywork. What a ton of fun. To this day social media is still a struggle for me,mostly because I’m like, Who in God’sname wants to hear my opinion on anything? The world is already full ofblowhards. I’m supposed to be another one, only more entertaining?However, I’m currently feeling a bit more dispassionate aboutit, like, OK, it’s business, try to find a sincere way to do this. I’m workingon it and will write more about this subject in the near future.Before returning to my narrative, I might add that when itcame to promo for The Actress, I didall the normal stuff: announced the book on my web site, sent out newschats tomy email list, printed up bookmarks to give out wherever I went, set up asigning at the Mystery Writers of America booth at Book Expo (and was invitedto MWA’s late-night cocktail party at The Edison in Los Angeles, a great placeto feel cool), went to and spoke and taught at other conferences and workshops,etc. But the Great Recession was a tough opponent.As far as I knew, the paperback of The Actress was in production; it had been put up on Amazon forpre-order with the new cover I showed you last week. The release date was March31, 2009. Two weeks before that date Cameron called. “I have bad news,” shesaid. “Minotaur pulled the plug on the paperback of The Actress.”Since this was business and not a death in the family, Ididn’t get emotional. But I knew exactly what had just happened. “So that’s it,then,” I said. “I mean, that’s the end of my career with Minotaur.” As a formerbookseller, I knew how important it was for an author to be in paperback. Thehardcover is your calling card, but the vast majority of your sales come fromyour paperbacks. Remember, at that time e-books were an unknown quantity in NewYork publishing.Cameron said my editor told her that she’d fought and foughtfor the paperback at whatever meeting, but ultimately there weren’t enoughadvance orders from booksellers to justify an initial print run.After I’d digested that news for a few days, I phoned myeditor. I asked if there was any chance they’d reverse their decision if salesof the soon-to-be-released second in the series, The Extra, were above expected.“Well, no,” she said. “There’s just not going to be apaperback of The Actress. We mightrun one next year for The Extra ifthe hardcover does well.”[Here again we have a blonde facing away from us, but this one's definitely better than the original cover for The Actress.]“OK,” I said. The gauntlet had been thrown down. I asked ifMinotaur would help me set up a book tour for The Extra. I knew they wouldn’t pay my expenses, but I wanted theirpublicists to get my foot in the door at bookstores, and hopefully provide someco-op marketing and signage. The answer was yes.More next week.What do you think?

{"title": "Subprime", "date": "Thursday, January 29, 2015", "text": "Zestful Blog Post #90Hi there! I hope you survived this week’s storm of thecentury. Here’s the next installment in EPH (Elizabeth’s Publishing History).Let’s call this one:9) SubprimeThe Actress wasreleased in the summer of 2008. Does this time period resonate in your memory?You betcha: the mortgage meltdown, the government bailouts of banks and GeneralMotors. (As a native Detroiter, I shake my head at that: in the days of tailfins and pushbutton radios, GM could have bailed out the government.) The darkdawn of the Great Recession.Just about everybody’s net worth went down a little or alot, and the most significant result was that people did not rush out to buy The Actress.I might add that they didn’t rush out to buy debuthardcovers by just about anybody else, either.The efforts of the Macmillan marketing machine were mighty (feltI ought to stick with the alliteration as long as possible there), and the bookdid sell some in stores and online, as well as, notably, to thousands oflibraries across the country. God bless all librarians everywhere. It stilldoes my heart good to hear from a reader who found my books in their local library(even recently in Canada, which surprised me, given that country’s restrictivecontent laws governing book sales (another subject)).Side note: It’s true that a library copy represents just onesale, and usually at a reduced royalty rate because publishers sell tolibraries at special discounts. Some authors actively scorn library sales. Iremember watching a filmed interview of James Ellroy during which he recounteda fan approaching him somewhere and gushing that she got L.A. Confidential out of the library and LOVED it. He said that he replied,“Well, that doesn’t do me a goddamned bit of good, does it?” But the point is,that library copy gained him a fan, and library fans will often buy thepaperback, or even the next hardcover because they don’t want to risk a waitinglist. James was perhaps not brought up to receive compliments gracefully.When the financial crisis got going, even before my book waspublished, I immediately thought, ‘This bodes ill for The Actress,’ and I was right.[Original cover.]My deal with Macmillan was for two books. As soon as Isigned the contract in 2007, I got right going writing the second in theseries, The Extra. So when The Actress came out in 2008, I hadalready turned in The Extra and theywere happy with it, and they offered me a contract for the third in the series.The plan was to release the mass-market paperback (that is,the small-format, pocket edition) of TheActress simultaneously with the hardcover of The Extra in 2009, about a year after The Actress’s debut. That is a common practice.The economic storm was rolling, but nobody knew how bad itwas going to be, nor how long the pain would last, so most publishers weredoing business as usual. I might add that Amazon was getting rolling on thisthing called, sinisterly, “Kindle”. TheActress and the other books in that season’s Macmillan catalogue were thefirst books published by that company in e-book format.When Macmillan saw that sales for The Actress were less than hoped, in spite of an almost uniformlyenthusiastic critical reception, one of their responses was to redesign thecover for the paperback. This was a great move, because the original cover hadissues.So, backing up to pre-hardcover release: I had expected thecover for The Actress to be kicky andbright, to suggest the biting humor and almost over-the-top plot, along thelines of chick lit. I know there’s a mystery and some graphic gore (what withmy killing off a main character, see Zestful Blog post #87), but I felt thebook was wacky and light too. I didn’t get such a cover, but when I first saw itI was thrilled, because compared with the original covers of the Lillian Byrdseries, which were predominantly black and pretty consistently horrible, it wasgood. It was professional.The cover told the story, we all thought: it showed, fromthe back, a blonde-haired woman (Rita, my protagonist) dressed in a businesssuit, facing a courtroom. The thing that only struck me after I’d lived withthe book staring me in the face in my office for a few months was that it wasnot a welcoming cover image. Someonestanding with her back to you does not draw you in; when you walk into a party,do you immediately approach someone with their back to you? Customers inbookstores are like party guests.So, a redesign was done. No, my opinion was not solicited; Ididn’t even know they were doing it until they sent a proof image to Cameron,who forwarded it to me.The redesigned cover still lives as a ghost on Amazon:http://www.amazon.com/Actress-Rita-Farmer-Mysteries/dp/0312377282/ref=tmm_mmp_title_0?_encoding=UTF8&sr=&qid=What happened to the mass-market paperback of The Actress?

{"title": "Throw the Baby in the Maw", "date": "Thursday, January 22, 2015", "text": "Zestful Blog Post #89Continuing on my journey through the publishing world, wehave this week’s installment:8) Throw the Baby in the MawThe baby, is, of course, one’s manuscript, and the maw isyour publisher’s machinery. Once the contract is signed, the maw opens.The main thing to realize about traditional publishing (orwhatever you want to call it; some call it ‘legacy’ publishing, which is abeautifully underhanded slap) is that the process takes a long time, even withthe ever-evolving digital technologies. Typically it’s a year from acceptanceto books-on-shelves, though publishers keep trying to shave this down, withspotty success.What has to happen before blastoff?[From my recent trip to Cape Canaveral.]A long list of stuff:Contract negotiations.These can take a day or weeks.Revisions. Youmight wait three months for your editor, once the contract’s in place, to sendyou his or her notes on suggested revisions. This go-round is often called a ‘lineedit,’ because the editor goes over your manuscript line by line, makingcomments and suggestions. They always want the thing back from you within a tighttime window, like two weeks.I’ve been lucky that the editorial process on all my bookshas been light. You can pretty much count on this: these days, if a book isn’tin pretty great shape, editors simply pass on it, with rare exceptions.I remember reading, before I got published, an account ofPat Conroy working with his editor, Nan Talese, on revisions. Reportedly theyholed up in a hotel together and went over his manuscript(s) for days and dayson end, with Talese massaging the material, helping with every aspect ofrewrites, etc. And I marveled, thinking hell, does she hold his dick for himwhile he pees? Talk about coddling. But when you’ve got a zillion-sellingauthor, I guess you do what you feel you need to. (I tried to find the sourceof that report for this post, but could not. It was back in the 90s as Irecall.)Copy edits. Thisis where a copy editor, who specializes on the molecular level of grammar,punctuation, spelling, and formatting, goes over everything. Some of them alsodo fact-checking; for instance, a copy editor once looked up a particularfirearm I mentioned, and told me it had been out of production for a few years.That was OK, since the gun didn’t have to be brand-new.I worked once in a situation where I was given (with nonotice) a weekend to go over copy edits for an entire book. The time pressureis because of their publishing schedule. For one example of a link in thechain, the publisher’s printer schedules jobs as tightly as possible. This isefficient. But if your book misses its slot, it might have to go to the rear ofthe queue, so to speak, so as not to throw off jobs all down the line. If youmiss your print date, you’ll miss your release date. So editors are hyper about their publishing timelines, andwhen the crunch comes, it’s usually on you.Final proofreading ofthe galleys. This is done by you. The galley is your book as it has beendesigned and typeset. That is, you’re looking at the exact product that will gothrough the printing press and be bound. Last chance to catch errors.I might add that sometimes copy editors will inadvertently add errors to your manuscript, as whenthey’re inputting all the agreed-upon changes. A period or a quote mark mightgo missing, so when proofing you have to really focus.More on the publisher’s side:Release date hasto be decided on, taking into account other books they’ll be releasing at thesame time.Marketing plan.Needs to be developed and groundwork laid for it.Cover design. You’llprobably have no say in this.Catalogue.Usually twice a year, publishers develop and release ‘catalogues’ oftheir upcoming titles to buyers at the bookstores and libraries, so these folkscan browse and decide what to pre-order, and how much.Galleys need tobe sent to reviewers; increasingly this is being done electronically.Printing andshipping. Of course e-book release is in here somewhere.On top of all this, you have to factor in weekends andholidays, everybody’s vacation time, maternity leave, knee surgery, etc. etc.,as well as slippage due to other authors missing their deadlines during the edit process and throwing your editorand thus everybody else off. (I plan to write more about the actually fairlyintriguing subject of deadlines in another post.)OK, next week we’ll see what happened when The Actress hit the stores.What do you think?

{"title": "Champagne", "date": "Wednesday, January 14, 2015", "text": "Zestful Blog Post #88When I left off last week, The Actress was on the verge of getting published. After I refusedto make drastic changes to satisfy a certain editor, she opted not to make anoffer.We'll call this installment:7) ChampagneBut another editor was interested; in fact, she very muchwanted to bid on The Actress, butcouldn’t get the marketing guys on board. (Cameron related this to me.) Theirfeeling was, nobody wants to read about people in Hollywood. Evidently they’dpublished a book along those lines that didn’t do well, so they nixed a dealfor The Actress.[A hazy day in the Hollywood Hills, photo by ES.]But yet another of the ‘Big Six’ wanted the book, and made anoffer. The way it works is: they make an oral offer on the phone to your agent;the agent calls you and discusses, then the agent calls them back to say yea ornay. Only the most basic things are discussed during the oral process: theamount of the advance, and just a few details about the back end. (An advanceis front end. Royalties after you earn out, any advertising/marketingarrangements, etc. are back end.)If more than one publisher is interested simultaneously, thebook ‘goes to auction’. That simply means the interested publishers are told byyour agent that there are multiple interested parties, and they’d better putout their best offer during a certain tight window of time, like three days.Auctions for hot, multimillion-dollar books sometimes take only hours orminutes.(When this offer came in, I was vacationing in Hawaii withfriends. Because of my phone call from New York, I delayed our morning a bit,enduring their impatience to get out and look at the damn volcano already. ButI’d worked for years to get to this point and was like, ‘Dudettes, you mustdelusional if you think I’m gonna cut this call short.’)We came close to an auction situation for The Actress, what with the firstpublisher (who wanted changes) being so hot for it, but in the end we got justthe one solid offer, which was for a two-book hardcover deal, and went withthat. The publisher was St. Martin’s Minotaur, a division of Macmillan.The whole process, from when Cameron started shopping thebook around to getting the offer from Minotaur, took only two weeks.Once the deal is accepted orally, the publisher draws up acontract and sends it to your agent, who sends it to you. (This one was done viaU.S. Mail, but eventually everybody has pretty much gone electronic.) Once you’veread it, you discuss it with your agent, and the agent gets back to thepublisher with the changes you both agree to ask for.Having negotiated my own contracts for my Lillian Byrdseries, I was familiar with the process, but the contract from Macmillan was muchlonger and more involved than any I’d seen before. Here is where Cameron earnedher percentage, by advising me on what we should and shouldn’t press for.Basically, a higher advance is always a good idea, but once you’ve gotten themas high as they’ll go (and without an auction you don’t have much leverage),you start talking about the back end. A good strategy is to ask for lower ‘bumps’in the royalty schedule.Say the contract says you’ll get ten percent of sales forthe first fifteen thousand copies, then twelve and a half percent for the nextfifteen thousand, then fifteen percent for the rest of all copies for eternity.You agent can ask for the first bump to be at ten thousand or seventy-fivehundred, and so on, so that you’re eligible to make more total money on thebook, sooner. You can ask that your highest percentage be bumped to twentypercent, stuff like that, as well.You won’t get everything you ask for, but like an annoyingcorporate vice president I once worked with used to say, “Don’t ask, don’t get.”So now is the time to ask away. More next time. Thanks for looking in.What do you think?

{"title": "A Rock in the (Main)Stream", "date": "Thursday, January 8, 2015", "text": "Zestful Blog Post #87I hope the holidays treated you well. I'm pleased with how Left Field is doing, but I have much more promo work to do. This week we’re back to my journey through the publishingworld. This post necessarily contains spoilers from Holy Hell and The Actress.But they’re worth it, baby.Let’s call this installment:6) A Rock in the (Main)StreamIt took me about a year to write The Actress, then I sent it to Cameron (McClure, at the DonaldMaass agency, who had expressed interest in the idea; see post #84). She likedthe book a lot and offered to represent me. At the time, she was fairly new atDon’s agency. Before agreeing, I asked her why she thought she was right forthe job.“You already know I think you’re a great writer,” she said. “I’myoung and hungry, and Don’s reputation opens all the doors for us.”I said that sounded good. She replied, “From now on, it’s myjob to be a bitch on your behalf.”Such lovely, lovely music.Some agents are hands-off and never make editorialsuggestions; others are quite involved with their clients’ projects. I foundthat Cameron was into making suggestions. She got back to me with a long memoon The Actress, known as ‘notes’.This is the same thing as in Hollywood, where the producer or director orwhoever tells the scriptwriter “I have some notes for you.” This can beominous, signaling a horrifying ordeal for the writer, or it can turn out to bea most helpful, cooperative kind of thing.Fortunately, I felt Cameron’s notes were valuable. While Irejected some of her ideas (which she insisted upon knowing reasons for), Iadopted many of them, and the book became stronger for it.I might note that early in the process, even before I wrotethe whole book, one of Cameron’s suggestions was to kill off a main character. “becauseonce you do that,” she explained, “your readers will never feel safe.” So Imade sure to kill off a main character in TheActress.During this, I reflected that in Holy Hell, my first title with Alyson Books, I made an opposite move.When my editor there got down to work on the book, she called me and said, “Youknow, I really think you shouldn’t [spoiler alert] kill off Minerva LeBlanc.She’s such a great character. Think what you could do with her in future books!”I said, “Well, that’s the way the story goes. I needed adead body to be found in Lillian’s apartment so suspicion falls on her and shehas to deal with it. Like, you know, I’ve put her up a tree and now I’mthrowing rocks at her. I wrote Minerva solely so I’d have an appealingcharacter to kill off for this purpose.”“Well, couldn’t you put her into a coma or somethinginstead? So at least you have the option of bringing her back in the future?”I thought for a minute. “Yeah, I could do that. I could haveMinerva be viciously attacked in Lillian’s apartment while she’s away, and itwould be attempted murder instead of murder, and Lillian would still be thenatural first suspect for a serious crime.”“OK, that’d be great.” And that’s how it worked out.When both Cameron and I felt The Actress was in top shape, we discussed strategy. She knew Iwanted a contract with a big publisher, so she prepared a list of the top ten,as well as a pitch email and so forth. I did not ask to see her pitchmaterials, trusting her to get the job done.I didn’t have long to wait.A few days after she started telling publishers about mybook, she phoned me. We’d gotten one no-thanks from one of the ‘big six’, butanother was expressing serious interest. Great, right? Just one hitch.[Rocks make it dangerous--but fun.]An editor for this publisher’s main crime-fiction imprinthad read The Actress. She toldCameron, “I read the first half and thought it’s fabulous! I jumped up and randown the hall to our contract department and said, ‘We’ve got to put together aoffer for this book! It’s terrific!’ Then I went back to my office and read thesecond half. When I got to [spoiler alert] Gary’s death, I went, ‘Oh, no! Shecan’t kill off Gary! Rita and Gary have to get married and then solve crimes inthe courtroom together!’”This editor asked Cameron to see if I’d be agreeable tochanging the book and the trajectory of the series. “What do you think?”Cameron asked.This was a tough situation, but I said, “Well, no. I mean, Icould put Gary into a coma”—hey, with one hand tied behind my back, lots ofexperience with coma-inducing injuries here—“and have him recover in the nextbook, but this can’t be a lawyers-together courtroom series.” I had initiallyconceived of a series of linked stand-alones, with some characters recurring,and I wanted to go forward with that. I wanted the next in the series tofeature a different protagonist from Rita Farmer.Cameron said, “Every editor who sees this says it absolutelyhas to be a series starring Rita. Everybody wants to know what happens to hernext.”“Well, I guess I could keep Rita as the main character, butI don’t have the background to write a lawyer/courtroom series, nor do I wantto. I want [spoiler alert] Rita and George [the private eye in the story] to betogether at the end of this one, and I’d be comfortable writing them workingtogether going forward. I’m going to put Rita into law school, because she’s sointerested in law after this one, but she’s not going to have a career as alawyer. Maybe she’ll flunk out or something, I don’t know yet. I can write heras an actress, but not as a lawyer.”Cameron explained all this to the big-shot editor, who saidsadly that she wouldn’t be making an offer on the book after all.She was sad. Righto.However, Cameron had already heard from another couple ofeditors who were very interested in the book.And we’ll have more on that next time. This is gettingpretty detailed, but I feel the full story is worth telling.What do you think?

{"title": "Moving Into the Mainstream", "date": "Thursday, December 18, 2014", "text": "Zestful Blog Post # 84The series about my publishing history continues today.5) Moving Into the MainstreamWhen an artist belongs to some sort of minority, that artistmust decide what kind of art to make. Shall I make art that I think/guess/hopewill be understood/appreciated/purchased by a mainstream audience, or shall Iproduce something that speaks more specifically to my own smaller group,whatever that is, and take the risk of obscurity? Shall I be myself, or pretendto be someone else?Leaving aside the question of figuring out one’s identity(which can take a lifetime right there), this can be a challenge. CharlotteBrontë, for instance, knew that in the male-dominated public sphere of hertime, female authors were “liable to be looked upon with prejudice” and thuswrote Jane Eyre under the male nameCurrer Bell. She was just one of many female, or black, or Jewish (etc.)authors who concealed their personas in order to come across as one of themainstream.A main stream, with tug. [photo by ES]Some authors who were gay / lesbian / bisexual or otherwisenot part of the bicameral sexual culture have written books strictly aboutstraight people and their lives. And some have been criticized for it by thepolitically-correct contingent. A subject for another post, perhaps. Incidentally,I believe a lot of gay writers who didn’t want to come out turned to mysterywriting, because you can write gripping stories that have little to do withcharacters’ inner lives.Finding some success with my Lillian Byrd series, I hungeredfor a larger audience. That could be achieved if I got published by a majorhouse. And the major houses wanted, almost exclusively, mainstream stuff.While trying to get HolyHell published, I wrote a mainstream novel about the bookselling scene,which sparked some interest among the agents I queried, but again no offers forrepresentation. So when strategizing again about getting picked up by a majorpublisher, I left aside that book and decided to write another novel, a mainstreammystery. This was a business decision.The story, called Crimesin a Second Language, involves a retired schoolteacher who befriends herLatina cleaning woman by offering to teach her English. Their developingfriendship leads to trouble with the cleaner’s husband, who appears to beinvolved in some dark business. And so on.I sent excerpts to agents, and finally heard from CameronMcClure at the Donald Maass agency. “I can tell you’re a great writer,” shesaid, “but I don’t think I can sell this book. Do you have other ideas?”Yes, I did. I sent her a batch of three or four ideas forcrime / mystery novels, including a series of linked stand-alones, and she gotback to me with some enthusiasm. She loved the concept of The Actress, in which a struggling actress is approached by ahigh-end defense attorney to coach his client, an unsympathetic society mom who’sup for the murder of her own daughter. The actress is a divorced mother of alittle boy, with a gay best friend and a nasty ex-husband lurking in thebackground. “If you can write this one,” Cameron said, “I think I can sell it.”So I spent a year on the project, and sure enough she didsell it to a major publisher. There’s a story to that, which I’ll detail nexttime.What do you think?

{"title": "Breaking Through", "date": "Thursday, December 11, 2014", "text": "Zestful Blog Post #83If you’ve been following this blog, you know I’m writing aseries of posts about my publishing history. Herewith today’s installment:4) Breaking ThroughWeary of querying agents who failed to recognize mybrilliance, I set about querying publishers directly. This ruled out thebiggest ones in New York, who only took agented submissions. I queried some ofthe smaller mainstream publishers, but none were interested. How to get through that brick wall between me and publishingsuccess?The leading LGBT publisher at the time was Alyson Books,named after its founder, Sasha Alyson. The editors there were discriminating,they paid advances, and they published most of the top authors. Unsurprisingly,their authors’ books sold well and won awards, most notably the Lambda LiteraryAwards, aka the Lammys.A rung down from Alyson, for my purposes, was Naiad Press, awomen-only concern that published broadly (OK, pun intended), did not payadvances, but published some significant books and fostered many a career. Anumber of authors started out with Naiad, then switched to Alyson once theybecame better known. The co-founder and publisher, Barbara Grier, was committedto the feminist/lesbian literary cause. She was outspoken, loved and feared,she was a good businesswoman, and many authors and readers are grateful to thisday, years after her death.I felt that Holy Helland the sequels I intended to write, would be a good fit for Alyson, sologically I should have approached them first.But was I logical? No, I was insecure. I had felt the slingsand arrows of outrageous rejection. I believed that Naiad, which in my opinionpublished lots of crap along with their good stuff, would surely go mad for thequality of writing in Holy Hell. Iwanted the sure thing. So I sent in a query, and as I expected, received aletter of interest asking for an exclusive look at the whole manuscript. I sentit.[Gotta break it…]A few weeks later the phone rang. My partner, Marcia,answered it. “I'm calling for Elizabeth Sims,” said a gruff voice on the line. “Thisis Barbara Grier. Do you know who I am?”“Yes, I do,” answered Marcia. She ran to tell me.Barbara Grier herself!Surprised, flattered, and thrilled, I closed the door to myoffice and took the call.“Hello, Ms Grier.” I picked up a pen and made notes of theconversation, having gotten into the habit of doing that for important businesscalls.“Well, you have some talent,” she began without preliminaries.Her tone was not, however, one of encouragement. She sounded like a womansuffering from a grave disappointment.Barbara explained that she gave the manuscript to three ofher “readers”, as was her protocol. Their report: one felt “lukewarm” about thebook, the other two were frankly thumbs-down.“It's just not a good book,” she said bluntly.I felt dismayed but not crushed. I listened carefully,determined to glean whatever wisdom I could from this highly experiencedpublisher, who cared enough to phone me and talk. Maybe she'd suggest I makesome changes and submit it again. “You obviously don't understand how to writea good lesbian novel,” she went on. “You don't understand what women should bereading. This main character of yours—”“Lillian Byrd,” I interjected.“She gets herself into all these dangerous situations—I meanreally life-threatening situations—and that's not the kind of message women should be hearing.”“Really?”“Really.”“I see.”The whole point of HolyHell was to let Lillian learn things the hard way, thus entertaining myhoped-for readers. But the book's black humor was completely lost on Barbaraand her staff. I realized that she and I were unlikely to find much commonground.Barbara paused, and I got the impression she was referringto some notes. “She goes into these dark alleys, I guess. Right?”“Right. It's a crime novel.”“She gets shot!”“Right.”“That's stupid! That's just stupid to have her do that!”At this point I had to bite my finger to keep from laughing.Barbara paused, as if waiting for a response. But I couldn't think of anythingto say. I certainly wasn't going to try to defend my work to someone who was soprofoundly missing the point.“Well, let me give you some advice,” Barbara said at last.“Yes, please do.”“You should find a writing group. Like I said, you've gotsome talent, but you have a long wayto go.” “Mm.”“We publish a lot of lesbian books.”“Yes, I know.”“We don't give advances, and frankly, I've never seen a bookthat deserved one. But our books sell. Our hottest-shit writer, Claire McNab,makes a good living! You could too, if you learned a few things.”After hanging up, I let my laughter out. The conversationhad been so ludicrous, and Barbara's belief—that women shouldn't read fictionabout a woman who blunders into dangerous situations—was so stunningly idiotic,so patronizing, that laughter was the only possible response.I opened the door to my office and went to find Marcia.“She hated it!” Iannounced.Marcia, seeing me smiling, thought I was joking.“No, she really hated it.” I related the conversation.“She called totell you that?” Marcia couldn't believe it. We dissolved into laughtertogether. How bizarre! How insane!After that, I decided to go to the top of the quality heap,Alyson Books. They read my query and asked to see the manuscript. I sent it,they loved it, offered me a contract (with an advance!), and published it.Before the book went to press, I inserted a scene near theend in which Lillian Byrd's ex-girlfriend scolds her for getting herself intosuch awful trouble. She uses the same words Barbara Grier said to me in thatphone conversation. Just my private little f*ck-you to Barbara, though I doubtshe ever saw it.Holy Hell sawthree printings between 2002 and 2006, and has continued to sell steadily in e-bookform. (I’ll soon release a new edition of the paperback.) Holy Hell's sequel, DamnStraight, won the 2003 Lambda Literary Award for best lesbian mystery. Iwrote two more books in that series, LuckyStiff and Easy Street, before decidingI wanted to break into the big time.That story next time.What do you think?

{"title": "A Flower Watered With Tears", "date": "Thursday, December 4, 2014", "text": "Zestful Blog Post #82Last week I said that HolyHell took a long time to write, and a longer time getting published. Here’smore on that. I’ll call this installment:3) A Flower Watered With TearsSo I was working for Borders as a floor clerk, shelvingbooks, ringing up books at the registers, gift-wrapping books (yeah, really, olden days) andthinking, as I pushed package after package across the counter, This could be me. This could be me.I saw how well the pulpy novels in the gay-lesbian section soldand thought I could toss off a novel along those lines. Frankly, I thought Icould bring better quality to the genre, which was notorious for low standards.I figured if I could get one published and start building a backlist of potboilers,I could perhaps have a career as an author. Then I could branch out into otherkinds of fiction—literary stuff, which might not sell very well. Incidentally,I find a lot of authors don’t know what the term potboiler means. It’s prettyliteral: work that sells reasonably well because it’s pleasing to populartastes, thus it keeps the soup pot boiling on the back of the stove so you canbe a well fed artist instead of a starving one.[I like to draw too.]I worked on Holy Hellon and off for the last eight of the ten years I was with Borders. During thattime I got promoted from floor clerk to assistant manager to general manager.Then I got a major promotion to regional director in charge of West Coastexpansion, which required a move to San Francisco. A busy, exciting time! Iflew around the West, hiring and counseling managers and opening stores. Atthat level, you have precious little time for creative projects; you’re writingemails in your hotel room at eleven-thirty at night, and when you’re homeyou’re doing your laundry and paying bills. In the space of six months I earnedsuper-premier status on two airlines (United for north-south, Northwest forwest-east). I used to wake up in hotel rooms not remembering which city I wasin, and having to get up, open the drapes, and look out the window to get itstraight. Portland was the easiest, because our travel coordinator always bookedme in a room in the downtown Marriott with a view of Mt. Hood. Seattle: SpaceNeedle. Anchorage: Lake Spenard. And so on. My novel languished.One day my boss called and said he wanted to talk to meabout another opportunity within the company, but it would involve a move backto Ann Arbor (the homeland). I knew that was code for ‘vice president ofsomething or other’, which would have been nice. But the internal pressure tobe an author was building. So I said, “Don’t tell me about it. I want to stayin California.” And I knew it was time to commit to my writing.Meanwhile, the company was changing in ways I didn’t like, andI left Borders soon after that conversation. I had stock options, only some ofwhich were vested. The value of the options I left behind was a little over$300,000. This caused me some lost sleep until the stock price droppeddrastically months later due to overexpansion and the Amazon effect, and myformer colleagues saw their retirements go up in smoke. This was around1997-98.I worked on Holy Helland got it into what I felt was publishable shape. I started querying literaryagents without immediate success. While I kept at that, I wrote a new novel,this one based on my experiences in the bookselling business. This took acouple of years.A few agents nibbled seriously at Holy Hell. One highly successful one asked for an exclusive look atthe manuscript, then got back to me and said the story got going well, butended poorly. I was a ‘such a great writer,' this agent said, and it was a pitythey had to decline this book. Several other agents seemed interested, thenultimately said no.The most instructive experience was with a New York agentwho took a look at the manuscript and phoned me to talk about it. If I couldmake the plot more complex and increase the length (from I think about 55,000words to more than 65,000), she thought she could sell it to one of the bigger publishers.I said I could do that, and we chatted amiably about life and books, finding wehad many things in common. I felt this woman could become not only my agent,but my friend. Moreover, I was excited to learn she might be able to place thebook NOT with one of the niche publishers known for LGBT pulp, but with apublisher with higher standards and a broader reach.So I set to work, and three months later got in touch. Therewas a slightly different tone in this agent’s voice, which aroused my anxiety,but she told me to send her the manuscript. (This was still in the days when everything was done viaU.S. post. Things were starting to change, though, with higher-speedconnectivity that soon allowed for a book-length file to be sent and receivedwithout tying up your system for half a day.)Shortly after she received the manuscript, the agent phonedme. As soon as I heard her voice, I knew something was wrong. The book waswonderful, she said. I listened guardedly. She said I’d done exactly what she’drequested, and gosh, the manuscript turned out great.Right. OK. Listening.But except. Except. “Except I signed another author twoweeks ago, with a book that’s somewhat like yours. So we really can’t take youon. I’m sorry.”Sorry didn’t begin to describe how I felt, given the height of the stack of rejection letters I’daccumulated by then. But I thanked her politely for her time and, after lettingmyself feel absolutely horrible for a few hours (including pleading with Godfor a sign), then positively crappy for a few days, then fairly down for a fewweeks, decided I needed to take a different course.Publication is near.What do you think?

Just heat ’n’ serve.As promised, here’s more of my publishing history, all ofwhich has informed my decision to launch an imprint and self-pub my next novel.I’ll call this installment:2) Training as a WriterAfter getting my degree in English from Michigan StateUniversity, I went to work at a small weekly newspaper in the Detroit area. I’mleaving the name out, because I’ve spoken in public about my boss’s (unwelcome)sexual advances, and in any event the paper is long defunct. I don’t know wherethat boss is today, but I did learn a lot from him, regardless of his cluelesspersonal behavior.Being a community journalist was a terrific education, waybeyond anything college could have provided. You learn how a newspaper works,how a city works, and how a city reallyworks. In many small papers, the reporters are young and green, and I was that.I remember being shocked to see decisions made by public officials (elected andappointed) that went against the public good because of some City Hall dickfight or other. I remember being incredulous at how people—citizens, officials—wouldform firm opinions on acutely important issues based on information they knewto be incomplete. I learned that integrity in the public sphere does exist, however,and it’s rare.I did reporting, photography, and editing. The most valuablestuff I learned was how to write concisely and how to edit for brevity andaccuracy. Also, of course, how to write under pressure of an inviolatedeadline. Being young and anxiety-free, I never sweated if I didn’t have afront-page story as deadline morning approached; something always turned up.After leaving the paper to take a finding-myself trip aroundthe country, then knocking around in different jobs, all of which requiredwriting (training-materials writer, tech writer, etc.) I wound up selling booksfor a couple of guys named Tom and Louis Borders. I wrote short stories andsent them around. Wrote a short novel which I set aside, knowing it wasn’t reallypublishable. Had a few stories published in another Detroit-based literaryjournal, Moving Out, which was aby-and-for-women venture. I served on their editorial board for a couple ofyears, then eventually the thing dissolved. This was in the late 1980s.[John King’s used bookstore in Detroit, where I bought manya cheap read, and still do, whenever I get to town. Photo by ES.]Simultaneous with starting to work for Borders (at thesecond store they built, in Birmingham, Michigan), I enrolled at Wayne StateUniversity in Detroit for my master’s in English, specializing in compositiontheory. I thought maybe I should become a professor, but I eschewed the MFAprogram for two reasons:1) I was wary of anybody telling me how to write; and2) I thought the composition theory program, once I got my Ph.D,would foster more job opportunities.But I discovered a much different school environment than Ihad expected. For instance, when I challenged a professor’s ideas in a paper,he wrote me a letter suggesting I drop his class. But I did have profs withnormal-sized egos too. The main problem for me was academic writing: I justcouldn’t get over how stilted and opaque most of it was. I was like, I’m supposedto be learning how to help students write well, and my class texts are this, and I’m supposed to write the sameway?One day the book editor for the Detroit Free Press asked my boss at Borders if he could recommendanybody on staff to write book reviews, and he suggested me. So I wrote reviewsfor them for a couple of years, which was really cool, because I got paid $100or $150 per review, plus I got lots of free first editions. RIP book page ofthe Freep.Wayne State holds an annual writing contest, the TompkinsAwards (with cash prizes), for its students, and for the hell of it I enteredmy not-ready-for-publication novel, Thingsto Come, in the graduate division. It won, to the chagrin (I learned) ofthe MFA students. I felt validated as a fiction writer, but I didn’t doanything more with that manuscript. Mainly the reason was that at Borders I was busy discovering that I had a talent for managing people, and I was enjoying learningabout the world of retail and business. Plus I wasn’t sure whether I had whatit took to be a real novelist. Plus I had to pay the rent.Regardless, I did begin another novel, the beginning ofwhich was based on my experiences at the newspaper. I called it Holy Hell, and I was a long time gettingit done, and a longer time finding a publisher. But those things happened, andI’ll write about that and more next week.Is your house starting to smell great yet?

{"title": "Why Spruce Park Press?", "date": "Thursday, November 20, 2014", "text": "Zestful Blog Post #80Last week I mentioned that I’m doing revisions on andpreparing to self-publish my next novel, LeftField. The ‘long-awaited’ fifth in the Lillian Byrd series, Left Field opens with Lillian doing odddetective jobs for a pair of odder recluses in one of Detroit’s last remainingprestige neighborhoods. After spotting a corpse on the next-door lawn, she…well, more on the story soon. Today I’ll be talking publishing.I’ve heard from readers who wonder why I’m publishing under myown imprint, Spruce Park Press. Funny, I sat down and tried to answer that in ablog-postable 400-600 words, but found I had to compress and omit way too much, including how I got my first publishing contracts and representation.The micro version is simply this:There are a number of established publishers who haveexpressed interest in Left Field oranything in the LGBT line I might write. I run into them at conferences, orthey email me or put out a feeler via a common friend. But none of them offers terms I want.That’s the short, literal answer, and it’s rooted, of course,in the digital revolution. How did I arrive at this point?[The logo for my imprint, designed by TreeHouse Studios. Ilove it so much I’m thinking I might want to do more with it, like publishothers someday.]For a long time I thought my publishing history wouldn’t engrossanybody, thus I omitted it from this blog. But when I get to talking informallywith aspiring writers, especially novelists, I find that they are acutelyinterested in the twists and turns of my career, and they find my perspectivehelpful—to the point of grabbing the front of my shirt and demanding to knowmore. Think you’re the only one with publishing heartache? Look no further!Stick with me.I’ll give you some detail and flavor of the whole enterprise,while keeping things chronological and more or less concise. The point is thatmy actions and decisions today all are based on my experiences. So here’s thestory of my experience. The first installment today, more to come.1) First PublicationsLike many young people with literary ambitions, I gotstarted writing poetry and short fiction, and had my first publications withthose. In undergrad school at Michigan State I submitted all over the place,including the New Yorker, which waslaughable, but they actually sent me a handwritten no-thank-you. (Aiming highnever hurt anybody, I firmly believe. Aiming low, however, is a differentstory.)Eventually I had some poems published in the Detroit-based literaryjournal The Smudge, edited by DouglasMumm and Kurt Nimmo. (Where are they today? Thank you, guys.) I remember standing in my dorm room opening that firstacceptance letter and howling with excitement. The girl in the next room camerunning in, fearing I was killing an animal. Hey, I told her, I’ve just skippedover the school literary journal and gone right to the hardscrabble level of anindependent magazine. They want three of the six poems I sent! They want aphoto of me!So I enlisted a guy I was dating to shoot some black-and-whitepictures of me looking dramatic in a dark alley, beneath a cone of grainylight. I sent those in, but the editors wrote back saying they wanted somethingmore legible. Perhaps some shots of me indoors under better lighting? So wetried again, and the result was a picture of me smiling enthusiastically, as ifsomeone had just told me I was really smart. This was in the late 1970s. Inspite of my best efforts to suppress it, my birth date is now publicinformation, so I might as well be honest about my vintage. The Smudge was, like many an underfundedjournal, short-lived, but it gave me affirmation and confidence.More next week, which will span quite a few years and bring us upto the publication of my first novel, HolyHell.Speaking of poetry, here’s something from one of our fellowzestful writers, Lidy Wilks. Her new book of poetry, Can You Catch My Flow?, is available here.I’ll be glad to share your link too.

{"title": "Experience with a Recent Edit", "date": "Thursday, November 13, 2014", "text": "Zestful Blog Post #79Fans of my four-book Lillian Byrd series of crime novelswill be pleased to learn that the fifth, LeftField, is almost ready for release. (People who hate the series will not bepleased, and will perhaps spend several minutes staring at their shoes beforegetting on with their lives.)Given that I'm publishing the book under my own imprint,Spruce Park Press (more on that next week), I considered releasing it aftermaking it as good as I possibly could. Who would know better than I? After all,I'm an editor myself—I've been a newspaper editor and corporate writer, and mytitle at Writer's Digest is Contributing Editor. I've done developmentalediting for select clients and have judged literary competitions.To be sure, when it comes to one's own work, one sometimes does know best. I've submitted shortstories to magazines and anthologies that got published with negligible editing,not to mention newspaper and magazine articles. I know some self-published novelistswho don't get their stuff professionally edited, yet sell lots of copies inspite of it.Yeah, I say 'in spite of it.' Because novels are different.They're long and they're complicated, and by the time you'vetyped 'The End' you're like Jackson Pollock looking at one of his own paintingsfrom a distance of two inches.I suspected I was too close to my material to view itobjectively, and I'd also come down with CRD, or Creeping Rot Disease, which isa disorder characterized by the conviction that your book is irredeemably horrible.It strikes all authors at least once per book, even experienced ones. ActuallyI knew my novel couldn't be irredeemably horrible, but I was fatigued with theproject. What if I'd missed something critical? My manuscripts are very clean, butsometimes even I make a grammatical goof or misuse a word. Left Field is complex, with several subplots and lots of action.Moreover, what if a trusted editor came up with some ideas—small or big—that couldmake the book better?The thing is, a good editor—emphasis on good; many aremediocre and I wouldn't trust them with my grocery list—doesn’t merely help youimprove your book. A good editor helps you learn to be a better writer. Youread over the edited manuscript and see from another person's perspective. Yougo, \"Oh, yeah!\" when you come across a valuable comment, correction,or suggestion. Your perspective broadens and your understanding of good writingdeepens.I'm experienced enough to be able to read an edited versionof my book and pick and choose what I want to change. (No writer agrees 100%with any editor, because editing is in part subjective.) So I called up myfriend Angela Brown, who in her capacity as Editor-in-Chief for Alyson Books whenit was the leader in LGBT publishing, edited all four of the first Lillians.She happily agreed to be my editor again (for a fee, of course).What I got out of it:1) Affirmation that LeftField is a brilliant book and I'm a true professional.2) I had made no mission-critical mistakes.3) I had, however, made several errors in continuity andusage.4) Suggestions for improvements and clarifications, likeword choice (I used 'muttered' too many times) and grammatical constructions('We were friends,' changed to 'We had been friends,' for clearer meaning in aparticular passage, for instance.) Also requests for more detail in someplaces.5) Plot-level suggestions on making things stronger, suchas: 'As a reader I wanted some kind of happier ending for [X character].'Authors who want to pinch pennies and rush their material tomarket shouldn’t consider hiring a professional editor. But if you really careabout your readers' experience and if you care about your legacy as an author,do everybody a favor and hire some help. After all, you will be dead sooner orlater. Let readers 200 years from now read your book and tell their friends,\"I just discovered this! It's FABULOUS!\"What do you think?

{"title": "Lost & Found", "date": "Thursday, November 6, 2014", "text": "Zestful Blog Post #78Today let us speak of the things around the edges of life. Lostthings, detritus, discards. Everything tells a story—or could, in your hands.We can't give everything in the world around us our deepattention every minute; we're constantly making thousands of conscious and unconsciouschoices as to what to pay attention to. But a way to develop as an author—or artist, craftsperson,inventor, human being—is to be open. That is, to give some consciousness to thestuff around the edges.Something catchesyour eye. You can categorize it and move on,like especially if you're running late for a therapy appointment. Or you canpause and let that edge thing register a bit more deeply.My friend Sandra Moran, a prizewinning author, routinelystops and photographs interesting litter. At first I thought, \"That'scool,\" then I decided it wasn't, because maybe it makes you keep your headdown too much. Plus litter tends to be dirty, and who likes looking at dirtystuff all the time?Then, recently, I was walking through a parking lot andnoticed a lost baby sock on the ground. I stopped, looked, and took a picture.ActuallyI took two. Because somehow I saw potential,even apart from the purely visual aspect of the composition of the soft baby socklying on the rough macadam. My heartbrain was stimulated, I saw story, I sawpossibility.There's the story of the sock itself—spun and woven in amill somewhere, according to a pattern devised by some baby-sock designer, thenmated with an identical twin, packaged, shipped, shelved, and purchased.There's the story of the baby, the mother and father, thefamily. Is the family poor, and will this lost trifle cause hardship? Did thebaby kick it off or did a small sibling pull it off for the hell of it andthrow it? Was the baby wanted? Was the sock wanted?

{"title": "Your Starting Line", "date": "Thursday, October 30, 2014", "text": "Zestful Blog Post #77Since lots of bloggers are posting today about writing, whatwith National Novel Writing Month (check it out at www.nanowrimo.org) starting on Saturday, Iwant to help you in a different way by giving you some info on writing materials,specifically paper. If you write first drafts by hand, as I do, your paper is your starting line.I think many writers are closet gearheads. We're into gearbut we're not supposed to be, because unlike painters and their materials, ourmaterials don't figure in our finished products; a writer's materials becomepointless when the story or article is published, because a new medium takes itover, so to speak.But they're NOT pointless. They have power. If you use rollerballs, ballpoints, gel tips, or pencils,your choice of paper can be based on aesthetics and price. Writing withfountain pens is another matter, as their sensitive nibs will snag on papersthat are even a little bit rough. As a rule of thumb, the cheaper the paper(that is, the higher the pulp-to-rag content), the rougher the writing surface.For years I wrote my first drafts—novels, stories, articles,everything—exclusively on yellow pads, preferably Gold Fibre brand, as thepaper is thicker, smoother, and more pleasing than the cheap pads, plus I likedthe thicker cardboard backing. They took fountain pen ink pretty well. Then I startedwriting more with rollerballs and gels, and was able to save a few bucks bybuying the cheapest spiral notebooks, as the paper quality just didn't matteras much. Then I got sick of throwing away empty pens or hunting for refillsthat cost almost as much as the pen itself. Now I write a lot with my prettylittle neon-yellow Lamy with a 1.1mm italic nib, which is pretty sensitive.I went on line and ordered a few different kinds of spiralnotebooks, to see how different ones worked with a temperamental fountain pen,and to see how pleasing they were to look at and handle. (I have no businessrelationship with any of the following companies and their products. If only.)Here's the review:National Brand Narrow Ruled Eye-Ease Paper 1 SubjectNotebook, 80 sheets, 10\" x 8\": I like the pale-green color and thenarrow rules. Most important, the paper is quite smooth. The Lamy doesn't snag.The paper, though, is pretty thin, and some inks will feather (meaning flow outa little from the line written, causing a fuzzy look), and some will bleedthrough, making it hard to use both sides. No micro-perforation, which makestearing out pages messier than one might like. Somewhat flimsy spiral wire, butdoesn't seem to be a big issue. Extra points for the matte tan cover, which mayeasily be customized with a doodle or pasted-on label. $2.99 (all prices onAmazon).Campus Wide Notebook, 70 sheets, 10\" x 7\", thecover of which sports the legend, embossed in silver, \"Campus notebookscontain the best ruled foolscap suitable for writing\". I first bought oneof these in San Francisco's Japantown, years ago, and liked it a lot. Got somenew ones, which are as good as the old ones. Excellent smooth paper, narrowruled. Resistant to bleed-out and bleed-through, which means you can write onboth sides of the paper, a practice that doubles the usable acreage. Nomicro-perforation. Excellent quality thick cover boards and double spiralbinding. Costly, but this is a top quality item. $10.99 each.Gold Fibre Retro Pad, wide rule, 70 sheets, 8-1/2\" x11-3/4\", Antique Ivory. Love the features of this one: the brown mottledcovers, the copper-look spiral binding, the buff-colored paper with brown rulerlines, the fact that the reverse sides are quarter-inch graph ruled, themicro-perforations. Apparently the quality of the paper these days is less thanbefore, which is unfortunate. I get a fair amount of feathering and bleed-throughwith fountain pen ink, and the surface isn't as smooth as I'd like. Yet I lovethe appearance of this thing, and I often tote one around if I'm going tomainly use anything other than a fountain pen with it. $5.08 each.Clairefontaine classic wirebound, 90 sheets, 8-1/2\" x11\". The emperor of notebooks, as far as I'm concerned. Excellent quality paper,smooth and thick. Takes any ink and nib, no feathering, no bleed-through, soyou can use both sides. High quality double-spiral binding, micro-perforations,and full page size make this one a joy to use. You pay for it, all right, but Ithink I'll probably always have a few of these on hand. So pleasurable to use. I've customized the one in the picture by taping a postcard of Van Gogh's 'Madame Roulin' on it. $15.42each.Do tools matter? Yes. Can good paper make you a betterwriter? No. Can it make you a happier, more productive writer? Damn straight it can.Tell us about the papers you use, hey?To post, click below where it says, 'No Comments,' or '2Comments,' or whatever.If you'd like to receive this blog automatically as anemail, look to the right, above my bio, and subscribe there.

{"title": "Story Power", "date": "Thursday, October 23, 2014", "text": "Zestful Blog Post #76When I was a teenager my mother and I went to see\"Jesus Christ Superstar\" at the local movie theater. (Given howseriously she took her Catholicism and how totally immune she was to rock &roll, I was impressed at Mom's adventurousness.) We chatted over our popcorn whilethe theater filled up. A pair of nuns in full habit came in and took seats inthe row behind us.Apart from having to explain to Mom, during the movie, thatif you didn't catch every word of \"Hosanna, hey-sanna, sanna,sanna-ho\", that was OK, the key moment for me was when Judas's hand reachesout for the bag of silver. In a soft, distressed tone, one of the nuns behindus called, \"No, Judas!\"Mom and I laughed quietly. That nun urging Judas to rejectthe blood money has stuck in my mind all these years, because it was such aperfect manifestation of the power of story. If anybody knew how this one wasgonna end, it was that nun. Yet she was so drawn in—she felt the story sodeeply—that she was moved to try to intervene.Years later I received a gag gift of a paint-by-number setof Leonardo daVinci's \"The Last Supper\". I took the gift seriously,however, completed the painting, and had it framed. It hangs in my office. (Didn't I do a nice job?) I note that Leonardomade clear to the local illiterate peasants which one is Judas, because he'sthe only one with his elbow on the table (rude sonabitch), he's holding a bag(wonder what's in it?), he's spilled the salt cellar (bad luck), and his headis lower than anyone else's (status mattered, then as now).OK, so that's four clues in one painting. If that paintingwere a contemporary novel, we'd consider it heavy-handed to put all those cluesin. It's our job as authors to avoid doing such, because our audience is evermore sophisticated. And it's a fun dance, calculating how much to let ourreaders figure out in advance.How to gauge it?Stress-free guideline #1:This will help you instantly: Always assume that your everyreader possesses a voracious, sharp intellect and loves your genre.Nobody hits it perfect, and every author makes mistakes, butdo what the best ones do, and never err in the direction of dumbing down orbroadening your hints. Why? Because keeping it smart and narrow pleases sharpreaders, and the dull ones will realize it was their fault they didn't pick upon the clues. If they love reading, they'll figure they'll have to keep a sharperlookout next time. Thus is a discerning reader born. You have a hand in it.Stress-free guideline #2:If, for instance, you're going to surprise us by revealingat the end that a good guy was really the bad guy all along, give us only oneor two hints along the way. We don't need more.Let's say you've got a hearty, beloved kindergarten teacherwho turns out to be the one who is abducting kids to be melted down for theirgrowth hormones on the international black market. Besides her talents at communicating lessons and soothing tears, you might let drop that years ago sheworked as a Border Patrol agent but got too stressed out and had to quit. (Thusshe would naturally have knowledge of at least one way to smuggle people.)That's just a little example. Now open your heartbrain and come up with more!What do you think?

{"title": "Tear Off and Enlarge", "date": "Thursday, October 16, 2014", "text": "Zestful Blog Post #75Whenever I prepare to do a writing workshop, I feel I shouldstart by having everybody meditate or relax quietly for a few minutes, to clearand make ready our minds and hearts. But I've never done it, because I knowsome people are turned off by such novelties. And I don't want to turn anybodyoff. Actually, I just now realized that I want to avoid the mild emotionalhassle of perceiving someone's rejection of the practice—the heavy sigh, themuttered comment.Wrong, I've decided. This is my show and I should runit as I see fit, and if you're with me, you're with me. Writing is art, art ismysterious, and to achieve exceptional results,you MUST tap into something beyond technique. [photo of Roy Gussow / Jose de Rivera sculpture by ES]This decision was reinforced the other day when I read aprofile of the painter Chris Ofili in the New Yorker by Calvin Tomkins. One ofOfili's art teachers, Bill Clark, had his students lie down and be with theirthoughts for a while at the start of class. That's cool, but what's even cooleris Clark's Zen-master approach of bewildering his students by assigningseemingly outrageous work, like tearing off three-quarters of a piece of work,throwing that out, then enlarging the piece that remains.Why not try this with writing—say, a short story? Slice itup, even crudely, by throwing out the first seven and a half pages of the tenyou've got—and create a whole story from what remains. Or pick the middle hunkto keep, and go from there.The point of the practice is to shake up and thus free yourheartbrain, so you can make artistic leaps and bounds that may lead you tosomething amazing.Anybody game?Now for some writing-related news.An outstanding writing coach who also happens to be myfriend, Jamie Morris, has supercharged and expanded her business.

{"title": "You Gotta Play", "date": "Wednesday, October 8, 2014", "text": "Zestful Blog Post #74Recently I was talking with a few other authors aboutinspiration. Everybody slung some bullshit about being inspired by heroicothers, and I came away dissatisfied. Thinking about it, I realized that inspirationreally means stimulation. I tried to go back in time, or basically to find someorigin or place it can all be reduced to, and TOYS kept coming up.Toys are the originalstimulators, aren't they? The original inspirers.The first toy I rememberreally loving was a fist-sized red rubber ball that came free in a Tidedetergent box. (The original Tide graphic featured a red ball in the center.)My mom fished out the ball and tossed it to me, age probably three or four. Iloved that ball. Other than its being bouncy, the main thing about it was its aroma.It smelled like Tide, and it stayed smelling like clean laundry for years,until I lost it on somebody's roof. The associations we make.My point is this:The sight or sound of atoy inspires us to act on it. A button on a string, a tricycle, an Etch-A-Sketch,a stick and an empty can, blocks, a cardboard boat. Point #2: As adults we don't stop needingtoys, and we don’t stop needing play, no matter what we try to tell ourselves.Lots of times we callthe stuff we play with 'equipment,' but it amounts to the same thing. (A golfclub by any other name, you know?)I keep trying to decideif my writing instruments, my pens and pencils and papers, are tools or toys.Well, they're both, of course.Don't spend every minuteof today doing something productive, or feeling you OUGHT to be doing somethingproductive. Play, dammit. Grab that banjo and tune it up. Run outside andpretend to be a secret agent. Sneak around. Go to the woods and find a coolstick.

{"title": "When to Push the Button", "date": "Thursday, October 2, 2014", "text": "Zestful Blog Post #73How do you know when a book is done? When is it ready towing its electronic way to agents and editors? When do you hit 'PUBLISH'?Recently I was listening to an artist discuss her currentproject, which consists of many moving parts and interfaces. Very complex. Iperceived that over time, she'd been agonizing over increasingly fine details,and was starting to have difficulty making aesthetic decisions. She didn't knowhow long it would take to make it good enough for the marketplace.Right then it dawned on me. \"You're there,\" Isaid.And I saw the exact parallel with writing projects—novels,nonfiction, stories, essays. Anything you create, really. When your project isrough, it's easy to see ways to make it better, and you busy yourself in theexecution. Then the finishing process starts to get ever more delicate; you use a finer and finer grade of grit to shape your product.When you're not sure whether that speck is a bump or a hollow, stop. Ship it.But it's not perfect!I know it! I can feel it!Good. Nothing's perfect. Moreover, nothing should be perfect. Have you heard aboutthe rug makers of Persia who deliberately weave in an errorout of fear of creating a mistake-free product? The same is attributed to Amishquilt makers, Navajo blanket weavers, Turkish shipbuilders, etc. The idea isthat only the deity can be perfect. Presumably, then, to create somethingperfect would be an affront to that deity.What a great, freeing idea for all artists! Leave perfectionto the godhead!

{"title": "Gaining Effortless Mastery", "date": "Thursday, September 18, 2014", "text": "Zestful Blog Post #71 Not long ago I watched a Saturday Night Live skit from 2008where Kristen Wiig plays the recurring character of Sue, a woman who can'tcontrol her excitement when knowing a secret. (This particular skit was theone in the Japanese steakhouse where guest star Josh Brolin tells his friendsthat he's about to propose to his girlfriend, who then shows up.)Kristen just took over, doing huge, over-the-top physicaland vocal acting, and she completely carried the skit from zero to a hundred. AndI realized that the success of that skit wasn't due to the material; it was dueto Wiig's total commitment. Nothing held back, everything tried, every stoppulled out. Body, mind, and heart. It reminded me of the great Gilda Radner's SNLperformance in \"The Judy Miller Show.\"[Sculpture by Barry Flanagan, who subverted the sober formof figurative bronze by committing to whimsy. In New York City, photo by ES.]Something else I saw recently comes to mind: an early musicvideo from the 1960s of the Animals doing \"House of the Rising Sun.\"They were a Brit band led by singer Eric Burdon. The intensity of his performance,his aspect as he sang, was jaw-dropping, way more impressive than if you simplylistened to the song. Intense, masterful. He was so young, but came across asso much older and experienced. And he sold that song like nobody's business. (TheAnimals' unusual, pulsing arrangement also helped.) Total commitment made thatsong a hit for years, and I'd say it still haunts many of our memories.Full-on commitment, and full-on confidence. Do you need theconfidence to know you can do it before you commit to doing it? Well, you cansure feel confident in your skills. But how do you exercise them? How do you findout how far you can go, how good you are, how good you can be? How do you letyour skills run to the next level and the next, how do you find the magic of effortless mastery?Simply by committing. Full-heartedly. Not stopping to evaluateand wonder, \"Is this working?\" Because if you're committed, you're confident. It's automatic. That's it. And that's magic.What do you think?

Yeah, tell me that when I'm on Chapter 3 with 29 more to go.Lao Tzu, the Chinese philosopher who wrote the Tao Te Ching,the keystone text of Taoism, said, \"A journey of a thousand miles beginswith a single step.\" Literally correct, but the much deeper meaning is that the only stepthat matters is the one you're taking right now.[Lao Tzu could no doubt translate for us, if he were here.]A much better adage for writers! It is true that the only word that matters is the oneyou're writing right now. How can it be otherwise? If you infuse every word,every sentence with your full attention—not thinking ahead, not worrying howit'll all come out—you'll create a worthwhile piece of writing. And you'llprobably have fun along the way.Embrace that paradox: Just this word, just right now. Andsee what happens.What do you think?

{"title": "Key Musts and Must-Nots for Readings", "date": "Thursday, September 4, 2014", "text": "Zestful Blog Post #69Last Thursday I wrote about how to do a successful reading,with a note on how to be a good audience member. That evening I gave a readingusing those principles, and from what I heard (attentive silence punctuated bylaughter), it went well. A flurry of folks bought You've Got a Book in You, which I briefly plugged before readingfrom my Lillian Byrd novel-in-progress, LeftField. I might add that Lynn Waddell did a marvelous job reading aprovocative chapter from her book, FringeFlorida, which also sold some copies, one of which is on Marcia's and my on-deckcircle. (www.fringeflorida.com.)I was mistaken in thinking the evening was going to berecorded, so my apologies for not having a link to share. But when it was over,I realized I have a few more bits of key advice for writers facing a reading,the first quite essential.[photo by Tiffany Razzano of Wordier Than Thou]1) Apart from doing your 'my book in a nutshell' spiel, tell your audience why your book will changetheir life. That's what somebody really wants to know before they shell outtheir twenty bucks or whatever. Samples, which feel free to adopt verbatim:\"This book will give you a new perspective on whyfamilies break down.\"\"This book will show you how to do X better / cheaper /faster.\"\"If you've ever had a burning desire to learn themeaning of life, look no further than [my title].\"2) If there's a time clock, obey it. This particular eveninghad an open-mic part, which writers / storytellers signed up for on a clipboard. The MC kepttime (ten minutes apiece), and it was uncomfortable for her and everybody elsewhen she had to interrupt a writer for time.One fellow simply stood in place and said firmly, \"I'dlike to finish.\" Well, yeah, buddy, everybody does. What was the MC to do,go up and throw him off the stage? He did in fact finish.A woman, who wheninformed that her ten minutes were up, simply stopped midstream. That wasconsiderate, but it was also awkward, as the audience wondered how her pieceended, and she had deprived herself of giving a complete show. (As to thecontrast between the two writers and how they handled the time issue, I will refrain from making the first sexist generalization that springs to mind.)Keeping to one's time limit simply requires an out-loudrehearsal at home, with according adjustments. Such practice promotes good karma.3) What about a situation where nobody has thought abouttimekeeping? Keep it brief anyway, and when you come to the end of yourselected passage, never under any circumstances ask your audience, \"ShallI go on?\"4) I wrote about this in an article WD some time ago, but itbears mention here too. I've noticed that some writers, when they come to afunny passage, will do this thing of barely suppressing laughter at thewittiness of their own material. It is shameless, manipulative, anddisrespectful. Eschew it.5) For best visibility, which matters, wear a light-colored top. I opt for cream (first choice, as in the photo), white, pale blue, or pale pink. White can tend to be too vibrant under lights, but it's better than a dark color.What do you think?

{"title": "How to Do a Good Reading, How to Survive the Audience Experience", "date": "Thursday, August 28, 2014", "text": "Zestful Blog Post #68One of the most uncomfortable hours of my life was in 1994during a meeting of Borders store managers. At that time I was regionaldirector for the West Coast, and was looking forward to seeing all my managersthere, as well as my friends in the regional ranks.The very first night after everybody got in there was acocktail reception, during which anauthor reading was scheduled. The author was Gita Mehta, noted media producerand bestselling author (also the wife of Sonny Mehta, head of Knopf), and shewas to read from her new book of stories, ARiver Sutra. It was thought that an intellectual author would appeal to themanagers, most of whom had come up through the ranks of booksellers and werehence serious readers.Horrendous idea. In spite of their interest in Gita and herbook, the managers immediately started meeting and greeting and drinking andhanging out, being in no mood to stand quietly and listen to anybody. However, Gitatook the podium and, with admirable poise, plowed through the excerpt she hadprepared. I gravitated toward one of my buddies from home offices and stoodlistening in silent solidarity, trying to form at least a pocket of politeness amidstthe din. An author more animated than Gita might have been able to hold theirown, but for her it was hopeless.Takeaway 1: Readings are not cabaret performances.Takeaway 2: Maybe they should be.Simply standing and reading for tens of minutes on end is,almost without exception, deadly. What you want to do is:1) Welcome your audience with a warm anecdote or two,something about what drove you to write your book.2) Give them a taste of your book, like 10-15 minutes of readingsome lively passage, or passages.3) Tell another anecdote or two and then take questions.Funny is good. Good anecdote material might come from how you researched yourbook, or how you got it published, etc.4) If nobody asks a question, provide your own, and / orstart asking questions of them. Like,\"Apart from me, who's your favorite author and why?\" You might learna lot.If you're in the audience, of course you'll be polite andpay attention. But everybody will love you if you come up with an interestingquestion or two. Off-the-wall is fine. Ask about the author's childhood, or ifthey've ever been arrested, or what their favorite fast food is and why.Anything. If you're a budding author, ask the questions you'd really like toknow, like, \"How did you hone your craft? How did you get an agent? Whatdo you wish you'd known at the beginning of your career?\", stuff likethat.See a demonstration of this at the Wordier Than Thou openmic tonight in Sarasota. I'll read chapter 1 of Left Field, my next Lillian Byrd novel-in-progress. The otherheadliner will be Lynn Waddell, author of FringeFlorida: Travels Among Mud Boggers, Furries, Ufologists, Nudists and OtherLovers of Unconventional Lifestyles. I've not met Lynn, but with a titlelike that, she's got to be fun.Details here:http://www.yelp.com/events/sarasota-wordier-than-thou-storytelling-and-prose-open-mic-sarasotaWhat do you think?

{"title": "Tip for Unleashing Your Voice", "date": "Thursday, August 21, 2014", "text": "Zestful Blog Post #67For a long time I thought that an original voice is asimportant to an artist as skill, but now I know it's more important. Tons of painters can render a lifelike head, butthere was only one Picasso, who tore heads apart and rebuilt them. Scores of symphonictrumpeters can play the solo at the opening of Mahler's 5th Symphonyperfectly (or damn near), but there's only one Wynton Marsalis, who interpretsTin Pan Alley tunes with the soul of a gentle genie. (Plus he can kick booty as a symphonic soloist too.)In writing it's the same, only moreso. Any English major canput together a sentence, and some write books that get terrific reviews, butthere's only one Virginia Woolf / William Shakespeare / Alice Walker / DavidSedaris / Flannery O'Connor / Gabriel Garcia Marquez / Laura Ingalls Wilder /Frank McCourt. And so on.Recently I opened my Model-T Kindle and read aloud a passagefrom a book to a group of writers eager to learn the combination to great prose. The passage was a harrowing account by anAfrican-American man, recounting boyhood beatings and other humiliations at thehands of adults who should have loved him. A mini excerpt:I struggled under you and couldn'tbreathe. The blood running down the valleys and grooves carved into my skinsmelled like one hundred wet pennies.The students were riveted by the passionately, savagely toldstory. I asked the students to guess who the author was; some guessedaward-winning famous names, but nobody got it right. It was a trick question tomake a point. The author, Leonard Scovins, is an uneducated convicted double-murdererwho's serving a life term in a Florida penitentiary.A former drug addict, Leonard found his voice in prison,thanks in part to the mother and grandmother of his victims, a womannamed Agnes Furey. After the trial of the man who murdered her daughter andgrandson, she decided the only way she could live a worthwhile life would be toforgive Leonard. Meanwhile in prison he got clean from drugs and found Jesus.She reached out to him, and they began to build a friendship. In time theywrote a book together and self-published it. It's called Wildflowers in the Median. Not exactly a grabbing title, but thenhow would one represent that story in a few words?Agnes entered the book in a Writer'sDigest magazine contest, and it won the 'inspiration' category. She alsoentered it in the 'life stories' category, which is where I came across it as afirst-round judge. In spite of the fact that Agnes's voice is a bit stiltedcompared with Leonard's, I was tremendously impressed, and chose it as thewinner in my flight of books. It didn't win the final round, but that's allright.Currently I'm reading Keith Richards's autobiography, Life, and enjoying every word. A one-sentenceexcerpt:These armies of feral,body-snatching girls began to emerge in big numbers about halfway through ourfirst UK tour, in the fall of 1963.Hilarious and informative. My point is that you don't needgreat technique to wow an audience. You need basic technique and an original, unfettered voice.The problem for many authors is how to find and let out thatvoice. My best tip for today is to read autobiographies, good ones, the bestones. See how the writers break the rules. See how they express somethingoriginally. Absorb their kaleidoscopic language. See how they cut to the chase.And take that spirit with you when you sit down to write.Got any autobiographies to recommend?

{"title": "Queer World", "date": "Thursday, August 14, 2014", "text": "Zestful Blog Post #66Last week I taught, along with the fabulous Lucy JaneBledsoe, Randall Kenan, and Eduardo C. Corral, at the Lambda LiteraryFoundation Retreat for Emerging LGBT Voices. Each of us faculty had our ownsmall group of students, or Fellows, for the whole week. My nine were writersof genre fiction. They were a brilliant bunch, full of sharp insight, talent,honesty, and generosity, and it was a pleasure to work with them. Our home wasthe campus of the American Jewish University, an oddly isolated place among thedry hills on Mulholland Drive.[The view from my seminar room.]So many things arose for me that week, both externally andinternally, that I want to explore a little bit here.I tend to be an assimilationist when it comes to beingqueer, so am usually not all that comfortable in a situation where identitypolitics is the coalescing factor. Because I'm like, hey, what's the big dealabout being different?OK, I know it's abig deal, and the level of big varies for all of us, at different times in ourlives, but I've long felt, \"Well, deal with it and get over it, and figureout the combination to the dominant culture.\"Only last week did I realize that that attitude almostcertainly comes from being the daughter and granddaughter of immigrants who, assoon as they dragged their bundles off the boat, set about learning English,getting jobs, and figuring out how to become American.One of my uncles as a teenager in the Depression scraped togethermoney to take elocution lessons, to lessen his Polish accent, believing thattalking less 'European' would help him get ahead. It did. My parents Anglicizedour last name so their children wouldn't get called 'Polack' in school. Wedidn't. (I was grateful for this many times, as when my sixth-grade teacher,Mr. Lockman, told Polack jokes in class. I sat there trying to understand whatwas funny.) I only recently learned that my father's first name got adapted atEllis Island, to Frank from Franz.So it would be natural for me to feel out of it in a groupthat exists because of differentness. I felt some of that awkward,what's-the-point-ness at the start of the Lambda retreat, but far less than Iusually do, and after a couple of days it was gone altogether. I think it mighthave been because the students had to compete to get in there, which takes courage. Too, when you're seriousenough about your art to send your work into a screening process, you tend tobe mature, which I guess is to say not stuck within yourself and your pain.I found a terrific, healthy team spirit at this retreat.Yes, there was some militancy, but even that was tempered by love.It would be easy to end this post by saying, \"Hey, in away we're all immigrants, right?\" But that's not so.

Am realizing thateven a whole week with my Fellows won't be enough to impart everything I wantthem to absorb. But we'll try!Beyond discussing writing technique and the particularrequirements of genre fiction, studying some great fiction, and doing writingassignments, I want to give them an idea of what it's like to be a professionalauthor running your own factory, including the obligations and responsibilitiesthat come with it.I'm what you'd call a mid-list author, which is publisher-speakfor 'not one of the big shots who make us most of our money'. Between signingmy first publishing contract and the time the book came out, I joked to friendsthat I was 'cherishing the last of my precious anonymity'.It's funny, though, how that anonymity gradually evaporateseven if you don't skyrocket to household-namehood. I do have a somewhat unusualsituation in that I have a dual career—novelist and writing authority—which seemsto have magnified things.A common occurrence for an author is to get a message from areader, which is almost always a fabulous thing. (Think I'll deal with the'almost' part of that in a future post.) Reader messages are fun and easy torespond to, until they hit the unmanageable threshold, which they do for therock stars. Then there's everything else. A sample daily email in-box for thelikes of me:·        Request to speak for free at a conference.·        Proofs of my latest article for Writer's Digest, requiring 48-hourturnaround.·        Note from a grateful reader of You've Got a Book in You.·        Note from an (understandably) impatient readerof my novels: \"When? When?\"·        Request for a jacket blurb from another author.·        Request for a summary of the conference sessionI blithely agreed to do for free six months ago.·        An agreement to be filled out, signed, andreturned to the conference regarding on-site book sales.·        Request for a bio and head shot for theconference program.·        Request for a one-page handout for attendees to myconference session.·        Request from an aspiring writer to read theirwork and give feedback for free.·        Request from an aspiring writer who is willingto pay for my help.·        3 junk mails from Writer's Digest, which list I have to stay on so I don't missmentions of myself that I ought to boost.·        Amazon remittance notices. (yay)·        Correspondence with the graphic artist I'vehired to make my self-pubbed covers look better.·        Request for news for the newsletter of one ofthe literary societies I maintain membership in.·        Notice that someone new has signed up for myblog.·        Notice that someone has tweeted something abouta book of mine.·        Notice of the automatic charge for maintainingmy domain name.·        Exploratory email from someone interested insomehow getting my books translated to TV.·        Email from publisher asking when I can writeanother book…Besides, of course, the photos and messages from friendsnfamily,blogs I've signed up for, and other personal and professional business.What does all this take, even if 'no' is often the answer?You got it: time.

{"title": "Beating the Challenge of Inflection", "date": "Thursday, July 24, 2014", "text": "Zestful Blog Post #63I have dialogue on the brain, having been working on,finishing, and sending in my latest article for Writer's Digest magazine, on how to write sparkling dialogue. Last weekin this blog I wrote about the difference between writing words for the stageand words for the page. Today I present another angle.When I was in my 20s I did a few voice-overs for radiocommercials in Detroit. One such job consisted of one line, and that lineconsisted of two words: \"Jones Transmission?\"The client was present during the recording session. On cueI spoke, \"Jones Transmission?\" into the microphone, striving for anupbeat tone of encouragement for the male actor who would then tell me moreabout the best place to take my ailing auto.\"No, no,\" said the client, Mr. Jones, over thestudio speaker. \"Say it like this: 'Jones Transmission?' \"\" 'Jones Transmission?' \"\"No! 'Jones Transmission?' \"\"That's what I thought I said.\"\"Try it again,\" cut in the director.\"Jones Transmission?\"\"No!\" broke in the client again, wringing hishands. \" 'Jones Transmission?' \"The director and I thought I was mimicking the client's toneand cadence exactly, but the client's ears were not so tuned. We went back andforth like that for a while, until I almost told the director to just shoot mein the head. Or the ear.I think you get the point that vocal inflection isinfinitely variable, and on top of that we evaluate the sounds we hear quitesubjectively. If a simple inflection can be heard so powerfully differently bydifferent people in the same room, no wonder music fans thought they heardanything from \"Paul is dead\" to \"Dressing on the side\" whenthey played \"Revolution No. 9\" backward.Also I hope I showed here the essential impossibility ofrepresenting inflection precisely on the page.So what's a writer to do? Simple awareness works wonders.Above, I wrote, 'striving for an upbeat tone of encouragement,' to characterizemy voice, knowing that the explication was necessary if I was to make my point.Sure, it took more words, but sometimes the words you add to dialogue are whatbring the dialogue to life. But sparingly, sparingly. Notice how you didn'tneed any more information as to how the phrase was being said, as Mr. Jones and Iwent back and forth. It works and it's funny and it's spare.BTW, I heard the ad on the radio about a month later, with adifferent actress's voice asking, \"Jones Transmission?\" It soundedjust like I had said it, but all I could do was hope the client was happy atlast.What do you think?

Isuggested a panel from an author's point of view on working with yourpublishing team, that is, how to work well with all the different people whoput their fingerprints on your book, so to speak, before it gets to themarketplace.And I was thinking how the team for getting a book to marketis so much different than any kind of team you've ever been on before.For me, I always felt part of the companies andorganizations I worked for, and it was very clear we were all on the teamtogether. To simplify, we shared a mission statement, and we all performed our rolesin the service of that. So when I became an author and got my first publishing contract,I thought I was on a new team.\"Oh contrare,\" as I once saw it spelled. I realizedthat everybody's goal is a bit different, and everybody is actually playing fordifferent stakes. And certainly as nobody's goals are exactly the same asyours, nobody's job is remotely thesame as yours. In fact, you're more like a solo acrobat than a power forward.Your agent and agency represent you and work for you in someways, but they have their own bottom line.Same with your publisher. Sure, everybody wants to put outgreat books that sell well. But those folks work together every day at the sameplace, they have their own group dynamics, their own pecking order, egos,etcetera, and you are not really part of that. Moreover, unless you're a bigshot (meaning an author to whom they've just paid a huge advance), they don'tparticularly have an incentive to make you happy, because you're not theircustomer, either. Book merchants are their customers: bookstores, onlineretailers, etc.You are a supplier to your publisher. You sell them rawmaterial, and they run it through their machinery so that they, in turn, can sella finished product. Actually, I suppose, it's more like they license materialfrom you, because then they pay you a percentage of sales. (Royalties.)So it's a vastly different business dynamic than many of usare used to, whether we come from the world of business, or academe, or evenpublic service.To make it all work to your advantage, you simply must tryto understand where every single person on that team is coming from, and figureout ways to help them. Then they'remore likely to want to help you. A backbone of steel is a plus, too.  Post a comment now! What do you think?

{"title": "Cultural Currency for Writers", "date": "Thursday, July 3, 2014", "text": "One of my professors in university kept a coterie of devotedstudents around him, who sucked up to him for approval and grades. If you wereone of \"Jerry's Kids\", you could count on him for support.The rest of us scorned the whole business. The term\"Jerry's Kids\" was a cruel reference to the actor and humanitarianJerry Lewis and the children afflicted by muscular dystrophy and similar diseaseswhom he'd been helping for decades. The implication was that the professor'sfavorite students couldn't make it on their own, but needed the equally needyprofessor to coddle them along. When I mentioned something about \"Jerry's Kids\" toanother professor, she looked at me blankly. English was not her firstlanguage, she hadn't grown up watching the Muscular Dystrophy Telethon, thusshe had no idea what I was talking about. I shamefacedly explained it, and shegot it, but the moment was not jovial.Authors often use common cultural references to get a pointacross, and it seems more and more, as our culture changes, expands anddiversifies, the odds of somebody \"not getting it\" keeps going up. Asauthors, I guess we should bear this in mind, but slang and idioms can add juiceto our narratives. (From the Latin idioma,meaning peculiarity in language or phrasing.) I like old ones, like\"getting ridden out of town on a rail,\" \"deadpan,\" and\"shoo-in\".[Irrelevant photo of old-time train by ES]It's funny how these get misinterpreted. I once readsomething by an inexperienced writer that went, \"He got ridden out of townon a rail, but he'd helped lay the track.\" Having read Mark Twain's of The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn, I knew what it meant to get ridden out of townon a rail, and it has nothing to do with trains. (It was a horrifying punishmentfrom colonial times, where the victim, with bound hands, was forced to straddlea fence rail (painful at the least, most fences being made of narrow woodenrails or poles) and be carried in humiliation through town and dumped on itsoutskirts, often after being doused with tar and feathers for good measure.)The expression currently means something like \"cast out in shame\".\"Deadpan\" is another one whose origins lie farback. In 1920s America, pan was slang for face. Remember Ernest Hemingway'sshort story \"The Battler\"? The old fighter notices Nick looking athim and asks, \"Don't you like my pan?\" If you looked at somebody witha dead pan, you were giving nothing away by your expression. I also like\"shoo-in\", which I've seen misspelled as \"shoe-in\". Thephrase originally meant a horse that's set to win a rigged race. When you shoosomething, you sort of wave it on. These days you might use it when talkingabout a political candidate who's running unopposed or against tokenopposition.A good copy editor—that is, one with a vast personalstorehouse of linguistic experience, is worth his or her weight in gold to anauthor. They catch stuff that would embarrass you if it got through into print. How to train yourself to be a copy editor?

{"title": "The Value of Bad", "date": "Thursday, June 26, 2014", "text": "When I worked as a store manager for Borders back in themid-90s I was called on to help write, and then host a customer-servicetraining video. The idea was to show booksellers how to help customers in avariety of scenarios, some of them difficult, and to \"give them thewords\" to handle things successfully.Giving people the words is of immeasurable help. Have you everdiscussed—with a trusted friend or associate—a difficult situation you're aboutto face, and that person puts just the right spin on it, and you found yourselfsaying, \"Oh, thanks! That's just what I'll say.\" I sure have.So I was delighted to help write the script. Having managedpeople for years, and witnessed some terrible choices and behavior along withthe good (and been the one to clean up the mess afterward), I made sure to include a common scenario where the bookseller saysand does the wrong things. Then Iwrote a scene where the bookseller does it right. My reason for putting in anegative example was so that front-line staff would understand that certainwords and actions a) are in fact rude; and b) never achieve the result youwant. When you're standing in front of a mirror, it's hard to be in denialabout what you see.But the human resources dept. manager, upon reviewing the script,cut the negative example. I believe the HR people had the fear that showing anegative example would somehow encourage negative behavior, which made no senseto me. But I was certain the scene would prompt nervous laughter and giveemployees insight they couldn't get otherwise. I lobbied my case, but lost thatone. We shot the video, and it was a good one, but it could have been better,funnier, and more effective.These days when I write articles or teach workshops on howto write well,I include negative examples where appropriate. Simplysaying, \"Do it this way,\" is of limited value unless you show howcrappy a result you get if you do it thatway. The meta thing is that a student doesn't necessarily know which elementsof \"doing it the right way\" are the important ones. I always remember,as a young reader, consuming Dan Keyes's innovative novel Flowers for Algernon and being struck by the scene where thementally impaired Charlie Gordon is told to watch a baker make rolls so he canthen do it. Watching, he has no idea if the position of the baker's elbows ashe rolls the dough is as important as the recipe itself, or what. He cannotgeneralize or differentiate at all. He needs more context.If you let students examine a suboptimal example, thenpresent a worthy one, you have provided a huge amount of context, and theirunderstanding and ability to translate the material to their own experiencegoes up by a factor of at least three. (Where did that math come from, you ask?Just trust me.)I've been thinking about this while putting together areading list for an upcoming novel-writing workshop. There is no perfect novel,no flawless novel out there (because of course art is subjective in the firstplace). Being able to point out and discuss the negatives in anacknowledged masterwork is freeing and instructive, and it's just a bunch offun too.[Postscript: I just Googled Dan Keyes and found he died a few days ago. RIP to somebody who gave a wonderful gift of art to this world.]What works for you as a learner?

{"title": "Don't Stop at Orange", "date": "Thursday, June 19, 2014", "text": "Achieving an effect: that's art. A writer has to think aboutthis stuff just like a painter, for instance. If a painter wants to paint a moltenorange sunset, you bet she's going to focus on that orange. Naturally. Abeginning painter would simply open a tube of orange paint and slather it on ina circle. A painter who has really taught herself to see, will start with abase of perhaps white, then add yellows and reds and maybe some brown, blue, orgreen. Since if you really look at anything, even a molten sun, it's not allone completely even color.A real example: One of Vincent Van Gogh's self-portraits. The picture looks lively, vivid, real, honest. Yet if you lookclosely,there are streaks of green paint in his beard. (You can see it better in the original in person; this is just to give you the idea.) Well, hisbeard hairs might have been a mix of reddish, brown, and maybe even a littlegray. But green? Why does the picture look so great? Maybe because Van Goghlooked at the world with fine attention. He saw that light reflects off of justabout every surface, and colors change as the light changes. Shadows aren'tblack; they're blue, brown, olive. (Note on copyright: I took this photo of apage in a book. Because the photo is an image I created, I own the copyright.If I captured an image of a Van Gogh painting from the Web, that image might becopyrighted by somebody else. So basically: If you take a photo, it's yourproperty, and no trouble ought to come of your sharing it.)The observer of that finished painting doesn't go, \"Hm, Ithink the artist began with a base of umber wash; no, maybe a dull white—andthen he added the umber, some yellow, then maybe some vermilion, and maybe—do Isee a trace of ultramarine?\" No. Unless the observer too is a student ofart, or a passionate artist who sees and understands art technique, they'rejust going to go, \"Man, that is one intense, energetic picture.\" Andthey have a feeling that the artist gave it everything he had.When a good writer sets out to represent a character or asetting or a story, they take the trouble to conjure it mentally, first, asclearly as possible. Then they look, listen, smell, taste, and feel deeper,then they go about writing. This takes time. But the result is writing thatfeels more alive on the page than the reality that might meet the reader whenthey look up from that page. And that is known as a tour de force.Post a comment now.

{"title": "Exploitation and How to Use It", "date": "Thursday, June 12, 2014", "text": "Exploitation is a term few novice writers really understand.Simply, to exploit is to use, whether fairly or unfairly. Most people attach anegative connotation to the word because it makes them think of strip-miningand migrant workers toiling hard for little pay. But it's the same word wemight use in a sentence like this:The native peoples discovered the island and began toexploit its natural resources: wood, fruit, and mollusks.Exploit comes from the Latin root explicare, meaning to unfold. I love that.A storyteller can exploit his audience cheaply or withintegrity. Makers of the so-called 'blaxploitation' films of the 1970s figuredthere was a latent desire in urban black audiences to see white bigots andauthority figures humiliated by strong black characters, and they sought to servethat up. The supermarket tabloids exploit their readers' dual appetites forscandal and seeing photos of celebrities looking fat or old. Those are examplesof cheap exploitation. But you'll note that they are also examples of extremelycommercially successful exploitation.Countless novels exploit their readers:Eugene Burdick and Harvey Wheeler's Fail-Safe (fear of nuclear war);Michael Crichton's TheAndromeda Strain (fear of alien germs);Erich Segal's Love Story(desire for a soul-mate)…and I realize I could go on and on, from adventure tales tomysteries to literary works. Think of all the ink!If you pick up a good novel and read it while keeping, inthe back of your mind, the question of exploitation, you'll learn a lot about howto push an audience's buttons. Literary works often exploit the reader's intellectualismand sense of wit. Thrillers exploit the common human desire to be on thesidelines when something big and violent is happening, then to witness it all comeclear and peaceful in the end.Thinking about all this, I realize that exploitation in literatureis simply a way to connect with your readers.Cheap exploitation that traffics in stereotypes getspredictable and tiresome fast. But if you take care to really get inside yourreader's head and treat what you find there with respect—and a bit of mischief—youcan go a long way. You can invent characters who are not stereotypical, who areas complex as real people, whether dumb or smart, and you can put them intosituations they react to with thought and purpose. You can turn a stereotypeinside-out and see what you find there. You can offer your reader a meal of instantporridge, which will satisfy hunger, or you can prepare a gourmet feast thatmust be savored to fully appreciate, which satisfies much more than hunger. The key is knowing that everybody's hungry for something.You can be zany or serious during all this. Just accept thefact that you, the writer, are the boss, and readers want to you be in charge. Give them something they're expecting,then give them something they'd never dream of, then slap them around a little,then kiss them goodnight. They'll love you.Post your reaction to this piece now.

{"title": "Win or Lose, What to Make of It", "date": "Thursday, June 5, 2014", "text": "A few friends of mine returned from the writing-prize awardsceremony (brand name is irrelevant) \"sans bling\", as one put it. Andthe most pragmatic thing I can say is this:It's better to have deserved to win and not won, than tohave won and not deserved it.I am not the first to make that observation. I've been ajudge in three national writing competitions, and my work has won a couple ofawards. Notice I don't say I won a couple of awards; I say my work won. This isan important distinction: You are not being judged, your work is. \"But mywork is me!\" No, it's not. This is essential to remember not only whendealing with awards, but when reading reviews. My God, I've had professionalreviewers make completely opposite judgments about my work, and if I took itseriously EITHER WAY, I'd be impossible to live with.Needless to say, if your work didn't win, you're lucky ifyou feel that a work genuinely superior to yours won. But when it comes towriting championships,well, they're like figure-skating competitions. A panel(usually) of judges decides who gets the bling, because the whole business issubjective. There's no finish line to cross first or ticket sales from openingweekend to measure, though at least in figure skating it's obvious whether you landed that triple or fell on your ass. For writing, it's worse. While any judge can tell whether you can writecomplete, coherent sentences, one judge might love your style, while another totallydoesn't get it. Worse still, a judge might have something against youpersonally and not have the integrity to recuse himself or herself. Judgesdisagree, judges quarrel, judges have their pet vanities, judges havesentimental ideas about who SHOULD be the winner this time, judges vote, andthe majority rules.If your work has won, it gives you the freedom andcredibility to say, \"It's all crap!\" if you really think so.I might add that I recently dug out of storage one of myawards, in the form of a chunk of acrylic with a medallion embedded in it. Islipped it from its protective velveteen sleeve and found that the acrylic hadgone all cloudy and yucky-looking. No one's fault, just a reminder that awardscome and go, and it's only the work that endures.[photo of ES's desk cup by ES]To post your ideas / comments, which I want to read, clickbelow where it says, 'No Comments,' or '2 Comments,' or whatever.If you'd like to receive this blog automatically as an email,look to the right, above my bio, and subscribe there.

{"title": "Savoring Great Style", "date": "Thursday, May 29, 2014", "text": "I'm a sucker for lots of things—a well made martini,acceleration, Chopin's polonaises, wool socks, and courage in the face ofhumiliation, to name a few.But my utmost passion is for great style in writing. Style,like quality, cannot come out of haste, and it can't come out of exploitation.(I think I'll write about exploitation next week.)Great style comes from:1) Brains;2) Generosity; and3) An unsentimentally artistic heart.I've been rereading some favorite books in preparation for aworkshop I'll be doing later this year (the Lambda retreat) and have beenfeeling just joyous while slowly devouring them, making notes and savoring thestyle.Two such books are pictured,along with some scribbles and a breakfast bowl of veggiesand quinoa. (Yeah, I hold back on the martinis until Friday nights…) Plus apage-a-day calendar I use as a book prop and thus don't turn the pages asregularly as some tight-panted fanatic would. Plus I see a crumpled receipt andan outdoor thermometer that just got a new battery and needs to be stuck on thewindow again. Plus my old silver Parker ballpoint, fitted with a gel cartridge. (FYI: The ink in those is totally water-soluble. My massage therapist accidentally left a check I'd written her with that pen in her pants pocket, which went through the wash, and the check came out completely intact, and completely blank. I reused it the next time I saw her.)How to define great style, how to communicate it? To me, greatstyle defines itself as a passage that serves more than one purpose. That's ablunt definition, and imperfect, but here are a few examples from those bookson the table in front of me.From page 1 of Dashiell Hammett's The Maltese Falcon:She finished shutting the door behind her, leaned againstit, and said, \"There's a girl wants to see you. Her name's Wonderly.\"In general, Hammett's prose is pretty workmanlike, and somepassages in this book are even pedestrian, but he knows what he's doing. Thatpassage tells us three things:1) Spade's secretary knows enough to keep a barrier betweenthe stranger in the outer office and Spade in the inner;2) Her diction is working-class, leading us to guess she'sstreet-smart enough to serve her boss well—under a variety of conditions; andof course the obvious,3) Spade has a possible new client.That simple passage embodies economy and style in just aboutequal measure.Still prettier is this one, the first sentence of Chapter10:Beginning day had reduced night to a thin smokiness whenSpade sat up.We learn that Spade is still in bed, and from the lastsentence of the prior chapter we know exactly with whom, and we learn a new wayto visualize dawn breaking over San Francisco.If Patricia Highsmith's ghost were to enter this room, Iwould bow down before it.From Chapter 1 of TheTalented Mr. Ripley:Maybe Richard was in some kind of jam. Maybe Mr. Greenleafwanted help, or advice. Tom knew just what to say to a father like Mr.Greenleaf.Very simple words, but the key is the last of the threesentences. We learn that Tom feels in control of the situation ('Tom knew justwhat to say'), and we learn that he's able—or feels capable of—sizing up astranger based on a very few clues ('to a father like Mr. Greenleaf.'). Basedon this, we might also conclude that Tom has a fairly high opinion of himself,and that he is perhaps a rather cunning young man.One more, from Chapter 4:Tom's friend Cleo, upon hearing that he's being dispatchedto Europe to bring back Dickie Greenleaf, exclaims,\"How too, too marvellous!It's just like out of Shakespeare or something!\"That's just what Tom thought, too. That was just what he hadneeded someone to say.We learn that Tom, in spite of all his inner bravado, isdeeply insecure. And we see something of his shallowness. A subtle way to showus! Highsmith doesn't write, \"Tom was an insecure, shallow young man.\"She lets the character reveal himself to us little by little.This was going to be a super-short post, but I could write a wholebook on just this one thing. Great style is something casual readers miss. Toget the full experience of terrific fiction, you have to read with as muchpatience and trust as the author has invested in the writing.

Because I knew no one there, I felt a sense of newness andfreedom. I must have blossomed somehow and become more outgoing and interesting,because one night after lights out in my 12-girl cabin, one girl said,\"Elizabeth, tell us the story of your life.\"#1: It's fun.On the spur of that moment, lying on my back and talkinginto the dark, I began telling my new friends about my early childhood in Iceland,including many convincing details such as the local species of ant that builtlarge hills on the plains us children had to cross every day to get to school.#2: It gets you into a creative state.In winter, I recounted, the hills froze hard, and if youdidn't watch out, you'd fall over them, which I frequently did. (That got a sympatheticlaugh.)['The view from my bedroom window in Iceland.' photo by ES]#3: It entertains and challenges your listeners.I don't remember a tenth of the stuff I made up that andsubsequent nights, but it enchanted my camp-mates, at least until one of thefaster girls started talking about sex. I never did reveal that I'd lived inMichigan my whole life; I wonder if any of those girls remember my crazy tales.#4: It's good exercise for your storytelling muscles.Since then I've done countless similar things, most recentlyexplaining to a roomful of patients at the physical therapy office that my armwas in a sling because it had gotten torn off in a terrible car wreck, but thedoctors had reattached it in a grueling 17-hour operation. (In reality I'd had outpatientarthroscopic shoulder surgery.)#5: It's a test of guts.The thing is, I never just volunteer such information; Iwait until somebody asks or gives me a wide opening.

But it seems that bloggers who write in depth about personalthings connect better with their readers. It also seems that bloggers who arewilling to make enemies do well at connecting, because you can be provocativeby being critical of someone else or someone else's ideas, you can start alittle war, you can try to get your Twitter followers to gang up on theirTwitter followers…[These kids are zestfully blowing their own horns.

{"title": "A Dragon, an Arm, and a Hammer", "date": "Thursday, May 8, 2014", "text": "I've received a few requests to bring you up to date on myattempts to use the voice-control software Dragon Naturally Speaking, which many authors writewith whether able-bodied or not.Last winter I bought a copy of Dragon when I was havingtrouble with my dominant arm, possibly facing shoulder surgery with a longperiod of immobility during recovery. Seemed like a prudent thing to do. Iblogged about my orientation and early uses of it, and I felt good about havingDragon as an option to help me write with a bum wing. Doing the whole pre-use protocol,where you read sample passages into your microphone so the software can get asense of your accent and cadences, was a big help in accuracy.Moreover, though, I was very much into the possibility ofusing the software as a regular way to get words down on the page (or thescreen). Think of the ease, think of the sheer volume you could achieve!I feel like a crouton, but I just haven't taken to it. It'sa great program, and I have a feeling I'll give it another concerted try soon,but I just feel more comfortable with my old system of writing longhand, thentyping it into a Word document, editing and rewriting as I go. I get suchpleasure from putting words on the page using real pen and paper. Good oldtools.As it turns out, all alternative therapies for theshoulder—physical therapy, acupuncture, deep-tissue massage, even herbalsupplements and this new-agey thing called biopuncture—have failed to make any improvement.

{"title": "Elusive, Vital Standards", "date": "Thursday, May 1, 2014", "text": "When I was a student at Michigan State University I took apoetry-writing course from Diane Wakoski, who was considered one of the hot, avant-gardepoets in America. I was impressed by her strong feminist philosophy, which isprobably best summed up by the title of her collection from 1973, Dancing on the Grave of a Son of a Bitch.The students wrote poetry and she did critiques, and inclass we discussed both student poetry and professional poetry (that termsounds so weird). One of the students was a guy who tried to make his stanzasrhyme, but he wasn't very good at it. Besides, rhyming poetry was so nineteenth-century.One day this student stood up and read a new poem, which indicatedthat he realized not everybody thought his poetry was good, but he thought it was good, and that's whatmattered.[This is a great portrait.][Right?]Ms Wakoski was a quiet, tolerant woman, but evidently shehad reached the end of her rope. She sighed, then quietly but clearly said,\"This is what people who don't read poetry think poetry is like.\"There was just like this thud in the room. The student hadno reply, and I'm not sure he even realized the size of the cannonball that hadjust been fired into him.I sat there stunned at Ms Wakoski's frankness, especiallybecause the student was the only African-American in the class. I'd haveexpected her to go easy on him, in the spirit of affirmative action, or white-liberalguilt, or whatever you might call it.That moment has stuck with me, as I'm frequently called onto critique the work of aspiring writers. Ms Wakoski's comment to that studentwas not constructive. It was dismissive. It was honest.Telling the truth is important, but we can only tell thetruth as we see it. And there, right there, we see the little shadow ofrelativism. If not everybody can agree on uniform standards of quality in art,does that mean all artistic products are equally good?It does not.While we can strive to give criticism constructively, allartists are, or should be, definers and defenders of standards. Admittedly it'san impossible task, and we can disagree on what those standards are, but by Godwe must know our own standards, and by double-God we must first and foremosthold ourselves firmly to them. Hopefully, as we grow and mature, our artisticstandards get ever more refined.In this dumbed-down world, is there anything more important?[Image note: The Mona Lisa by ES]Tell us what you think!

{"title": "Pistorius Trial Imitating Art?", "date": "Wednesday, April 23, 2014", "text": "The other day I was intrigued by a news item about the SouthAfrican athlete Oscar Pistorius, who is currently on trial for the shootingdeath of his girlfriend Reeva Steenkamp. A South African journalist publishedthe allegation that Pistorius had secretly received, before his trial began, actinglessons from a close friend. News (and gossip) sites are trying to confirm orbust the story. According to behaviorists who claim to know these things,Pistorius's natural personality would make him react with anger and hostilityto stuff going on at the trial, so if he could get himself to appear sad anddistraught instead, the judge might go easier on him. If you've looked in onany of the news about the trial, you know that Pistorius wept and retched afair amount of the time.I don't know enough about the story to have an opinion, but I'mkeeping my eye on it, because my novel TheActress is based on exactly such a premise: Unsympathetic defendant getssecret acting lessons, in hopes of influencing the jury.I remember when the idea came. I was sitting on the couchwith my beloved partner Marcia, watching a true-crime program about a woman whohad been on trial (in the U.S.) for the murder of her young son. I don't knowwhether she did it or not, but she was convicted. Several of the jurors wereinterviewed later, and they said things like: \"I don't know, I just didn'tlike the way she was. She didn't seem sorry that her son was dead. She justdidn't act how you'd expect.\" None of them said anything about theevidence; it was all about the affect of the accused.Marcia and I were appalled. Holy crap, was that all it tookto get convicted? We started to think about the opposite: Is that all it wouldtake to get off?Marcia said, \"You should write a novel about a murderdefendant who gets acting lessons during the trial.\"I was like, \"Yeah!\"This was years after O.J. Simpson's acquittal for the murderof his ex-wife and her boyfriend, which to some people seemed based on eitherO.J.'s star power or feelings of payback for the Rodney King case rather thanthe facts. (Here again, I don't know whether he did it or not.)The point is, I started looking into the fickleness ofjuries. It's enough to turn your blood into ice tea. One of the theoreticaladvantages of jury trials is that it's supposed to be harder to bribe, fool, orintimidate 12 people instead of one judge. Maybe, maybe not.I developed a mystery story based on thesecret-acting-lessons idea and wrote the novel. It was good enough to get merepresentation and a two-book hardcover deal with a major publisher (St.Martin's Minotaur / Macmillan). But when my agent tried to get a Britishpublisher interested in the UK rights, they said things like, \"It's a weebit too high-concept for us.\" Which is publisher-speak for outlandish,implausible. No, thanks, they said.And here we are with today's headlines. Different?Outlandish? Implausible? You be the judge.[Photo of reflection of Los Angeles by ES]Tell us what you think!

{"title": "Cutting to the Chase", "date": "Thursday, April 17, 2014", "text": "In the last few days, for various reasons, I've been readinga fair amount of unpublished fiction by aspiring writers. I'm happy when eitherof two things jumps out at me: When an author cuts to the chase, and when theyexpress something with unique style.What do I mean, cut to the chase?Simply, get to the point.There's not just one finish line in a novel, there are athousand of them. Whenever a character talks, whenever the momentum shifts,whenever the world changes—a rainstorm comes up, an engine coughs and catches,someone feels a surge of love or hate—there's a chase. Cut to it withoutanything extraneous. The best writers cut to their chases free from fear andeager to let it flow.Another happy time is when I'm reading a Pulitzer-winningbook or the humblest pages from a hopeful writer, and I come across uniqueexpression. Probably happier than when I realize a great plot is unfurling.Both together? I fall on the floor.Savvy readers instantly recognize terrific style: The wordsdon't just swing, they surprise. You've never thought of dawn light as 'siftingover the land', but when a character does, you go 'Ah.' And you're richer forit. You'd never think to describe somebody's eyes as 'seeds', but when you readit, you experience a tiny burst of pleasure. You've just been helped to see.The way to write like that is to unleash yourself. Forgetany rule about words you ever knew. Go deep, then go deeper on your thousandchases. Your finished words must flow swiftly and smoothly, but you must never hurry.How do you cut to the chase? How do you excavate your inner stylist?

{"title": "Bones of Mysteries and Thrillers", "date": "Thursday, April 10, 2014", "text": "One of the most popular presentations I give is \"How toWrite a Dynamite Mystery or Thriller that SELLS.\" I initially wrote it as a webinarfor Writer's Digest, then I adapted it for in-person presentations andworkshops, and then I included some of the material in You've Got a Book in You. I'll be givingthe presentation in two places this summer, the Golden Crown Literary Societyconference in Portland in July and the Florida Heritage Book Festival Writers Conference in St.Augustine in September.Today's blog is to give you one of the nuggets of thatpresentation.When I started out writing fiction seriously, I made a pointto read stuff on how to write great fiction or at least fiction that doesn't suck,like writing magazines and interviews of famous authors. And I remember havinganxiety about whether my stories were mysteries or thrillers. Why? Because somany writing authorities, including editors and agents, were shouting that you have to write one or the other, and theforms are very different, and youmust follow the correct form, or yourmanuscript will be shoved into the feed box of the monsters that live in thetunnels below Manhattan, because editors and agents require precise categorizationof the novels they traffic in, and they have like zero patience.[Risking my own neck, I captured this image of one of the Manhattan tunnel monsters on a trip to New York recently, so I could prove to you they exist. As you can see, one hand is a catcher's mitt and the other is a Garden Weasel. Terrifying.]The thing was, every authority's definition of mystery andthriller was different! The formulas seemed complicated, dogmatic, andhopelessly impossible to follow exactly. Anyway, what kind of writer would wantto?It took me a long time to figure out the single basicdifference between the two forms:A mystery is a puzzle.A thriller is a pursuit.You just went, \"Yeah!\", right? Because somehow youknew that already, and it totally fits.To be sure, most mysteries and thrillers contain somepuzzling stuff, plus some getting-chased-by-the-bad-guys stuff. But it'susually more of one than the other, and so there's your category.Currently, it seems agents and editors (not to mentionreaders) aren't as hung up on dueling definitions, but they still like tocategorize books for the sake of promo and marketing, which is important.But most important of all is a good story.Tell us what you think!

If her manuscript wasn'tgetting actively rejected, it was languishing in slush piles all over town. AsOlivia told it, she was broke and divorced, buying groceries on credit. Yo,bummer.One night, however, she got a phone call out of nowhere froma young man who had been trolling through one such slush pile. He'd been struckby the manuscript's originality (the revenge of middle-aged wives who've beenleft for new hotties) and he thought it would make a terrific movie. He'd takenthe initiative to pitch the story to filmmakers in Los Angeles, several of whom,he told Olivia, were interested in buying the rights.Instinctively, Olivia asked which one would pay her the mostmoney.\"Probably Sherry Lansing at Paramount,\" came theanswer.\"That's who I want to talk to,\" said Olivia.So the rights got bought and buzz started building. Then andonly then did Olivia hear from—guess who???? Major New York publisher aftermajor New York publisher who \"remembered that they really liked it!\"And somehow, gosh darn it, her manuscript had fallen through some ridiculouscrack! And would she be interested in talking it over during lunch today at theFour Seasons?I admire her for not choosing one of the publishers who'drejected the book in the first round, but a smaller, less-known imprint (Poseidon Press, div. of Simon & Schuster). The book became a bestseller (1992), andthe movie got made (1996). It was a hit, too.Olivia enjoyed the high life, hobnobbing around New York andLos Angeles, going to the spa, even getting the occasional nip and tuck fromthe plastic surgeon.And she kept writing, twelve books in all. Her novels weren't asmash with the critics, but who cares? She was a big-time personality, a NewYork Times bestselling author. She had made it.One day in 2004 she climbed onto the operating table to geta little work done on that pesky chin fat. Something went wrong during theanesthetic phase, and Olivia, age 54, never woke up. She was taken off lifesupport after eight days.When I saw the news item about her premature death, I thought,\"Wow. I've spent time envying that woman, and now look. If she could,she'd envy me, because I can at leastbreathe and walk around.\"Beware your own definition of success. The Buddha would tellyou you've already made it. Enjoy every minute.[photo of Times Square by ES]Tell us what you think!

{"title": "Generous Writing: What is it?", "date": "Thursday, March 27, 2014", "text": "Occasionally you'll read a book review that says an author was'generous'. What does that mean, exactly?Authors can certainly be generous with their subjects. Forinstance, when you portray a brutish character as also having a sensitive side,that might be called generous. Writing fully fleshed-out characters is also, ofcourse, the mark of a mature author.But what critics really mean when they praise a work offiction—or an author—with the term 'generous' is that the author gives us morethan he or she has to.An example makes this crystal clear. Here's a possiblecharacter description:He was a pale guy, not just ordinarily pale, but reallyextremely pale.Now read:There Jerome hung, skinny, sunken-chested, as white as asaltine, his face scrunched up and one hand clutching his nuts. (JeffreyEugenides, Middlesex)or:There warn't no color in his face, where his face showed; itwas white; not like another man's white, but a white to make a body sick, awhite to make a man's flesh crawl—a tree-toad white, a fish-belly white. (MarkTwain, The Adventures of HuckleberryFinn.)You read it, you see it in your mind's eye, you enjoy it,you appreciate it. If you read with fine attention, you're grateful that thewriter cared enough to give you something more.Dull writers cannot be generous; the creativity just isn'tthere. But if you have any spark of talent at all, and the desire to get good,you can challenge yourself to come up with original ways to describecharacters, places, even ideas. How? By taking the time to be there fully with your characters and your scenes. Open yourheartbrain and let the world pour in. Take notice, and take risks.If you do, you'll have a good chance of being the kind of writerreaders love without knowing why, the kind of writer savvy reviewers call'generous'.[Photo of Marjorie Kinnan Rawlings's desk at Cross Creek, Florida by ES.]Tell us what you think!

{"title": "More Now-Ness", "date": "Thursday, March 20, 2014", "text": "Does your pet help you to write? As the Shaggs sang,\"There are many things I wonder,\" and today that's one of them.Prompted by Vicky H., a writer, blogger, and reader of You've Got a Book in You, who tweeted the photo below. Alsoprompted by Eckhart Tolle, who mentions in one of his books that he's livedwith a few Zen masters, all of them cats.[Photo by Vicky H. Also check out Vicky's blog, www.sleepinginanunmadebed.com.]In spite of the fact that the protagonist of my Lillian Byrdnovels is a pet owner (or keeper, or whatever the current PC term is), I'veowned only a few half-assed pets in my day: two sequential parakeets, severalsequential turtles, some tropical fish, a chameleon, and gosh, that's it. Oh,plus one time my dad caught a tiny toad in a jar and gave it to me. I had noidea how to care for it, so when it appeared sickly, I let it go in the backyard and told myself it would build a little hut of grass and live happily everafter. But no mammals, other than the mice and bats that lived in past houses.I guess mammals you strive to kill can't count as pets.I'm told cats like to get extremely up close and personal when you write. Sure, they want attention. But the fact that they're so in the moment (as is,really, every nonhuman animal) must be a boon to a writer, mustn't it? Here's apresence that isn't blocked about anything, isn't worrying about the carinsurance bill, doesn't care who wins March Madness (whatever that is), won'twaste money on Lotto tickets, and can't fear THE END approaching. Plus beingwarm and furry. How can that now-ness not transfer to you, the writer, somehow?Same with dogs, really. They're louder than cats and that'sabout it, as far as I can tell.We could all use more now-ness, right? Because it helps the flow.On to today's stream of consciousness: Writing itself helps freeyour mind. When I started this post and mentioned the Shaggs, I had a burst ofinsight, which I put aside until now. It's about the intake of culture. There'sso much culture out there vying foryour attention, from everything on the web to the magazine rack at thebookstore to ads on the sides of buses. OK, yes, there's so much. There's aton. There's a billion tons. And I think some of us worry about how to sort anddigest it, knowing that you're never going to get all the stuff you probablyshould get. And my insight is this: Bits and pieces really do work.To understand outsider art, for instance, simply look into theShaggs. (I was introduced to them by Susan Orlean's 1999 piece \"Meet theShaggs\" in the New Yorker.) You don't need Attwenger or Bill Traylor orPlan 9. Well, you do, but you've got to live your life too. You've got to dowhat all great outsiders have done: They didn't ingest outsider art, theymade their own.Tell us what you think!

I witnessed this conversation between the storemanager, Tim, and the slightly hard-of-hearing employee who shelved the horrorsection:Tim: \"Jan, do we have any more It?\"Jan: \"What?\"Tim (louder): \"It!\"Jan: \"What?\"Tim (still louder): \"Stephen King's It!\"Jan: \"Oh! Well, a lot of people think so.\"To be sure, these many years later, a lot of people still dothink so. Stephen King, that's a guy with a long, prolific career. (An enviablebank account, too, no doubt, though we're only supposed to care about the art…)Stephen was so prolific because he did a lot of writing.Given that writing takes time, and that the number of hours in a day is finiteat 24, it recently occurred to me that Stephen must have said 'No' to lots ofstuff that wasn't writing.And I thought, yeah, man, I gotta say no to more stuff thatisn't writing, given that I want to be remembered as an author.Let this orange pen inspire us all to write and read more!The photo was sent to me by Lidy W., who follows my blog.

{"title": "The Romance of Tools", "date": "Thursday, March 6, 2014", "text": "I've had questions 'off-blog' about the group of writinginstruments in Zestful Writing's heading picture. From left:1) A Fisher Space 'bullet' pen, perfect for pocket, purse,or wetsuit. Developed for the US space program, it writes reliably under any conditions.I believe because the cartridge is under slight pressure, the ink tends to forma blob at the end of the ballpoint between uses.2) A blue gel pen, either SARSA brand or Pilot brand, can'tremember which. I like these for travel, and as backups when my fountain penruns dry when out and about. SARSA is the smoothest I've found.3) Lamy Safari Vista fountain pen, medium nib. Cheap (c.$30) but good. I like being able to see the ink level in the reservoir. I gotthis pen for writing in cafés after, lost in the fog of chapter 10 or 12 or 39,I made the nearly fatal mistake of leaving my prized Mont Blanc (not pictured) onthe table when I went to the bathroom. When I returned I saw the guy at thenext table staring at it steadily. I could read his face with ease: I want it. Should I? What if I did?4) One of my best pens is this Parker Duofold in pearl andblack. I bought this one in San Francisco when I left my day job to be awriter. The feel of the thing is wonderful: the material of the barrel is warmand remarkably smooth in your hand, and the gold nib glides across papersmoother than anything. In retrospect, this one's a bit gaudy, but it deliverseverything it promises.5) Faber-Castell TK Fine Vario, 0.7mm. I love pencils,especially mechanical pencils, ever since my big sister showed me hers as shedid her awesomely complicated-looking high-school math homework. The barrel was translucentred, as I remember, and I thought it was the coolest thing in the world. A fewyears ago she mentioned that her current favorite was the TK Vario, so I boughtone. I find the polished steel grip a bit slippery, but I like the looks of thepencil so much that I reach for it all the time. I like the cushioning spring(mine's set to soft) and I like the exposed, twist-advance eraser.6) Staedtler Mars-Lumograph wood pencil, 3B. From my drawingkit. The leads in these are incredibly smooth and beautifully bold and dark.7) Staedtler white plastic eraser—the best.8) Brass barrel sharpener stamped 'West Germany'. Sharpens great and feels so heavy and perfectly machined that you want to keepit in your pocket at all times.What are your favorite writing tools?[photo by ES]To post your ideas / comments, all of which I read and tryto respond to, click below where it says, 'No Comments,' or '2 Comments,' orwhatever.If you'd like to receive this blog automatically as an email,look to the right, above my bio, and subscribe there.

{"title": "Memory Serves", "date": "Thursday, February 27, 2014", "text": "As a child I was an early riser. I'd get up at dawn and roamsilently around the house. One morning I picked up a sheet of paper my mom,then a college student, had left on a table. On it were typed the strangest wordsI'd ever seen. They formed a poem, and I read the paper over and over, fascinatedby the screwy vocabulary. I was eight.One night at dinner I began saying the poem from memory, forthe hell of it, and everybody put down their forks and looked at me. I finishedthe poem with the repeated first stanza, \" 'Twas brillig, and the slithytoves did gyre and gimble in the wabe...\" Nobody commented, but yearslater I later learned I'd made some kind of impression. To this day I canrecite the whole of \"Jabberwocky\" (Lewis Carroll), though I can't say it's ever comein handy.Later, one of my college professors awarded us extra creditfor memorizing passages of classic poems. I memorized stanzas from Milton,Keats, even Chaucer and them kinds of guys. The one that's gotten the most playin my life is from Coleridge's \"Rime of the Ancient Mariner\", wherehe talks of the bloody sun and the shrinking boards and you just can't find adecent drink of water anywhere.You can hold a room spellbound with thatpassage, if you get into it. Just in case, here it is (from Part II):All in a hot and copper sky,The bloody Sun, at noon,Right up above the mast did stand,No bigger than the Moon.Day after day, day after day,We stuck, nor breath nor motion;As idle as a painted shipUpon a painted ocean.Water, water, every where,And all the boards did shrink;Water, water, every where,Nor any drop to drink.The very deep did rot: O Christ!That ever this should be!Yea, slimy things did crawl with legsUpon the slimy sea.About, about, in reel and routThe death-fires danced at night;The water, like a witch's oils,Burnt green, and blue and white.Have you memorized poetry? If so, what? Do you ever findyourself declaiming it?[Photo by ES.

Not necessarily, anyway. Matter of taste andpersonal preference must be considered.A restaurant offers many different dishes. If a dish new toyou was placed before you and you tasted it and didn't care for it, I hope youwouldn't say it was bad food, unlessit was poorly prepared. And there are some empirical standards by which wejudge food: ice cream should be cold, a steak should be sizzling, a pilafshould offer some complexity as well as a pleasing blend of flavors, thereshouldn't be a dead fly in anything, and so on.(I might add that little chickens should be nicely browned.)Same with writing. You rightly expect to find livelycharacters, an engrossing story line, and some measure of style, for starters. Ifyou read something that contains mistakes of grammar, implausible plotting, andbland dialogue, then you're justified to call that writing bad, and canlegitimately post a negative review on your favorite online forum.What if you like adventure tales, but you pick up a bookthat turns out to be chick lit? Not to your taste, not your preference. Are youjustified in calling it bad, and warning others away from it? No, not merely onthat basis.In fiction as in anything, defensible standards can be goodguidance. We only cause damage when we assume our taste should be everybody'staste.[Photo of nicely browned little chickens by ES. Little chickens nicely browned by MB.] What do you think?

There's right brainfor blowing bubbles in a meadow, there's left brain for doing your tax return,there's the place that's supposed to control your urge to kill, the place thatmakes you know when to double down on a pair of fours in blackjack, and theplace that comes to life when you hear a champagne cork pop.I just love that popping sound, not necessarily because itmeans something good to drink; I just like the sound. I like the rhythm of trainwheels, too, and the buzz of the beans in the coffee grinder. I play the drumsin a couple of symphony orchestras here in Florida (Tampa Bay Symphony and theSouth Shore Symphony Orchestra, both of which have concerts upcoming), and Iguess that means the percussion zone of my brain has crowded out other, moreuseful zones, like the one about doubling down.A clarinet was in the closet at home when I was ten, so Istarted on that. But I soon yearned to play the drums. Expressing a desire tochange instruments, however, would have shown weakness of mind. Also, GirlsDidn't Play Drums, and the ones who did had to endure constant questions as towhether they really were a girl or not. If you were a true girl, you played theflute or clarinet.In college marching band I played saxophone but made friendswith burnout drummers and, when the season was over, became one of them. Undertheir pot-smoke-impregnated wings, I learned that halfhearted drum playingearns you a spot in the toilet of public opinion, while playing drums withconcern and heart earns you nothing. But while you're doing it, you feel likeyou're on the summit of Everest.And that's the key: to go into any arena and look for thething that inspires you most.Playing percussion, I learned you don't just hit it; youplay with taste, you listen to the ensemble, and you acknowledge your place inthe back row as coolest of the cool.A trumpet player once said to me, \"You must have nervesof steel to play the cymbals.\" And it's true. You know the old saying,\"If you're going to make a mistake, make a big one\"? Well, you getyour chance if you're on cymbals. Unlike the violin, where you can look at nineother people playing the same thing and go, \"Oh, yeah, I'm lost right now,but I'll come in when they do,\" there's nobody else poised to strike thosetwo heavy spun brass plates, whether fortissimo or quad-piano.

{"title": "When is Progress Not Progress?", "date": "Thursday, February 6, 2014", "text": "When the Interstate highway system went into place, bit bybit, it was exhilarating. I remember the construction of new pieces of it in myhome state of Michigan. Suddenly you could drive safely on the Interstates at aconsistent speed, and get to where you're going as efficiently as possible, giventhe interdependent elements of time and fuel use.Thus the old, slower routes were superseded. Progress wasmade.Right?Sure, in a way. Interstates made, for instance, the old U.S.Route 66 obsolete, as least as far as Chicago to Los Angeles was concerned. EventuallyRoute 66 was decertified.[Thanks to Tom Vegod for cool photo of Rte. 66 clock.]Yet the Route retained its status as the original road toCalifornia, and now it's being revived by buffs of history and romance.Why?Because, of course, faster and more efficient isn't alwaysbest. And lots of people know it. But fast and efficient are so seductive!I think about these things when reading and writing.When I was in my twenties I learned how to speed-read(remember Evelyn Wood?). Speed-reading was progress: A new technique to helppeople like presidents and researchers absorb the gist of a book in a fewminutes. But for me it was like taking one bite out of a delicious dish of foodprepared with care by an expert chef, swallowing it without chewing, thenthrowing the plate away, then grabbing another dish, taking one bite, thenthrowing the rest away, etc.I thought reading slowly must be what stupid, lazy peopledo. Yet I liked to read slowly, and I still do. It took me years to get comfortablewith that, to stop feeling ashamed of being a slow reader. Ridiculous, I know.But now I say it loud and proud: When you read slowly youcan take pleasure in the author's style. You can pause to think things over.You don't miss stuff. Because for me, a single beautiful, perfect sentence canbe the most important thing I remember about a book, fact or fiction. Plus, Ireread some books, for the pleasure and learning of it.Scanning some informational stuff for its gist is OK, forsure. I do that.I know I won't read as many books in my lifetime as fastreaders do. But I'm OK with that.As for writing, I like to write at a pretty good clip. But Islow down when I need to.

{"title": "Got Author Picture?", "date": "Thursday, January 30, 2014", "text": "When I speak or do writing workshops, I often use PowerPointslides with pictures as well as bullet points. I almost always put in one of mycurrent head shots, and as a side piece of advice I'll say, \"Get a goodauthor picture taken.\"Authors who create a head shot by cropping themselves from asnapshot, or get their kid to shoot one, almost always get a result that screams,\"Cheapskate amateur!\"You'll use your head shot not just on the jacket of any bookyou write, but for your web site, social media pages, promo for readings andother gigs, etc. You want one that makes you look professional, thereforeyou need professional help. [Photo by Thomas Bender.]Take my advice:1) Look into local photographers. Check out their work, askquestions. For my most recent shots, I chose a friend who's a professional newsphotographer.2) Pick a day well in advance, and book the photographer forjust after lunchtime.3) Book a hair appointment and a makeup appointment for thatmorning. I asked my makeup artist for a natural look, and after about an hourof intense effort, he achieved it. Guys too should consider a professionalmakeup job, to even out their skin tones.4) For girls, buy a tube of the same lipstick your makeupartist uses, so you can refresh your lips after drinking or eating. For guys, unlessyour artist puts lip color on you, use Chap Stick or such to keep your lipsfrom looking dry.My photographer came to my house with portable lights andreflectors. We tried different settings—dining-room table, chair in the livingroom, outdoors. The key to being a good subject is to relax. At times I triedto conjure feelings of amusement, love, and enthusiasm, and that seemed towork.What to wear? Simple is best. Remember your picture might beviewed in a small online format, so gorpy stuff won't scan. Light colors helpbring out your face and your hair color. A dark shirt or top can, when viewedin a thumbnail on line, just look like a dark blob or shadow.Today's digital photography is a godsend compared to oldentimes, when you pretty much had to sit for a studio portrait. The guy wouldtake six exposures, and you'd look stiff in all of them. You'd pick theleast-horrible one and live with it.A good photographer today will make dozens, if not hundreds,of exposures, shooting rapidly at times to capture the nuances of theirsubject's fleeting expressions. I'm not naturally photogenic, so it was great to havehundreds of shots to choose from. I tell audiences that of the 400 shots thephotographer took, in 396 of them I look like Norman Bates's mother. Alwaysgood for a laugh. But we caught lightning in a bottle a few times. My agent,upon seeing the shots I chose, exclaimed, \"You actually look warm andprofessional!\"Tell us what you think!

Sure, some critics dismissthe poem as middle-brow corn, but not me. I admire stoicism and generosity ofspirit, and the poem celebrates those things. But the real meaning of the lines,\"If you can meet with Triumph and Disaster / And treat those two impostorsjust the same\" eluded me. Who the hell could ever equate triumph anddisaster? Must be some metaphor in there that I'm missing.When I learned that those two lines are inscribed above theplayers' entrance to Centre Court at Wimbledon, I thought, there must be moreto it than I think.It was only after I studied Zen and other spiritual textsthat I realized those lines of the poem are meant to be taken literally.Everything changes; everything passes. Therefore everything is the same;therefore everything is sublime.It's a great lesson for writers, who tend to live and die bythe opinions of others. You know:Good review = happinessBad review = despairSame holds for remarks from writing-group buddies. Sameholds for rejection by an agent or an editor.The more you write, the more material you put out there, themore you hear from critics.

Busy, that is, expandingtheir creativity and learning just how painless it is to find good storymaterial.I picked up coffee and a paper on my way to the conference,then spent a half hour skimming through it and making notes. I'd never donethis before, and was happy to find how ridiculously easy it was to come up withprompts.BTW, a writing prompt is simply a little story opening orscenario, to use as a jumping-off place for a writing session. The point is,you don't have to fight to write.In the spirit of turning swords into ploughshares, I rippedout a few pieces of dispassionate news and turned them into compelling promptsusing my stormwriting cues of 'Yes, and—' and 'What if?'There was an article in the sports pages about a localskating pair who was competing at the U.S. Olympic trials. What if, I thought,they're a married couple, and what if the man is having an affair with theircoach? Yes, and just as they're about to take the ice, he asks for a divorce.(So yes, coming up with writing prompts is a creative endeavor in and ofitself.)That was the first scenario I prompted my little group ofwriters with, suggesting they too use 'Yes, and—' and 'What if?' to take itaway. When it came time to share aloud (never mandatory) I was amazed at howvaried their ideas were.One wrote a scene where it turns out both skaters were having an affair with the coach; one wrote arinkside scene in which the woman was totally relieved that this jerk isfinally asking for a divorce; another constructed a quick skate-blade murderafter the competition.A classified ad for a lost camera provided fodder foranother exercise: What if you find it? What if you look at the pictures on it? Yes, and then you have to decide what to do about it. Ready, go.Every page of that paper contained stories and ideas forstories. The real lesson? Any writer can use the news. Simply:1) Look2) Look deeper3) Identify a possible tangent4) Write it!Can you think of a writing prompt based on a current headline?Have you ever come across a particularly memorable prompt?Tell us.

{"title": "5 Great Things About Being a Writer in Florida", "date": "Thursday, January 9, 2014", "text": "#5:  You can write outdoors year-round. Sure, it's hot in thesummer, but all you really need is a tank top and some shade. An iced beveragehelps, but is not essential.  #4:  For various good reasons, Florida attracts vastly more than itsdemographic share of criminals, degenerates, and trashy imbeciles. Thus youneed go no further than the radio, newspapers, and billboards to find terrific story fodder.#3:  Florida levies no state income tax, useful for when youbecome a multi-millionaire from your writing.#2:  Beta-testing your writing aloud is easy in Florida. Drive inany direction for five minutes and you will encounter an assisted-livingfacility. Walk in, find the rec room, and start reading. You will have anattentive audience. If you actually do get feedback, it'll be honest.#1:  The state has wonderful groups and organizations forwriters, especially the Florida Writers Association. The first time I went tothe annual FWA conference I was a presenter—and a stranger. Afterward, I hadnew friends. Most of all, I was impressed by thewe-are-all-cheerleaders-for-one-another spirit I found there.Tomorrow and Saturday I'll be presenting at FWA'smini-conference in Bradenton, as will other experienced workshoppers fromaround the state. Gobs of aspiring writers will be there! If you stop by, I betyou'll make friends too.[Photo of lonely beach by ES]Tell me what you think!

{"title": "Training My Dragon", "date": "Thursday, January 2, 2014", "text": "I'm dictating this post using the voice recognition softwareDragon Naturally Speaking. I ordered this software when I started having problems with a shoulderthat was preventing me from writing and typing easily. Prior to this I wasusing the voice recognition software that came with my Windows package on mylaptop. The Windows software had a hard time understanding my speech; itgarbled words and missed punctuation marks, and I found I had to go back and makeway too many corrections for the exercise to be worthwhile.Dragon is definitely a superior product. I ordered it, bythe way, on Amazon for under $50. The main thing I found amazing is a featurewhereby during setup, it will scan your document files and pick up unique wordsand phrases and constructions that you personally use. It's as if it's checkingyour idiosyncrasies and incorporating them into its own little brain. This is extremelyuseful. For instance, I'm writing a novel that features a character with thefirst name of Shirlene. The first time I used that name in dictation, Dragongot it right, including capitalization, having read it during its initial scan ofthe novel's master file.I might add that I'm using my USB microphone headset insteadof the jack-type one that came in the box, having seen reviews where this isrecommended.It certainly takes getting used to and can feel very awkwardat first. There's a tutorial that helps you, of course. I find myself, whileusing Dragon, dictating and then correcting by hand as I go, learning moresophisticated commands along the way, and that will lessen my dependency onhand correction over time. My need for corrections is much less than with theWindows program. (Right here, another for instance, Dragon automatically capitalizedWindows, sensing my 'commercial' use of it.) I find myself most annoyed byDragon's lack of ability to understand when I want to use a contraction, suchas 'I'm'. OK, I just dictated that word, I'm, again, and it got it right. Ienunciated it a little bit better that time. I also just tried over-enunciatingthe word and it turned it into \"I aim\". The voice commands for usingthe edit functions and moving the cursor are quite user-friendly.The real challenge for me is the very act of dictation. I'mamazed at how different the experience is from writing longhand or typing. There'sa whole different neural pathway from your brain to your mouth than from yourbrain to your hands. I sort of knew that already, and have been looking forwardto this experience. I've found that one huge key is to not look at the screenwhile I'm dictating, because the words appear on the screen with some measureof delay. When I look away from the screen while talking, as right now, my thoughtsseem to flow much more easily.I think I'll get best results if I do a whole bunch ofdictation, as in whole pages, then go back and do corrections later. Correctingas I go is a flow-killer. This is definitely the kind of thing where repeated,constant practice yields great rewards.So, thumbs-up on Dragon. I intend to make another post aboutall this after I've gotten more comfortable with the software and used it fordictating large amounts of new material; in my case that's going to be mostlyfiction.[Photo of Dragon Gate, Chinatown, San Francisco by ES.]Tell me what you think!

In light of that, what would a goodChristmas/Hanukkah/Kwanzaa/Druid gift be?Besides the obvious (a copy of You've Got a Book in You; a new pen), the best gift you can give awriter is time. Yeah, baby! Of course time cannot be given any more than healthcan, but opportunity for uninterrupted time devoted to a single task can be. Howabout an hour a day of quiet time with no resentment attached? Or a couple ofdays—better still, a week—at a motel in another town where intense work couldget done? Or a course in time management.I've always dreamed of getting passage on a transoceanicfreighter where I could get the better part of a book done. In the middle ofthe Pacific, you can't hear your cell phone…. And there are no excuses.If you give the gift of time to a writer, watch theirreaction. Unbridled joy? Dread? If it's dread, so much the more reason forhaving given the gift.Come to think of it, time is a gift that reveals more aboutthe recipient than the giver, isn't it?May your holiday season be filled with good cheer, love, andplenty of ink.[Photo by ES]Tell me what you think!

{"title": "Your Ideas Are Your Capital", "date": "Thursday, December 12, 2013", "text": "The other day I was listening to an aspiring writer tell meabout the novel he's writing. He mentioned that he had ideas for furthernovels, but was unsure whether to spend the effort developing them before hesaw whether agents / editors / readers would be interested in this first book.He asked what I thought.I told him that in my own case, ideas have broken throughfor me before a finished work did. Although I sold my first four novels to a publishermyself, it wasn't a novel that got me representation. Hungry for a biggeraudience, I set out to write a novel good enough to score me a hardcovercontract with a big house. I wrote the novel and shopped it around to agents. Oneread it and called me up. \"You're obviously a terrific writer,\" shesaid, \"but I just don't think I can sell this book. What other ideas doyou have?\" I told her a few, and she asked me to develop them a littlemore on paper. I did so, and she got back to me saying, \"I really likethis one about the actress. If you can write that one, I think I can sellit.\" Which is what happened, and TheActress debuted in hardcover with Minotaur Books (MacMillan). I've beenwith Cameron McClure at the Donald Maass Agency ever since.The same thing happened the first time I approached Writer's Digest magazine. I wrote up adetailed inquiry about an article I'd like to write for them, and decided atthe last minute to throw in a few other ideas at the bottom, just in case. Theeditor got back to me and said in a nice way that my main idea sucked, butthey'd like me to write an article based on one of the little ones in the lastparagraph. So I did, and have written more than 30 feature articles for them todate.Which, I realized, exactly parallels something I learned inHollywood. A few years ago I flew to Los Angeles to meet with a televisionexecutive to discuss making my first mystery series, the Lillian Byrd books,into a cable TV series. Over a meal at a hip restaurant in West Hollywood (Ifelt existentially enviable) we talked about my books in detail, how the seriesmight be structured, and even threw around casting ideas.Then the executive asked if I'd be willing to be a writerfor the show.\"Sure,\" I said, \"but I thought you guysusually just bought the material and had other people write the scripts.\"She said, \"You don't understand. It's not so much thatwe want this material you've written. We want your talent; we want YOU.\"\"Oh,\" I said.She explained, \"You were thinking about how the movieswork. The movies want a script. TV wants a writer.\"As it turned out, the executive couldn't get the big shotson board with the project. But thinking about all that later, I realized thatpublishing is like television production: agents, editors, and readers don'twant a book, they want an author. They want somebody who can writegreat, compelling book after great, compelling book. They want an idea machine.So there you have it, aspiring authors. Write up all of yourbest ideas and have them in your back pocket. Get started on that next novel!Come the time to start putting your first baby out into the world, your newerstuff just might be instrumental in your breakthrough.Special notes for this week:Local friends, check out the Florida Writer's Association BradentonMini-Conference in January, just in time for that New Year's writingresolution: http://www.floridawriters.net/FWA_Upcoming_Events.htmlI'll be there doing a workshop and a writing-promptssession. Check out the other faculty; some pretty accomplished people will bethere, all with the goal of helping you.I guarantee you'll deepen your talent and have fun doing it.And to follow up on last weeks' post: I've received mypackage of Dragon software and will set it up soon.

{"title": "An Arm to Stand On", "date": "Thursday, December 5, 2013", "text": "When you're a writer you tend to take your physical abilityto write for granted. It's shocking when that skill becomes compromised.Earlier this year I caught a finger in a steel door. Thewound was small yet impressively gory, and because of it my ability to writewith a pen and type was impaired for a few days.That got me to remembering an episode in Ernest Hemingway'slife, when he broke his arm in a car accident in Montana in 1930. It was hisdominant arm, and they had to operate (using kangaroo tendons to bind thepieces of bone together!), and it took many weeks to heal. With the armimmobilized, he couldn't write with any ease—longhand with his left waspractically impossible, and typing one-handed was cumbersome, slow, anddistracting—and he became depressed. At that time of his life, that was unlike him.I've thought about all this quite a bit more lately,experiencing some disability in my dominant arm. Sparing you the fascinating,innumerable details, I have a complete tear in the shoulder cartilage thatholds my arm on, plus a bunch of  inflammation.My chiropractor, viewing the dramatic MRI, assured me I needsurgery, and I spent weeks reading stuff on line and living in growing fear ofthe months-long process of post-surgical immobilization and rehabilitation. I madelists of things to do pre-surgery (buy pull-up pants, replace batteries insmoke detectors, go to the hair salon, finish all Christmas prep) and worriedsome more.But when I got in to see the surgeon, he gave me a reprieve:with drugs and therapy, I might regain an acceptable level of function withouthaving an operation that cannot be guaranteed to succeed anyway.By a stroke of luck and faith, I hooked up with a wizardphysical therapist who has worked behind the scenes with elite athletes andordinary joes, rehabbing grievous injuries and restoring amazing function.We've just begun, and I'm encouraged. Am typing this with both hands!But I did go ahead and order some voice-recognition software(Dragon). Because even though I'm able to write normally for the moment, Irealized the great truth of being able-bodied: You never know. Moreover, I've wondered what it would be like to write withmy vocal cords, so to speak. I'll give it a try.Which feeds into the issue of productivity. These days,given the multitude of demands on authors' time, what with social media,self-promo, and all that bullshit, authors are increasingly concerned withproductivity in the time they DO allocate for actual writing. And it's a giventhat the bigger your backlist is, the better your sales, the better your income.Obviously we can talk faster than we can write—so is that the future ofcomposition?Output alone won't cut it, of course. Yet on the other hand,it does, for many writers. Some put out hurried, half-done crap just for thesake of getting another title out there.This will be an interesting trip.Tell me what you think!

{"title": "Solo Thanksgiving Essential", "date": "Thursday, November 28, 2013", "text": "I have an important piece of advice for you if you shouldever find yourself planning a Thanksgiving alone. It involves multiplication.Years ago when I took a temporary management position in anotherstate, I realized I would have the opportunity to be alone in my Residence Innsuite on Thanksgiving.In the two times I've taken the Myers-Briggs personality sorter,I've tested once as introvert, and once as extrovert. Somehow I feel introvertis slightly more accurate, but it's not like I'm one of those people who don'tknow how to shoot the breeze with a bartender. But it was wonderful tocontemplate a whole, low-key day alone in a quiet world, especially as I'd beenworking like a stevedore with scores of stressed-out retail employees.I thought the classic thing would be to watch football on TV(my hometown team, the Detroit Lions, always play on Thanksgiving) and eat aturkey TV dinner.So I made sure to stop at the store Wednesday after work, scoreda Swanson's and a six-pack, and felt totally set. The next day I bowed my headin silent tribute to the Pilgrims and the Indians and remembered drawing handturkeys in kindergarten. Come meal-time, I got out the Swanson's and popped itin the oven.Here was the thing: It wasn't enough to eat. I'm noheavyweight, but when I took the thing out of the oven and settled in front ofthe tube, I was like, hey, what kind of Malibu Stacy meal is this? Belatedly Irealized the portions were damn skimpy compared with a regular home Thanksgivingdinner. I fished the box out of the trash and looked at the nutritioninformation: only 330 calories. That, I figured, was about a fourth of what Iwould normally eat on Thanksgiving.Tragically, the grocery store was closed, so I was forced tosupplement my feast with a stale package of Lorna Doones from the cupboard.Hence my Thanksgiving tip: If you're goingsolo, buy two or three Swanson's. And some fresh cookies. With enough beer,you'll be fine.Tell me what you think!

{"title": "How to Go Deep", "date": "Thursday, November 21, 2013", "text": "Somewhere inside every writer dwells a mystic.Yet we live in deconstructionist times. Seems like there's a precise formula for accomplishment in everything, guaranteed by somemarketplace-dwelling 'guru'.Good writing? Writing success? Is there a difference? Yes.If you want to deepen your understanding of writing, if youwant to explore your passion for writing, talk to people who are devoted to thepractice of a demanding thing. I emphasize devoted.Think about what that means. Ask, Why doyou do it? A true devotee will give you one answer: I do it for the sake of the thing itself. A yogi practices yoga forits own sake. A painter paints for its own sake. A nun practices her religionfor its own sake. A race-car driver races for its own sake.A true devotee asks nothing from that which he is devotedto. As a devotee you give yourself to the glory of something much bigger andmore important than yourself, at whatever the cost to you. And you do it withgladness. And you are rewarded. You may not be rewarded in the way you expector want. The point is, if you practice this thing with your whole heart,without greed and without vanity, you will transform your life.[Image note: E's drawings]Tell me what you think!

{"title": "Unconditional Love is a Harsh Mistress", "date": "Thursday, November 14, 2013", "text": "Somehow, I'm the kind of person people like to pour outtheir troubles to. I don't think I look particularly sympathetic, but maybethey get the vibe that I can help. Whenever someone talks to me aboutrelationship problems, I fall back on something I learned long ago:Unconditional love isa harsh mistress. But it's the only one worth serving.This is the only piece of advice I ever give, and it's notreally advice. It's a credo.Credos provide perspective and a steady compass needle. Ithink because we live in a time of easy gratification and moralrelativism, self-indulgence is easy to rationalize. Without a solid credo ortwo, we fall prey to laziness.Writers, real, true writers, those whose veins runwith Quink Permanent Blue-Black or Namiki Wild Chestnut, consider writing to betheir mistress. And sometimes she is harsh!When you write seriously, with passion, whether you are aprofessional or aspiring to be one, you have gotten to the point where you mustlove your mistress unconditionally, or you will be tempted to compromise. Youwill be tempted to give weight to little setbacks and misunderstandings thatdon't matter. You will be tempted to quit, not knowing that in the very act ofpersistence lies salvation.So: Join me in loving our beautiful, infuriating, sexy,impossible mistress unconditionally. Serve her without question, and see whathappens.[Photo by ES: Original drafts of You've Got a Book in You.]Tell me what you think!

{"title": "Long Table Requiem", "date": "Thursday, November 7, 2013", "text": "One morning about six months ago I was writing in one of mygarrets, a Starbucks in Bradenton, Florida, sitting at one end of the longtable there.I always thought of that table as the Mad Tea Party—big enoughfor six, therefore you often found yourself sharing it with strangers. Some ofmy favorite long table regulars were a frumpy-looking couple who would bring ina plastic shopping bag from which they'd dump a cloth chessboard and pieces,plus two timers. After getting their drinks they'd play one or two intensegames, saying little to each other, then pack up and leave.But on this day I shared the table with a fortyish woman whoworked intently on her laptop doing some kind of video editing. Then we were silentlyjoined by an older woman who sat with her cappuccino, doing nothing, looking atnothing. She seemed to be going through the motions of having coffee at a café,and her vibe was sad and unsettled.So when she got up to go, I made a point of looking up andsaying in a friendly way, \"You have a good day now.\"She looked at me and blurted, \"My husband killed himselfthree weeks ago. I don't know how good today's going to be.\"What could I do but get up and give her a hug? We stoodtalking for a few minutes. She told me her husband had run up debts for years,the extent of which she was still discovering. It appeared she would lose herhouse, which was also her place of business, she being an artist with herstudio at home. I consoled her as best I could, even giving her my phonenumber if she wanted to talk.When I saw her next at the café she thanked me for the hugand the concern. We've kept up as café buddies. One day recently she told me,smiling, \"All this has forced me into the here and now. I have no ideawhat's going to happen next. And I'm perfectly at peace.\"I have a few other café buddies, all of whom I met at thelong table, and some day I'll have to tell you about them.A month or so ago the Starbucks got redone, with new paint,different pictures on the walls, and new furniture. The long table is gone,swapped out for some nice leather chairs and smaller, low tables that studentsput their feet on.I started this blog entry thinking my subject would be my cafébuddies, but I realized as I went that it's really about the long table.I miss it.[Photo by ES]Tell me what you think!

You know, trials andtribulations! Once you conquer all those dreadful obstacles life puts in yourway, you can finally approach your true potential, right?At some point it dawned on my that I had identified myselfas a struggler. That was my story: I'm aperson who has to struggle along and hope for breakthroughs.Even though all the greatest teachers—spiritual andotherwise—try like hell to make us understand that all obstacles are self-imposed, it took me some time to start to believe it.And then I understood that we become the stories we tell aboutourselves.These days I choose struggle only when I'm out of synch. Assoon as I come to my senses,I quit struggling and remember the peace and zest that arealways within.In You've Got a Bookin You, I wrote this sentence:If it's not fun, makeit fun.But to take it a step further:If you can't make itfun, decide that it's fun.Now that's radical. If you've been telling yourself writingis hard and life is unfair, try another way. Take these sentences from mycurrent story and make them your own:I'm a confident,poised person. Nothing bothers me. I'm a highly talented writer, and I have funproducing beautiful, zestful work every day.Writing your own story is a wonderful thing to do. If you don't like your current story, write a new one.

{"title": "The Lounge Not Taken", "date": "Thursday, October 17, 2013", "text": "I've barely shaken the road dust off from the Writer'sDigest conference in Los Angeles (plus workshop in Hollywood sponsored by mybuds at Kleis TV) and I'm zooming around packing for this weekend's FloridaWriter's Association conference in Orlando.There are few things more boring to read than somebody'spostmortem of a conference, unless it's somebody's thinly-veiled promo aboutgetting ready to speak at a conference. The thing is, all conferences wanttheir speakers to shamelessly, tirelessly, and relentlessly flog the conferencefor months in advance, using every possible orifice of social media, andafterward try to make people regretful if they didn't go, because it was somuch FUN, so that hopefully they won't miss it next time.Oh, baby. As I used to say to the able-bodied panhandlers inSan Francisco, \"No can do.\" (Eventually I was driven to say,\"Get off your ass.\")As a veteran author and conference presenter, one wouldthink there is no rope I don't know. However, even I learn things, every time.And they're never what I expect to learn.I think my best insight from Los Angeles happened in thehotel bar.So this is the Century Plaza, which is the kind of hotel youalways hope they'll put you up in. (Thank you, WD!) (In spite of numerouspleading telegrams from my agent, the hotel is paying me nothing to write nicethings about it in this popular blog.) And there's this luxurious big cocktail loungein the lobby, smack in the middle of everything. You have to pass by it to getfrom the main doors to the reception desk, then pass it again to get to thecorrect elevator.And the night we get in, the bar is packed and noisy. I seewell-known faces I'm supposed to walk up to and greet—\"Oh, hi, so good tosee you again, oh yeah, my thing's at 3 tomorrow, when's yours, oh yeah, howcool, you and I are just so cool and having so much fun!\"—which isactually the last thing I want to do. I skillfully avoid them and explore, andfind that there's a huge part of the bar outside, beyond some glass doors. Aplace that's quiet, dark, and dramatic, with stone decking and columns ofwarming flames shooting up in the chilly night air, and servers right handy tobring you a martini and some restorative bar food.Why isn't anybody out here, instead of cramming up indoors?That question hovered in the back of my mind for days before the answer burst upon me:The hotel bar is a place to be seen.If you're someone who might possibly be recognized, perfect;otherwise you're hanging out nearbypeople who might be recognized, and a little of that sparkle somehow floatsover on you. Moreover, this is Los Angeles, nexus of see-and-be-seen culture.You need the relatively brightly lit lobby bar for maximum exposure andego-gratification.If that appeals to you, that's the strategy.No? Then join me wherever it's quiet and off the beatenpath.[Photo note: The many balconies of the Century Plaza, shot by ES.]Tell me what you think!

{"title": "What to Leave Behind?", "date": "Thursday, October 10, 2013", "text": "A wise old author once said, \"Only by giving yourselfpermission to write poorly will you write anything at all.\"Oh, wait a minute, that was me. Haha. It's on page 11 of You've Got a Book in You. I do hope toget old someday (better than the alternative), and I am an author. Wise? Somereaders say so, but time—and more readers!—will have the most to say aboutthat.I just noticed that sentence is the most-highlighted one byreaders of the Kindle version. This struck me, because it really is my mostimportant message, and in a way it's the whole book in one nugget. If we letfly on the page without caring beforehand about the results, we free ourselvesto discover things we didn't know were in us. Wonderful, good, magical stuff.Readers have gotten in touch to say how much the book meansto them, and a few of them have even attached pictures. This one is from CordiaPearson, an accomplished writer and businesswoman:As she said in her message, \"Anointed, highlighted,starred, and most of all, used.\" I love it. Thank you, Cordia!I hope You've Got aBook in You will be a significant part of my legacy as an author andperson. That makes me happy. And it makes me want to do more.I'm thinking about these things—what one leavesbehind—because an elderly family member died recently. Here is a picture ofAlice T. Doyle, who passed at age 91:As the picture suggests, Alice was one of the first flight attendantsin American aviation. Her legacy is more than that, however; in spite of being supremely crabby at times, she was a goodfriend to many people, and she dedicated much of her later life to taking careof my uncle and aunt (her sister) during their final years. She also did herpart to support the bourbon industry, as well as keep alive the vocabulary usedby Naval personnel during WWII.She's not a blood relative, but to me she was anhonorary member of the family.The lesson? Since we can take nothing with us, might as wellleave behind as much as possible. Whatever we can give, we give.As for writers? More gifts lie within you. Do like I do, andgive yourself permission to write poorly. But do write! And see what happens.Pour it out now, and devil take the hindmost!Tell me what you think.

{"title": "Small Will Get You to Big", "date": "Thursday, October 3, 2013", "text": "[I initially wrote this post for a Writer's Digest blog last spring, and I've heard so many nice things about it that I decided to publish it on my own darn blog.]I'm coming to feel that aside from young children, therereally is no such thing as a beginning writer. Practically everybody has somewriting experience! Making the transition from 'beginner' to 'writer' is simplya matter of finishing a writing project, whether a short story, essay, article,or book.What does it take to finish something worthwhile?Two ingredients:1) Zest.2) A focus on the small.Zest is what you have when you feel strongly about your subject,or when you feel excited about the act of writing. I'm working with a fellowwho is writing his first novel, set in the world of international sport. Eventhough he's not very experienced, his writing is exceptional because he's sopassionate about his subject. He is determined to get his novel finished andstart sending it out. Zest is his fuel.A writer without zest will not write much of anything good.You just can't. But that's all right! You can simply write, dammit, zest or no,and by writing—just by sticking with it, keeping your pen moving or yourfingers going on the keyboard—you will eventually write a piece of a sentenceor even a whole sentence that sounds OK. You will go, \"Hey! That doesn'tsuck! Now I gotta keep going!\"Your zest is awakening.Now, what's size got to do with it?I used to think that 'the big picture' was the main thing.But over the course of my writing career I've come to realize two key things:1) The big picture can be overwhelming, thus a hindrance toan artist, and2) Small will get you to big.[Note on photo: I took this picture of a prison wall with a seed sprouting from it in Cartagena, Colombia.]Often, as writers, we don't even have the big picture, as ina fully-realized plot or a detailed outline, whether for fiction or nonfiction.If you feel you need the big picture but don't have it, that can lead toanxiety and tightness.But a general idea of where you want to go with your writingproject should suffice.To focus on the small, simply pay close attention to eachpiece of a scene, character, description, conversation or memory that you wantto present. If you feel stuck, don't flail around looking for what should comenext. Instead, try going back to something you've touched on but haven't fullyfleshed out. Write on it. Write deeper, write with more detail, write in the spiritof wanting to find things out rather than presenting them.Say you've written a scene that ends in a dramatic moment:somebody gets killed. Maybe it feels hard to get your story going again, toramp it up all over again. Try writing more deeply about the inner life of thatvictim before their life was snuffed out. Just pretend you're inside thatperson's head and heart and see what happens. What do you find there? How mightit fuel the rest of your story? For one thing, you can do a lot more with the peoplewho knew that victim in life.If you write in the spirit of discovery, you'll be propelledforward by your subject. Go along for the ride! Don't try to steer, just hangon and keep going! All kinds of wonderful things will happen: you'll find newvectors to explore, you'll learn things about your subject you didn't knowbefore, you'll realize that you ought to explore this territory next, tell thatanecdote next, introduce a new character so as to fully bring to life oneyou've already got, and so on. And as we know, lots of little things can add upto a big thing.If you simply keep doing that, every writing session, youwill be awestruck by the number of projects you start, finish, and ship outinto the world.Tell me what you think!

{"title": "Ava, Frank, O.J., and me", "date": "Thursday, September 26, 2013", "text": "For me, inspiration is the juice that you get from anexperience that leads you from where you were a minute ago to someplace bigger,deeper, more intense. It doesn't necessarily have to be a good or positive experience.Inspiration, for sure, can be a cliché: the beach at sunset,reading a poem about roses, listening to 'Light My Fire' on your headphones.I find tremendous inspiration in the city of Los Angeles, and that'swhy I set one of my mystery series there, starting with THE ACTRESS. Oh, God,the pace, the energy, the history of it all---glamour, crime, innovation, disaster,sex, rags to riches to rags.I lived on the West Coast for 17 years, and have spent lotsof time in L.A.It's an infuriating place---all those people trying to drive on the same roadyou are, the asbestos-like smog, the on-the-makeness, the crime (which is justa particularly lousy way to be on the make), the poison oak in Griffith Park.But! How sublime is the epicenter of American culture! Arguable?I simply say: the movies, custom cars, surfing, Watts Towers, and the weather.[I took the above photo at the Griffith Observatory. Love that Greek key detailing.]When I was in university, I got into reading Joan Didion,whose writing about L.A.I admired so much: so incisive, so caustic, so elegiac. Yes, somehow L.A. died for Joan, and she moved to New York, the next best thing.Well, L.A.sure isn't dead for everybody.One of the most intense experiences I've had in Los Angeleswas in the summer of 1995, when the O.J. Simpson murder trial was saturatingthe city like creosote on a wharf piling. I flew into LAX and boarded therental car shuttle bus, en route to a business meeting. The driver, abroad-shouldered black guy, greeted each of us with a cold stare. Once seated,I realized that the bus radio was tuned to the live broadcast of the Simpsontrial. Every single passenger on that bus was white. We were all these littlewhite businesspeople with our briefcases, and he was this stone-silent blackguy with his hands gripping the wheel, and we all listened to the trial together,without anyone uttering a word, for the ten-minute ride to the car lot.More recently, I was invited to dinner to a house in the Hollywood hills. My friend, an actor, and his wife werehouse- and dog-sitting for a director they knew, and they wanted some company,and I was in town. So my companion and I drove up those narrow twistingstreets, and found our friends in an aerie above the city with purple eveningcoming on. The house had this tremendous aura of swank, with warm maple woodfloors and ten-foot-high chiffon drapes screening the narrow deck. I remarkedon a framed photograph of Ava Gardner and Frank Sinatra on a wall.\"Oh, yeah, Ava used to own this place,\" I was told.\"The current owners keep that picture.\"Immediately my glamour glands started to pump, and I smelledthe lipstick and the spilled Scotch and the cigarette smoke, and thesplit-level house came almost alive. We drank wine in the billowing sensuousprivacy of the deck. The wind picked up and night came down, and we talked andlaughed about a thousand things.I'm looking forward to being in Los Angeles this weekend(Writer's Digest conference) and the next (workshops sponsored by Kleis TV).

{"title": "Tapping Your Inner Villain", "date": "Thursday, September 19, 2013", "text": "I find that writers areusually nice people. Nice people have a hard time understanding nasty people,let alone liking them. Let alone loving them!You must overcome this.Because even though youdeplore evil in real life, you must be able to embrace the evil mindset towrite a good novel, especially a mystery or thriller.Not to get allEnglish-majory on you, but I remember a pertinent lesson from studying theearly novel Gargantua and Pantagruel(Francois Rabelais) in university. To hyper-simplify what Rabelais tried toconvey in that vast satire: to be a man is to be a dog (with a dog's disgustinghabits and appetites), and the only way to fully be a man is to enjoy being a dog.There is our lesson forwriting villains successfully: to be an author is to be a villain, and the onlyway to fully be an author is to relish being a villain.Thus we must learn toenjoy playing in the dirt, oui?Even if your story willnot tell anything from their viewpoint, you really need to get to know yourvillains so they will act realistically and consistently. Brainstorming on yourbad guys will definitely help your plot as well as your characters.Reach into your owndark side for this one.1) Spend some timeremembering something awful you did that you were sorry for. The specifics areunimportant: remember how you feltwhen you were doing it. Jot a note or two.2) Now remembersomething awful you did that you're not a bit sorry for. Feel that feeling! Jota note or two.Those two simplepractices will instantly improve your empathy for your villains.Now, must your villainsbe bent on destruction and murder 24/7? Well, no.Real villains in thereal world often act like the nicest people ever. Ted Bundy worked a suicideprevention line while he was killing women who looked like the girlfriend whothrew him over. Jack the Ripper probably had friends. That BTK guy—rememberhim?—had a whole family, friends, a church…Your villains aremerely people acting in their own self-interest, feeding their own needs—onlywith total disregard for the rest of us. That is where they differ from normalpeople. The truly horrifying thing is, they don't have to differ all that much,to be effectively evil.I might add thatbelievable characters are always amix of good and bad; it's really just a matter of degree, and of course,perspective. The axe-murderer's mother will believe to her grave that he actedin self-defense. He will believe heacted in self-defense.Which leads us to moredepth: Think about your characters, and love them, in light of human failingslike self-delusion, unrealistic expectations, secret yearnings—yearnings thatcan't possibly come true.Enjoy the dirt, andreap the rewards!p.s.

{"title": "We Are All Impressionable Youth", "date": "Thursday, August 29, 2013", "text": "Mother Goose was probably the first author who really movedme. Her themes of adventure, naughtiness, suffering, and redemption resonatethrough much of contemporary literature, and I believe her influence is all toounsung. Feels good to be able to give her a plug here.My mother read me those. I also remember sitting on my father's knee listening toKipling's 'The Elephant's Child' and my dad's own made-up stories of Sinbad theSailor, which always seemed to involve a little girl who lost her dolly andcried in a bitter baby voice, then found her dolly in the end with the help ofSinbad. That doll showed up in the little girl's own back alley so often Ican't tell you.When I was in the first grade, my mother, age 40, decided toget a college degree and become a teacher. She enrolled in Eastern Michigan University and studiedEnglish literature and composition, and that was one of the signal events in mylife. Suddenly, at the very time I was learning to read, new and amazing books rushedinto the house. One was a gigantic anthology of children's literature thatpinned my thighs to the couch like a sack of concrete as it took me tomarvelous territories. I shuddered at the Norse myth of the brave Balder andthe horrible Loki,who fashioned his arrow from the Kryptonitic holly, the onlyplant that failed to take the oath of benignity at Balder's birth. My heart wasstirred by the cheerful inventiveness of the Borrowers, and by the deliciousvengefulness of Hansel and Gretel.Man, I thought, if only I had the guts to shove Mrs.[neighbor's name redacted] into her own red-hot oven! I read of theselflessness of the kids who wanted the Wheel on the School so the lucky storkcould nest there, and realized with an unpleasant feeling that if I were one ofthose kids, I probably wouldn't care all that much about the damn wheel,frankly.The act of reading, much moreso than going to catechism orenduring a scolding, was the thing that first got me to consciously examine myown moral code. I looked within myself and what did I find? Quite a selfishlittle girl! In the hard years since, I've achieved spotty success atrationalizing and camouflaging—and at times even overcoming!—that self-interest.I keep reading in order to gain greater expertise.My mother did in fact graduate from college, then taughthigh school English for ten years. Books flowed through our house. I rememberthe books I read way too early (Deliverance stands out), and the books Ishould have read at a youngish age but didn't bother to (The Heart is aLonely Hunter, one). From that, I guess I learned that a sensational storybeats a sensitive one almost every time. Think back to Loki.Life isn't fair, books teach us. But what a gift it is, theyalso teach us!

I should probably never leave it out,since it's one of the most important lessons on remembering I ever learned:Years ago I had the opportunity to attend classes for a dayat Harvard Law School. A friend of mine was a student there, and she invited mefor a visit. So we're at the morning lecture in this huge amphitheater, we'resitting at these long, curved wooden desks set in tiers, exactly like you'veseen in the movies. Nobody had a laptop or a tablet because laptops hadn't beeninvented yet, let alone digital tablets.The professor is talking rapidly, giving information, legaltheory, opinions, all this data. And sometimes she's calling on students, andthey're answering, and all this good perspective is happening on the data, and I realize that thestudents are just sitting there.I opened my notebook and wrote, \"Why isn't anybodytaking notes?\" and slid it over to my friend. She wrote back, \"You listen.\" Underlined.And it was like, donngg.Epiphany.I remembered back to my first job as a newspaper reporter.Sometimes a source would talk so fast you couldn't write it all down, even inthe rudimentary shorthand most of us used. Since exact quotes were important,especially if the person was a public official, I'd shift from writing mode tolistening mode. (The picture is supposed to suggest 'listening' because of the headphones. Best I can do right now.) I remember feeling my attention sharpening, as my brain focusedon absorption. Then I'd race off as soon as the interview was over and writedown whatever relevant words might have escaped my pen.Sitting in that Harvard classroom, I realized that whenyou're taking notes, it's almost like you're too busy writing words to reallyabsorb what's being said. Since then, I take far fewer notes in any listening /learning situation, and guess what? Right! I retain more. Usually I make notes afterward, and that reinforces myrecall.So, for the next class, workshop, or conference session you attend, try doing the same.Relax, listen, and write half a page of notes later—just the main highlights.Let me know how it works for you, OK?To post your ideas / comments (all of which I read and try to respond to), clickbelow where it says, 'No Comments,' or '2 Comments,' or whatever.If you'd like to receive this blog automatically as anemail, look to the right, above my bio, and subscribe there.

He feels a strong compulsion to make patterns out ofnatural things: twigs, stones, flower petals, busted-up ice. His name is AndyGoldsworthy, and he's a famous artist, and he's made art all over the world.Some of it is totally ephemeral—it'll be resorbed by nature in a day or aweek—and some of it would be considered 'permanent': carefully built dry-stonewalls, for instance.But of course, the whole point is that nothing's permanent,everything changes, everything that comes will someday go.So why make anything? Why do anything?Because eternity is to be found in any honest activity, beit lining up fern stems in a spiral pattern that almost makes you cry to beholdit, or running a dry-cleaners in a strip plaza.A few years ago, Goldsworthy was quoted in Time: \"Right in front of your faceis the stuff you choose to ignore.\"A contrast to Andy Goldsworthy, yet totally heroicallysimilar, is Mark Borchardt, working-class auteur best known as the subject ofthe 1999 documentary \"American Movie: The Making of Northwestern.\"He's a guy who wanted to make a movie, not just any movie, but his firm visionof a movie.The thing is, Mark appears to have zero artisticpretensions. He didn't go to film school, he didn't go to Hollywood and workhis way up, he just did what he had to do right where he was, in Milwaukee,Wisconsin, with whatever the hell sparse money and resources he could scrapeup. Instead of finishing \"Northwestern,\" he wound up making a horrorshort called \"Coven\" (which he pronounced \"Coe-ven\").\"American Movie,\" won a big prize at Sundance andcalled lots of attention to Mark, and since then he's been a minor celebrity, dippingin and out of public view, slowly working on another picture.\"Coven\" essentially sucks, but that's beside thepoint. Deep at Mark's core lies a bluntly heroic artist.Mark on inspiration:\"I don't care about making a movie, but I care aboutmaking a movie that's spiritually satisfying.\"On artistic integrity:\"It's like a poem, dude: 'My girlfriend punched me inmy right eye, broke the glass coffee table.' That can't be altered. No oneco-writes that with you.\"On achievement:\"I've always been my own worst enemy, and that's a hellof a fight.\"Andy and Mark are guys I've learned a lot from.[photo info: Andy Goldsworthy's Arch at Goodwood, imageharvested from Wikipedia Commons]Tell us what you think!

Because as soon as you release tension from yourjaw muscles—which seem to be the first to get tight when we're anxious aboutwhat we're doing—the head, neck, and the rest of the body naturally follow.Professional-level singers and actors employ this techniqueall the time. That stands to reason, but I never thought it could apply toanything else until I learned that tuned-in athletes do it too.I tried it while writing and it works. It's astonishing how wellit works, and it's dismaying to find tension creeping back after mere secondsor minutes. A radical lesson in control and receptivity, as well as an opportunityfor improving one's body awareness.Now you try it.

{"title": "The Humble Path to Triumph", "date": "Thursday, July 25, 2013", "text": "The other day I was listening to a radio program thatlikened sensible investing to the Roald Amundsen expedition to the South Pole,while stupid investing is like Robert Falcon Scott's expedition to the sameplace at the same time.It was, frankly, a race. Both parties got there, butAmundsen (Norway) got there first, and he and his men got back alive. UnlikeScott (England) and his. The radio hosts (unknown, just caught a few minutes)said that the main difference was that Amundsen required his men and dogs totravel 15 nautical miles per day, no matter the conditions, while Scott's partytraveled more when conditions were good, less when they weren't.The key emphasis: While Amundsen led his men out in badconditions to make their 15 miles, he also PREVENTED his party from travelingmore than 15 miles a day. By this method his men and dogs were fresher at alltimes. \"Fifteen miles? Dudes, we're done! Let's pitch them tents and gnawon some butter sticks!\" No periods of extreme exhaustion, no anxiety tomake up for time lost hunkering in bad weather.I read up on this and found that there were more differencesbetween the expeditions, like the plain fact that Amundsen's party was betterprepared and used simpler equipment, and the fact that Scott's expeditionincluded lots of stopping to gather scientific data, which took not just timebut energy.What all this has to do with investing I don't know exactlybecause I didn't hear the whole program, but I'd guess we're talking prudenceand patience.But I do know what Amundsen and Scott have to do with uswriters.In recent years due to challenging life conditions I put offwriting new fiction, waiting, as it were, for the weather to clear. It tooksome pressure off, but put other pressure on.Because I knew I SHOULD be writing fiction in spite of theother demands on my time and energy, in spite of the other obligations—writingand otherwise—I'd taken on, and I was always a little uneasy.One day I woke up and realized that 1) the weather mightnever fully clear, and 2) it was futile to expect, or wish, for it to clear.Under those conditions, I needed to be happy with small butsteady fiction output. Once I accepted that, things flowed better, and guesswhat? I'm on my way to the pole. Gonna plant that flag.Join me.How's it going with your writing?

{"title": "WILL TALK WRITING FOR MARTINIS", "date": "Thursday, July 18, 2013", "text": "Aspiring authors sometimes ask me whether they should go toa writing conference.The short answer is yes, if it's one I'm going to bespeaking at.Your remaining options in 2013 are:·        Writer's Digest West, in Los Angeles September27-29. All information here: http://tinyurl.com/c76lmtu. I'll be doing two presentations, one onSaturday afternoon ('How to Write a Dynamite Mystery or Thriller that Sells'),the other Sunday morning ('Quit Your Day Job—Seriously!).·        Florida Writer's Association, in Lake Mary,Florida (Orlando) October 18-20. All information here: http://floridawriters.net/2013_FWA_Conferences.htmlFor this one I'll be doing 'How to Write a Dynamite Mystery or Thriller thatSells.'At both of these conferences you'll meet and learn fromother experienced professionals, be able to buy books and get them signed, andnot least, you'll meet other aspiring writers.The longer answer to \"Should I go to aconference?\" is this: Conferences cost time and money, and you need to bereasonably sure the conference you pick will be worth it. The best way to pick a conference is read the schedule and see who thefaculty is. If your writerly heart beats faster while reading a sessiondescription, pay attention. If this happens three or more times, seriouslyconsider going to that conference.Star appeal is a funny question. Most conferences feature oneor two brand-name authors, and if a particular author is an idol of yours, itwould be cool to meet that person. You'd naturally want to thank them forwriting the books they do, and hey, maybe it would be possible to pick theirbrain on the art and business of writing, if only for a few minutes.Trouble is, the bigger the name, the more they'll be overrunby fans (or cornered by overt opportunists), and the less chance you'll have ofmaking contact. I remember being at a huge conference that featured a marquee authorI really wanted to meet. I went to his session, and that was neat, but afterwardhe was so totally swarmed that I never got a chance to talk with him one on one.So if you do meet up with that big-name author, great! Butthe more rewarding approach is to focus on learning new things and makingfriends. There is absolutely no way Facebook or Twitter can give you the sortof connection that just hanging out with somebody can. I should probably standin the hotel bar holding a sign that says, \"WILL TALK WRITING FOR MARTINIS.\"(I will absolutely talk writing for martinis.) Moreover, most presenters try to be as available as possibleduring conferences, not just at the official meet-n-greets. I like to hang outafter my presentation and answer questions I couldn't get to in the timeallotted. If I have to vacate the room for the next speaker, I pull oversomewhere nearby (ideally a corridor with a comfy chair or two!) and listen toaspiring writers and try to help them.Apart from the presenters, there are your fellowparticipants. If, when you look in the mirror, you see a nice, interesting,caring person there (and I know you do), you will be amazed at how many nice,interesting, caring people you will find at a writing conference!It's true. Writers tend to be terrific people. Smile,schmooze, and make friends. Some friendships will last a lifetime. It's happened tome.Have you attended a writing conference?

{"title": "How to Write Scared", "date": "Thursday, July 11, 2013", "text": "In my undergraduate days I hung out with other students whoquestioned the value of book-learning over direct experience. There's a lot tobe said for direct experience, and one of the direct experiences I had wasgetting stoned.This happened several times.One night I was visiting a friend at her apartment offcampus, where we enjoyed some of the latest imports, and it was time for me toget back to my dorm, some ten miles away. We went out to her car. I headedtoward the passenger door but she stopped me, pushed her keys into my hand, and said, \"You drive.\"\"Oh, I'm too stoned.\"\"Elizabeth. You've got to learn to drive stoned.\"Although these days I'm known for prudent judgment and astrong sense of social responsibility, in those days I was not.\"Well, how do I learn to drive stoned?\" Iinquired.\"By driving stoned.\"\"Oh.\"\"You just have to believe you can do it.\"At the moment, the logic was pure and powerful. So I gotbehind the wheel, believing I could drive perfectly well stoned, including thepart of the route that went past the state police post. In fact I drove back tocampus perfectly well.I took from that experience an important lesson, and it wasthis: An impairment need not be an impediment.Needless to say, I don't advocate driving under theinfluence of anything but caffeine. But this lesson relates to much in life,especially writing.Fear comes to all writers sometimes: fear of failure, fearof success, fear of mediocrity. Fear makes you tighten up. Tightness is nogood. Therefore, it's a fact that the state of fear is an impairment. But itneed not be an impediment.The cool, fantastic reality is that we don't have tovanquish fear in order to write with zest and freedom. If you're too scared towrite, just write a little bit and see how you feel.Understand that the way to consistent output in writing isto be able to write under any emotional load. And there is no trick ortechnique to doing it.Every day, simply act on your writing goals, no matter howgood you've gotten at inventing obstacles for yourself, like anxiety. Welcomecold fear, let it rush to you, fangs foaming.Then go about your writing.Surprisingly, your fear will snuggle up close to you whileyou write. It will get warm.What's fear but another friend, anyway?Breaking news p.s.:I'll be presenting two sessions at Writer's Digest Conference West, Sept 27 - 29 in Los Angeles.  Early registration before July 19 is $50 off the full price.http://www.writersdigestconference.com/ehome/61986/speaker/Sessions by me:\"How to Write a Dynamite Mystery or Thriller That SELLS\"and \"Quit Your Day Job - Seriously!\"More on this soon. I welcome your comments!

{"title": "A Quill on the Fourth", "date": "Thursday, July 4, 2013", "text": "Given that I'm writing this on Independence Day for theUnited States, wouldn't you think my theme should be independence? Wrong! I'm awriting nerd, and there's an opportunity here, but it's not idealism.Here's the Declaration of Independence, this image stolendirectly from the National Archives web site. Have you ever seen such abeautiful job of penmanship? (The reproduction doesn't do it justice.)There's tons of history about the draft and the revisionsand then the finished Declaration, which was famously engraved on broadsheetsand distributed to the American people as soon as it was ratified by the Congress.When I was a small child, I was given a modern reproduction,nicely printed on aged-looking heavy paper. I looked at it a lot, wondering howanybody could write that beautifully, and I decided it was because they used abeautiful pen, the feather quill.Being a little word nerd, I developed a fascination withwriting instruments, papers, and so forth, but my handwriting never looked good,and I never tried writing with a quill pen until today.For a long time I thought that John Hancock actually wroteout the document, given that his signature was so big and bold and centered, asif he had the right to sign it so. But today I learned that a guy named TimothyMatlack, who assisted the secretary of the Congress (Charles Thomson) is probablythe one wrote it out all nice and neat. Hancock simply jumped right in there,front and center, with that signature. There's a lesson somewhere in there.I've since lost my copy of the document, but I did see thatsignature many times afterward: I dated a boy in school who happened to be namedJohn Hancock. Early in life he learned to write his name exactly like thefamous one—quite a feat using the ballpoint pens we all used then. I rememberus checking books out of the library together once—this in the days when youhad to write your name on the card that resided in a pocket inside every book'scover—and the librarian getting angry about John's signature, thinking he wasfooling around. This was also in the days before student I.D.s, so John had noway of proving that was his real name. Together we convinced her, as Iremember.Upon getting up this morning, I got out a vulture featherI'd found on the golf course last year, figuring I'd make a quill pen out of itsomeday. I had washed it when I found it, so it was theoretically disease-free.I looked up how to cut a quill on line, and realized if Iwere to do it right, I couldn't do it today, because you're supposed to let thefeather soak in water overnight, then let it dry, then heat the quill end insand that you've warmed in your oven or on your stovetop, and this will temperthe quill (which I guess means make it harder), then you must get the rightsort of blade to cut it with, then do your very fine cutting which cannot be achievedjust right by any idiot on the first try, and gosh it all seemed totallyhopeless.So I just took my feather and my miniature Swiss Army knifeand hacked a point, split it, and dipped it in some brown Pelikan ink. Duringcoffee delivery by my loving muse, I opened a sketchbook and gave it a shot. Ididn't make it through the first sentence of the Declaration, and my resultlooks like hell, but here it is:Happy Fourth, happy writing, and God bless America.I welcome your comments!

{"title": "Bad Writer, Good Writer, Great Writer", "date": "Thursday, June 27, 2013", "text": "What's the difference between a bad writer, a good writer,and a great writer?When I was a college freshman, my English professor said,\"Lots of young people want to write. But before you write, you must firsthave something to say.\"The message was: The yearning to write is not sufficient toproduce something worthwhile to read.At the time, I thought that was an extremely wise insight.Later, having written a book or two, I realized that greatwriters do not write because they have something to say. They write in order tofind out something, or to get at something. Writing like that canbe as thrilling for the reader as for the writer. You can get fire and ice thatway.Moreover, even if you begin a piece of writing knowing quiteexactly what you want to say, if you’re relaxed about it you’ll find yourheartbrain going off in interesting, unexpected directions. And if you beginwith nothing but your pencil and a sense of vague desperation, you’ll eventuallyfind yourself focusing and sharpening on somethingworthwhile, and smiling as you go.I've learned that way too many writers get confused andthink they're preachers.Bad writers preach badly: \"Mean people suck and shouldbe hated.\"Good writers preach well: \"Mean people suck and shouldbe pitied.\"Great writers draw on their deepest courage and humility:\"Mean people are the likes of you and me.\"Nobody needs a preacher. Just shed light. Great writing is ajourney of discovery, and it can be undertaken by anybody.I welcome your comments!

{"title": "Don't Feed the Lunkheads", "date": "Thursday, June 20, 2013", "text": "Every artist strives to produce amazing, fabulous, original work.No authentic artist, however, strives to produce perfect work.Why not? Two reasons:One, the very act of striving for perfection hampers free expression. I mean, that's true by definition: since perfection is impossible on this earth—given how molecules sort of squish around all over the place and all, even those of precise instruments such as laser beams and Stradivarius violins—it follows that striving for the impossible is futile. And futile effort cannot result in free, fullhearted creativity, no way.On some level our heartbrain knows this. If we consciously try for perfection—that is, the impossible—our heartbrain will quietly but forcefully go to war against that. Result: anxiety, doubt, fear, and crappy work.Two, an audience who can tell junk from real art will intuitively reject any product of a perfectionistic artist. Another term for perfectionist is control freak. The product of such a person will be brightly polished and free from cosmetic mistakes. As such, it will be pretty and it will fool lunkheads who will probably buy it. And it will have no soul.Do not feed the lunkheads.Go after the audience you want—that is, an audience who will appreciate you and will stick with you—by forgetting perfection and going at it headlong, reckless, and grinning like a maniac.End note:I welcome your comments!

{"title": "Good Writing Doesn't Flinch", "date": "Thursday, June 13, 2013", "text": "Recently I was at a party and spent some time talking withand getting to know a firefighter. Given my early experience as a reporter, I'mcomfortable asking probing questions of strangers.Since this firefighter was female, I indulged my curiosityabout the aspects of the job that require physical strength. She gave herheight and weight: a couple of inches shorter than me, and only five pounds heavier,definitely not a thick chick. Yet she said she could deadlift 225 pounds, whichjust astounded me. (By contrast, I can probably deadlift forty pounds max,unless I have to lift a car off of a baby, in which case I would run like hellto find somebody with muscles.) (A deadlift is where the barbell starts on theground, and you bend down and lift it with straight arms until your back isstraight, which makes the bar end up around your knees. Lower it and you'vecompleted one rep.)The firefighter said that her strength strategy, to keep upwith the guys, was to acknowledge that she couldn't lift as much as most malefirefighters at one time, but she had trained so that she could repeat liftingheavy weights more times than most of the male firefighters. \"So I can'tlift as much, but I can repeat and endure as long or longer than they can, anda lot of the job is endurance, rather than explosive strength.\"(OK, I didn't have a picture of a female firefighter. These guys work putting out flames in Puerto Vallarta, Mexico. Don't you love the Spanish word for them?: Bomberos!)Then I asked the firefighter how she copes with theemotional vicissitudes of the job, thinking of the broken bodies she dealswith, being that firefighters do a lot of EMT work as well.Here is what she said: \"We get there after it's over.We don't see the trauma occur, so we don't get that shock. We don't see the legbreaking, we don't see the stroke happening.\"And I realized that that's a huge difference, one I neverthought about. Certainly the job can be traumatizing, but it's not like Ithought.She went on, \"And if somebody's dead, they're dead, andit's all over for them. Nothing's going on.\"What about the survivors? I wondered how she deals withtheir grief and shock.\"We get in, we do our job, and we get out.\"In other words, they don't stick around.Because, really, the only way they can survive is to notbecome emotionally involved in the dramatic, often defining moments, of otherpeople's lives.What does this have to do with writing?As writers, we must be like firefighters and we must not belike them.We must be like them in that when the shit goes down, wehave to jump in our truck and rush to it. But of course we must create the shitthat goes down, and we must be different from firefighters. We must stickaround.We must be there for the tough stuff, we must be deeplyinvolved in it, we must not gloss over trouble, agony, difficulty. We must bethere deeply because we want our readers to be there deeply. So we have to show the leg breaking. The heartbreaking. The bullet piercing the flesh, the fire licking the Picasso, thefloodwater inching toward the nostrils. And we must show these things asvividly as possible, discomfort bedammed.Of course, we as writers also get to indulge in the flipside: We get to be there for the ecstasy, and we must not only let our readersknow it's happening, we must portray it as deeply as we portray the pain.Sometimes this is even more a challenge than portrayingsuffering! Why is that? I think it's because suffering is drama, while joyis…well, joy is nice.Which is why novels go like this: \"Once upon a time, adreadful thing happened. But they lived happily ever after.\" instead oflike this: \"Once upon a time they lived happily ever after.\"Gotta have that drama, gotta have that suffering!I welcome your comments.

{"title": "The Curse of Vocabulary", "date": "Thursday, June 6, 2013", "text": "A friend of mine once found himself in civil court,defending himself against a lawsuit in front of a jury. Before he took thewitness stand, his lawyer told him, \"Whatever you do, talk plainly. Jurorsdon't like witnesses who use fancy words.\"\"OK,\" he said.On the stand, the lawyer's first question was, \"And howdid you feel when you found out you were being sued?\"My friend exclaimed, \"I was flummoxed!\"He prevailed against the suit in spite of that, but he saidthe look on his lawyer's face still haunts him.I remembered that story when I went into a hardware store ina rural area not long ago. I wanted a particular tool that I'd noticed for saleelsewhere. I couldn't find one on the shelves so I asked for help. Two clerks,good ole boys both, came to my aid, and we scanned a large display of tools,trying to find what I wanted.I said, \"I kind of can't believe you guys don't havethese; they're so….so…\" and I paused, because the word I wanted to use was'ubiquitous,' but I looked at these country guys and I thought, \"OK, donot say 'ubiquitous.' Think of any word but 'ubiquitous.'\"The seconds passed like centuries.The guys waited politely for me to finish my sentence, untilfinally I accepted my fate and came out with it: \"ubiquitous!\"They looked at me in silence, then after a moment we alldecided I probably didn't need that tool anyway.For a writer, a large vocabulary is almost always a blessing.But at times it does feel like the opposite. I knew that for sure as I got intomy car in that hardware store parking lot, cursing like a gynecomorphous canislupus familiarus."},
{"title": "The Real Thing: A Route 66 Placemat!", "date": "Tuesday, May 28, 2013", "text": "What does a cheesy, mass-produced placemat have to do withgood writing?Short answer: simplicity.Because I've long felt that most writing instruction isneedlessly complex (I don't even like the term 'instruction'), my chiefguideline while writing YOU'VE GOT A BOOK IN YOU was simplicity.Simplicity in the ideas I developed, simplicity in mypresentation of them. The best teachers, as we know, merely point the way.I first got the idea of the Route 66 placemat when creatinga webinar for Writer's Digest University on writing mysteries and thrillers. Myconcern was plotting. I expanded on the 'heart-clutching moment' plottingmethod I'd first written about Writer's Digest magazine, then put together a simplifiedversion of the classic 'hero's adventure' framework.Then, something even more basic—one might even sayrustic—occurred to me, which can incorporate both methods, really, while beingtotally 'graspable'. A story's plot, I reasoned, is like a map—is a map—and I thought of the simplestmap I'd ever seen, which was a Route 66 placemat. Here it is:[With thanks to the Hoffmaster Company of Oshkosh,Wisconsin, for their generous permission.]I developed the idea in the proposal for my book, and thenfurther in the book itself.The Route 66 placemat map is a powerful symbol of movementand simplicity, perfect for writing.Because every book, fiction or nonfiction, is a journey forthe writer and for the reader. And ideally it's an adventure too, filled withzest and new vistas.Just as drivers need a map to get from Chicago to LosAngeles, we as authors need some sort of map to get from \"It was a darkand stormy night,\" to \"THE END.\" And for the journey to open usto the joys, terrors, and opportunities of the unexpected, that map should beas simple and flexible as possible. The beauty is that a simple map lets youget into virtually endless complexity—side trips, backtracks, interconnectionsand junctions—without encumbrance.A good lesson for writing, and a good lesson for life!I submitted a bunch of photographs and other images with themanuscript, but Writer's Digest Books only included a few of them in thepublished book, the reason being that the images would have put the page countover a threshold that would have put the price of the book too high. My otherchoice would have been to cut pages of text, which I didn't want to do.So to my sorrow, the book does not include an image of theRoute 66 placemat.But I'm glad to present it here, just for the hell of it.I'll publish other images that didn't get into the book here,with explanations and more insights.I welcome your comments!

{"title": "My First HCM (Heart-Clutching Moment)", "date": "Tuesday, May 21, 2013", "text": "When I was visiting my mother about five years ago, shehanded me a piece of paper and said, \"I think this is the first thing youever wrote.\"It is a half sheet of lined paper on which I had written anaccount of an important event in my mother's and my life, that is the death ofher father. I titled it, \"My Grandfather's Furenal.\" It wasn't reallyabout the 'furenal'; it was about the news of his death. I was six when thisoccurred, and the moment impressed itself on me deeply, as did the three days Ispent with the family hanging around the mortuary where Grandpa was laid out.I'd only met my grandfather a few times (he lived in another state), but he hadbeen a friendly presence. The transcription is at the end of this post.I must have written the account when I was eight or nine, onone of the two impossibly heavy typewriters we had in the house, secondhandmodels that were old and outdated even then. (One was an Underwood, the otherprobably a Remington.) But boy, were they satisfying to use! I can still smellthe machine oil and the ribbons, can still feel the resistance of the keys,that smooth progressive weird sensation that ends with a dry pop! and a release, over and over.Not everything about progress is good.My point is this: we all respond to significant moments inlife, whether we are children or adults. Moreover, we respond to themvicariously, in the books we read (fiction and nonfiction), the movies we see,the jokes we hear at the tavern.In my articles for Writer'sDigest and in You've Got a Book inYou, I call these heart-clutching moments, or HCMs. They tend to be themore genuine, intense moments of life. Birth, death, betrayal, a stroke of luck,a bolt of passion, an instant of grace, a pang of conscience, a disaster—theseare just a few sorts of heart-clutching moments.HCMs are the fuel that drives stories forward, and they arethe string that binds your readers to you.The little six-year-old me was so impressed by a message ofdeath that the little eight-year-old me felt compelled to document it. I don'tknow who I expected would read it, but somehow I felt it was the mostworthwhile thing I had to offer the world.Grownup writers sometimes feel that to put in HCMs is to beexploitative, and so they tone them down.

{"title": "Welcome to Zestful Writing by Elizabeth Sims", "date": "Wednesday, May 15, 2013", "text": "For years, people have been asking me if I'd ever launch ablog. I've guest-blogged, but have resisted the terrifying commitment of doinga blog of my own. Until today.Why now? Well, really, this blog is to mark a milestone inmy journey as a writer, that being the publication of my first book on writing.You've Got a Book in You: A Stress-FreeGuide to Writing the Book of Your Dreams, published by Writer's DigestBooks, is now out in wide release. ('Wide release' makes it sound like a movie,perhaps a romantic comedy about a young couple who dream of escaping their9-to-5 drudgery by team-authoring thrillers set in exotic locales. I likethat.)Why the book? Because for a long time, when meeting someonenew who learned that I was a published author of novels and a contributingeditor at Writer's Digest magazine, 87% of them said, \"Oh, I'd like towrite a book too!\" and would naturally ask for advice.I'd respond as best I could, but it always amounted to abrush-off. Seeking something to recommend, I read a few of the most popularhow-to-write books, and was dismayed by how often their authors asserted thatwriting is hard. Very hard. It'll-break-your-soul hard. Also, I realized thatmost authors, even very successful ones, feel that same way.Well, hell.That was not what I had learned over the years of writing abunch of novels. I learned—taught myself—that writing a book is easy and fun,provided we jettison doubt and fear, and write with a relaxed, free heart.Reject struggle; embrace zest!So I wrote You've Gota Book in You to get that message out, and to offer writers tools they canuse to teach themselves how to write freely and well.My aim with this blog is to continue to explore the ideas Ideveloped in the book, and to document my journey, as a writer, teacher, andperson.I know I'll learn a lot as I go, and I hope you will too.
