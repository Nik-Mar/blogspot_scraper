{"title": "Diary of a Hardworking Homemaker's Start to a New Year", "date": null, "text": "Saturday:  We did two things this day.  First, we attended one of the sweetest, nicest, funniest, tear making weddings we have ever been to.  It's not a first marriage for either one but the two people are genuinely nice folks, well thought of by many.  We met the groom about three years ago and I liked it him right away.  He's super intelligent and funny and classy.  I don't know the bride, but I've heard remarkable things about her.  They met only a few short months ago and they were immediately smitten.  To see the deep and tender love they had for one another as they took their vows was amazing.  The pastor laughed and cried right along with the congregation who came to see this couple united.  It was one of those sorts of weddings that end up making you feel you were blessed to be there.Then we drove from the church down to the Georgia coastal town where our son lives to see him and his children.   I realized about halfway through that I'd forgotten my phone at home.  I could tell John just where it was, too...When Kate called later to say she was going to our house to pick up the TENS unit I asked her to check.  Sure enough, my phone was just where I'd said it was.  Good to know.  Five hours down and we arrived weary and worn to be greeted by bored teens.  Our son cooked a meal for us and made coffee.  We gave the bored children their gifts and after visiting for a few hours we went to the hotel where we literally fell into bed and went right to sleep.Sunday:  I thought, being so far from home and as near the coast as we were, that the temperatures would be warmer down South but no, they were just as chilly as they'd been here at home.  Glad I took along my new winter coat (so cozy and lovely) and warm comfy clothes to wear back home for the long ride back.  It was a beautiful day, sunny and bright and clear but so chilly!  We generally stop at a Dairy Queen in a small town halfway through the journey for a break. Today we stopped for lunch since it was gone past noon when we arrived.  I discovered that the $5 meal deal (burger, fries, drink and small sundae) now is a $7 meal deal.  Still a decent value but price hike just as everywhere else.  We ate lunch and hit the road again.  We arrived home about 3pm.  Six hours today to get back.  We were done when we got home.  We got hit with family trials almost as soon as we walked in.  Not directed at us, but the suffering of a portion of our family over life situations that none of us can control.  It's a hard season to watch anyone walk through and as with most things it affects us as well as them.  But we will all get through.  I'm trying to find the balance of what to say when I can't be 100% comforting and be truthful, too.  I'd heaps rather say, \"This is awful.  It's hard.  It will get better, but no one can predict what day or when and, in the meantime, you just have to go through it,\" than to say, \"It's gonna get better.\"  Not to discourage mind you but to encourage by telling it as it will be.  It will be better.  One day.  An elusive day we can none of us know, but one day it will be better.  But getting through until then is hard and hurtful.I cooked a freezer entree from May.  It tasted good.  I also made a salad, frozen peas and sliced bread.Monday:  I've given up being superstitious about New Year's Day, but I did have fun a week or so ago reading Landon Talks on Instagram in which a lot of Southerners shared the superstitions, sayings/warnings they'd heard all their lives long about New Year's.  Some I'd heard and heard often as I was growing up.  And some of us have held on to a few of them over the years and then discovered that after all, nothing dire or harmful befell us as the year unfolded other than all the usual stuff we'd seen all along.Today I am nodding at tradition, but not to superstition.  We'll be having Pork Chops, Creamed Cabbage, Black Eye Peas and Rice.  All things I had on hand already.  Today, I have kept grandchildren, cooked, labored, sorted, fussed, laughed, given advice, cleaned, encouraged, puzzled over things and collapsed in my chair to rest. I have, in other words, lived life.  If we're to start out the New Year as we expect it to continue, then today I did just that.  I made buns for the simple Hamburger Scramble I cooked at lunch time.  The children all opted for peanut butter jelly sandwiches and the boys ate two sandwiches then ate a bun as well.  Millie ate nothing.  She looked at it, she touched it.  She drank the soda she requested.  Then she asked in her tiny voice \"Can I be done?\"  I'm not going to fuss if a child isn't going to eat.  I did note that the moment she saw her daddy she asked for candy. lol   There's always room for candy. I blew all the dirt and leaves and grass off the porches.  I'm by no means done with porches this week but I started.  Then I sorted out the pile of stuff in the guest room and now have a sizeable donation pile.  That's pretty much my beautiful, sunny New Year's Day.  I hope yours was a wonderful day of living as well.Tuesday:  We hung about the house until nearly noon today.  I wasn't even sure we were actually going off but then when I'd started a job (and isn't that the way it usually goes?) and was socked deep into it, I heard John open our closet door and turn on the light.  I looked at the mess on my countertops and said \"Well....\"  I left it all as it was and got myself ready to go.  We loaded up the stuff in the back bedroom that I'd sorted out yesterday afternoon.    There were some things I knew I was not going to use in the kitchen any longer and I'd initially set them aside, but I said to myself, \"No.  I don't want them any longer.  I got good use from them all these years, but I'm really done with them.  Why shove them in the shed?  Let someone else be as thrilled over finding them as I was once upon a time.\"  I didn't have anything I really wanted to use to hold the flour, sugar, and brown sugar, since I was donating the canister set, but I used what I had.  That will do in the meantime.  And that was my purpose.  To let go of what I didn't want and to use what I have until I can do better.We loaded up donations which left me with just the stuff meant to go into the shed for storage in the bedroom. We headed off to run our errands which included dropping off some bills at the post office.  Bills, I'll add, that are absolutely going to have to have wings and winged feet in order to make it to the offices they are going to by the due dates. I don't know how big city post offices work but our little town offices do not send out mail on Sundays or holidays and only have a once-a-day pick-up.  I got stuff mailed in time to go out with today's mail.  That was the best I could do.  If I must pay fees this next month then I shall have to pay fees.  It was about halfway to our destination that I remember the stuff meant to be shipped back via UPS that I should have grabbed.While we were out, Katie texted.  That household has been through the worst lot of sickness.  Ear infections for both the children, and coughs all around.  Katie now has a horrible sinus infection, coughed so hard she threw her back out, then ended up with double ear infections herself. Katie called so we could talk to Caleb who looks and sounds as sick as all the others.  He cried and cried saying \"I want to come home to you and Grampa.\"  Bless him.  I've missed him, too, but we keep reminding him that he IS at home, he just comes to us to visit, a fact which made him weep all the harder today.We got haircuts and dropped off donations.  When we got home, we discovered the workmen had come by and picked up sawhorses and excess materials.  John said, \"I guess they're done.\"  I told him, \"Well I don't think so; they'll definitely be back.\"  \"Why?\"  \"Because the ladders on the porch are theirs...\"  I kid you not, five minutes later we got a call from the contractor asking if the ladders were here.  He told John they'd be in tomorrow to finish things off.  They have a big project job starting next week and they are hustling hard to finish up all the last little things on several jobs.We had a very late lunch today of bologna sandwiches with tomato soup and mandarins.  I don't think we'll have supper tonight because lunch was so very late.Wednesday:  I have been busy as could be all morning long.  I'd been meant to have Caleb, but Katie was unable to get him an appointment yesterday, so she has one today, I think.  Lots of sicknesses going about amongst that household.  I thought I could tackle my closet task I'd put off before Christmas...Well, so I thought.  Instead, I got busy on a whole different but equally as heavy-duty task of emptying and reorganizing the guest room closet.  John must have been equally inspired because he began working on the music room at the same time. Which meant as I was shoving things out of the closet in the guest room, he was shoving things in from the music room.    Result: I now have all the things back in the guest room that we'd moved out in November 2022 and have completely reorganized the guest room closet, removed everything going back to the master bathroom, started a new donation pile and added to the 'go to the shed' pile.  It is truth that while the guest room closet is neat as a pin, the guest room, our bedroom and the master bathroom look like someone tossed a bomb into them.  I am taking a much-needed rest break before tackling the next lot of work.And I still haven't done a thing to my closet...I'm telling you sorting out the house has been intense.  As we worked this morning the workman was here finishing off the last of the bathroom storage area.  It looks so nice!  He came to tell us goodbye before he left and left his number with John.  We truly appreciated this man and enjoyed his presence in our home.  In fact, we liked both the workmen, but we especially appreciated Travis.  later:  The messes haunted me.  I've now cleared up the guest room somewhat, gotten all the things put away in our bathroom, sorted out loads of stuff as I put away and condensed things down.  We have a LOT of stuff is all I'm saying and I'm really going to seriously consider how I can reduce some of this down further as the year goes on.  It's nice to have stock in some things but others...It's just clutter!  That's all there is to it.  And you never know how much of it is clutter until you're trying to put it away and struggling to fight off overwhelm.The bathroom storage space is nice to have, but it's now full except for a way up high shelf I can never reach, lol.  I don't have a door on that space, and I won't miss having one.  For the most part anytime the bathroom door is open, the space is hidden behind it.  But I think that while I could probably make it look nicer if I bought matching bins to sort of hide things.  I believe they have some on sale at Target...and I do have a gift card I could use...Thursday:  Oh dear...Shall the endless organizing, moving, shifting, fixing and putting things to rights once more ever end?  I have done nothing more to the porches beyond adding stuff to the back porch and blowing the debris from them.  But inside?  I've worked myself to nubbins every single day.  Today we got up really early.  We both woke about 5am and here we are at 5pm with nary a nap between us.  After I'd done minor housekeeping, made breakfast, etc., we headed out to make the Amazon and Target returns and to pick up a Target pick-up order which included matching bins for the bathroom.  I threw in a trip to the chaotic Kroger I don't really like but I treated myself to a Chai Latte with a decaf Expresso shot.  That's the only one I've had since the weather turned cold.  It was lovely.I was bit smacked by the meat prices today.  Seriously, this store seldom marks down much but bakery items.  The meat markdowns today included two filet mignons for $25 (not for me!) and a 1.17-pound package of the thinnest sirloin I've seen for $10.  What?!  No thanks!  There was no sign at all of the on-sale ground meat.  Our state is not included in the current ground meat recall, so it must just be another of the Kroger sale unavailability thing.We came right home from the store and ate lunch here after I'd put groceries away.  I sat in my chair for a bit but then told John I had to get into my closet today and get it sorted.  I went ahead and prepped and started my roast Chicken and Vegetables cooking before I went to the closet.  I told myself I'd work two hours and if it wasn't sorted by then, I could quit.  It took me 1 hour and 59 minutes.   I am pleased though.  The wire cube unit was put back together and is sturdy and level.  John determined that the floor appears to be uneven in that cubby and it probably had been throwing the whole thing off balance causing it to rock its way apart.  He's satisfied that it's now solid as it will be.I reorganized the whole unit.  I finally made myself give up a pair of someday shoes that I've held on to for years and have worn exactly twice in all that time.  I organized the clothes that I have hanging and sorted those.  The ones that don't fit due to their shrinking (2 tops) or my outgrowing them (we won't count) or which I can wear but don't because they are itchy/fit awkwardly, etc. are out of the closet and in the second pile of stuff to be donated.I even vacuumed the part of the floor that is visible and moved out a few items to go into the newly sorted guest room closet.  Whew!What I didn't do was fill the new bins I'd purchased for the bathroom.  However, I have almost filled the new kitchen trash can.  So, there's that, lol.Goodness that chicken smells good.  I hope it gets done soon.Friday:  What a joy to hear that little boy call out \"I'm here!\" when he arrived this morning.  He pulled every single one of his trucks and cars from the room and now has them lined up in the living room.  At present, I've sent him outdoors to play.  Is it quiet time?  It is.  But the morning was so cold that he had no option really but to have quiet time all morning long.  I'm going to let him enjoy the fresh outdoor air, which will no doubt do him a world of good, this afternoon.I have done my Friday housekeeping, including baking a loaf of bread.  I've also taken time to lay out all the necessary ingredients to make tonight's supper and have prepared the salad.  I'll probably add some shredded carrots and some finely sliced red cabbage for extra nutrition before I serve the salad.  I had a few minutes to myself this morning which allowed me to fill the bins I'd purchased and now the bathroom storage looks neat as a pin.  I'd like to get some lidded bins, something that looks decorative to hold the stuff in milk crates or cardboard boxes on the floor, but this made a nice start.Our week is pretty much done, except finishing off this day with Caleb.  I have no desire to work on any of the porches at present and none to do anything more this week, either.  It's been a good week, a busy week, and I have worked hard.  I'm going to enjoy this bit of time to relax because next week is coming and I can only imagine that it too shall be filled to the brim with more work, fresh projects, more organization and decluttering and getting things in shape for this brand-new year.  Amazon Associate Affiliate Link:  I earn a small commission if you shop through my amazon

{"title": "Thrifty Thursday Returns: Week 1 ", "date": null, "text": "Saturday:  I packed snacks for the drive down to the coast, but we were both hungry as could be one hour into our journey.  John opted to go through the drive-thru at McDonald's which provided us with a reasonably priced hot meal.  I provided the fruit we ate after that meal.  We were pleased to find our son had cooked a meal for us to eat upon our arrival.  This is unprecedented.  His meal was simple and basic and quite good.  He is not a cook.  He apparently polled his sisters and brother to determine what was within his scope.  At the hotel we indulged in a second cup of coffee (John) and a nice cup of cocoa for me.  Both were complimentary items.Sunday:  We opted to eat from the Continental breakfast provided by the hotel.  Gone are the days of bread and coffee.  They offered a full range of items, from fresh fruit to hot entrees.  There's a great range of choices for everyone.  This too is a complimentary thing the hotel provides.  We stopped at a small-town Dairy Queen that is about halfway between the coast and home.   The $5 meal deal is now $7 but still a good value.  We ate more fruit that I'd brought from home to finish off the meal.I think for the entire trip we spent something like $30 for food.  I consider that a pretty decent sum for two hot meals.  We were hungry, the food was all good and hot and I think worth every penny we paid for it.When we got home today, I took an entree frozen back in May of this year (2023) and put it in the oven to reheat.  I made a salad, opened a can of peas and sliced bread.  It was easy and filled our desire for real fresh foods.  I found that the paint I wanted to use to paint my curtain rod for the bathroom won't work on metal.  Phooey.  Then I remembered I had a gift card from October purchases made through my affiliate link on Amazon.  I bought both a curtain rod of the right size (with a spare one to set aside) and a new trash can for the bathroom with no money out of pocket.  Monday:  The children refused my offers of food today and all asked for peanut butter sandwiches. I said \"OK\".  I was going to be out of bread once the kids had their sandwiches, so I made up a quick roll dough for buns and then started bread dough in the bread machine, too.  Our rolls were ready in time for us to eat lunch.I had taken out a half pound of ground beef to make tacos, but they said they were having tacos for supper.  I cooked the meat with a bit of onion and ketchup for a quick take on Sloppy Joe.  I sorted out the pile of stuff in the guest bedroom and decided what to donate and what to keep.  Turns out the donate pile grew and grew.  I used the very last of my cabbage today making creamed cabbage to go with our supper tonight.  I didn't think it was enough for two, but it was just enough.Tuesday:  I emptied the canisters I wanted to give away and used jars I had on hand to hold the flour, sugar and such that needed to be contained.  I made my first change of the kitchen cabinets today. I realized that my original plan for the baking supplies was faulty, so I moved them to the space where I plan to have my baking center.  Ideally, I'd have my bread machine in the same area but at present, I have no place to put it except on the counter.  I'd continue to tweak things until I'm satisfied with how the kitchen works.  We stopped at the grocery to pick up lunch which was silly.  But we did.  And that meant I suddenly had a short list in mind which grew after looking at the ad.  I'm not going to fuss too hard at myself.  I spent about $69 today, but other than sandwich meats and cheese, and cat food, the bulk of it went into the pantry not to be used this month but next month or a further in the future.  Nearly everything we bought was a buy one get one free item so there was some substantial savings involved today, despite the spending.  There was also a short list of things I knew I needed and didn't even pick up.  We were at that pricey grocery which John loves shopping at so well and I am going to try to avoid, because it's pricey on so many basic items.We made lunch at home using some of the deli purchased bologna, canned tomato soup from the pantry and mandarins we'd bought today.  Supper we kept very simple: Toast and eggs.  It was enough after out late lunch.I noted as I put the chicken I'd thawed to roast into the fridge, that I have some cubed steak that I need to cook. I'd taken it out and put in the fridge to thaw before we left home on Saturday.  I'll make sure to use that tomorrow.Wednesday:  It's cold here.  So cold that at 2am this morning I lay awake listening to the heat pump run and run and run.  At 3am I got out of bed, opened doors on the sink cabinets in the kitchen and bath, put water to heat on the stove to add moisture to the air, then turned the propane heat on low.  I also added a blanket to our bed.  The moment I got warm once more, I went right back to sleep and slept well.  I think I actually woke because I wasn't quite warm enough.Having been busy all morning long, I scrambled to come up with lunch when I realized I was well and truly hungry.  I took two leftovers and combined them into something that resembled a dish Mama used to make now and then: Baked Beans and leftover Hamburger Scramble were combined.  Mama used Pork and Beans in her dish, but it's a use what you have life this month.  I'm just happy to find that what I had ended up tasting so very good.  I'm beginning to think this week's thrift will be a listing of meals only...Ho hum.  However, I shall share that what I made for each meal in part to show how I've chosen to use up items in an effort to have no waste.Supper: Cubed Venison Steak, Gravy, Mashed Potatoes, Collard Greens (canned) and finished it off by making a rice pudding from the leftover rice from Monday.  John was very pleased over the rice pudding.  I don't think I've made it even once since 2015 when I was diagnosed with diabetes.  It was lovely and delicious.  I cut down on my serving of potatoes and had a smaller portion of the pudding to balance things out.  This evening, I went online to Target to order the bins I wanted for the bathroom and then thought, \"Might as well look at trash cans.\" I had grand ideas...Ha.  I just don't see my paying over $100 for a trash can of all things, so I ended up with the usual plastic type, but it does have a flip lid on it.  While on the site I noted that they had a gift card with purchase for household items so I ordered trash bags and toilet paper both of which we will most certainly use in the year ahead.  I was going to have to get toilet paper within the next week or so anyway.  Might as well get something back.  I opted for store pick-up.  We're going to Warner Robins tomorrow to return those Amazon items to UPS.  Target is about 5 miles from that store, so I'll save postage by running over there while we're in town.I went ahead and looked up how to go about returning a pair of pajamas I'd meant to give Josh that were too small for him.  I've now got that bar code in my phone so I can return them while I'm picking up my order tomorrow.  I'll get that small amount of money back as well.  That will count towards my 'in pocket' funds since I used a gift card to pay for them.Thursday:  We headed out this morning and took the packages to UPS.  I'm waiting to hear from Amazon that it's been scanned.  That will put $42 or so back in my account.Then over to Target to both return and pick up.  I got my $15 gift card for spending $50 on household items (toilet paper and trash bags), the new trash can with flip top lid, and the bins I wanted to organize the shelves in the bathroom in a nicer way.When I made the return part of it was refunded to my credit card ($17) and the rest was put on a gift card.  I've no clue why, other than I paid for this partially with a gift card. ($6.90).  So I'm counting the 'in my pocket' portion of today's Target transaction as $21.90.  Those cards are tucked away for a rainy day.I asked John to go by Kroger after Target since it was on our way out.  Here I picked up produce: spinach, navel oranges, red onions, broccoli, cabbage, romaine and bananas; meat: kielbasa and andouille sausage, turkey pepperoni, and hot dogs for the kids when they are visiting (everything on sale); dairy: cheese bars, shredded Mozzarella, lactose free milk, milk, half and half.    My purchases netted me $4 in my pocket for picking up $20 in produce.  I spent $81 total, rounding me up to $150 total paid out for groceries this week.  The dairy and produce will likely be used this month, but the meats will be saved for future use.  Fingers crossed...I really hope that these are all the necessities required for our use for at least 2 more weeks.We came home and made lunch here.I have a whole chicken thawed in the fridge that I plan to put into the oven with a load of root vegetables.  I have sweet potato, onion, carrot, potatoes.  I'll serve this with a salad and bread and some of the rice pudding for dessert.Was this week frugal?  A trip away from home, meals out, extra gasoline, late fees (possible) on bills, and groceries?  I don't think it was, but I've tried hard to balance expenses with savings wherever I could.  John and I put $100 each from Christmas gift money into an envelope for a future vacation.  The trip will be partly covered by a gift from a reader. I do still have some of last month's allowance in my purse (about $35) so I'm not feeling too unbalanced, despite it all.How was your frugal week?  Did you make anything especially tasty and inexpensive?  Did you join in the pantry challenge with me?  Did you find any bargains too good to pass by or set money aside?  Come share with us!P. S. I loved the comments about the SOS/Hamburger Gravy.  Peggy S. had a great idea to use up any leftovers by spreading on a bun, then topping with cheese and running under the broiler.  That sounds really good.  And then Donna mentioned that her mom added carrot slices and served it over mashed potatoes.That made me think of how I made pasties a few times.  With the same ground meat, onion, gravy and cubed diced potatoes cooked together.  I made a pie crust dough and cut into rounds; then put a bit of the meat/veg mixture on the pastry round, seal edges with a fork and bake until pastry is done.   These are really good, too!Amazon Associate Affiliate Link:  I may earn a small commission on items you purchase using my Associate Link.  Thank you!"},
{"title": "The Ever-Changing Food Budget and Going Back to Basic Meals", "date": null, "text": "While I was on Christmas break, I happened to go through and scan some posts from January's past here on the blog.  That's when I came across the series written in 2017, Mother Hubbard's Cupboard.  My intent at the time was to show how people might eat on a very strict monetary budget.   My idea had been that if you did not have a pantry and no money to start one, you would still want to eat.  And if it happened that you were in financial straits, you might well have little money to eat upon.  So, I attempted to show how I could feed two people three meals a day for a small amount of money for one week.  We actually bought and ate those very foods for that one week.Then I took the leftovers and a steadily increasing but small budget and showed how in a matter of four weeks I'd built a supply of basic goods.  Not a deep storage pantry but enough that we could feed ourselves a little better diet even on a very modest sum.Now, in December 2023, as I was reading through the food list from that post, I was shocked as could be at the prices I quoted. These were the real prices I had paid at that time from the groceries where we typically shopped.  49c for a 4 ounce can of mushrooms, when my last pricing of them in November was well over $2.50 for the same size can. 59c a dozen for eggs...Last I bought at the current 'low' prices were $1.65/dozen. Oatmeal wasn't in my budget at that time, although it was still relatively cheap.  This week, the cost of a small box of name brand oatmeal was $3.99.2020 happened with all the shortages and such. In 2020, I never expected that some of the huge price increases back then would now be my 'set point' price in some instances and some of them would be much wished for prices to see once more!  Especially when it comes to meat.  At one point in my life, I never bought meat that cost more than $1 a pound. And I stretched that one pound of meat to feed 7 people every single night.  Now I feel blessed beyond measure to find meat for $5 a pound.  On the rare occasion when I find meat for less than that, I say prayers of thanksgiving and I'm not being in the least facetious.  2020 made me aware of two things.  First, that not everyone had the ability to shop just wherever they chose in order to chase down the lowest prices.  Second that where I'd always been careful in my kitchen, I still wasted a good bit of food.  That led me to try two experiments: to shop only at the local stores on occasion and see how well I might do on a limited budget in those stores, and to eliminate as much food waste as I could in my home.   Both of those experiments were eye-opening.  Here in the last year alone, I've watched prices continue to go up and up.  I hear stories from others stating much the same.  Everyone I know is scratching their head and pulling the strings of their thinking caps tighter and tighter in an effort to navigate the current environment of increased food costs.  Some have the ability to buy equipment to preserve more.  Some have the ability to garden more.  Some are becoming what my grandparents used to call a 'working farm' living on a few acres, keeping a cow and chickens and growing and foraging for foods and preserving it all.  Some of us are just trying to figure out how we're going to manage on what we have with very limited abilities and resources.I follow The Prudent Homemaker, as do most of you.  She has said that her price book is useless to her these days.  I believe that.  Once upon a time I knew prices fairly well.  I honestly have no idea what a good price is anymore from week to week.  Each week I read through four different ads and it's only by going through them that I know what a 'good price' is based on what is on sale in a given week or two weeks ago.  It's making food shopping more and more of a challenge.  More and more often the bulk of my shopping list is what I call a 'wish list'.  It's a listing of all the things I consider a good buy.  Then when my lists are made, I start striking off items, one by one until I determine what it is I truly need to buy and what I simply can't.I'm pretty sure that we are all in the same boat.  I think it's going to make 2024 an interesting year where our grocery budgets are concerned.  I've got a few ideas about how to help us all.  I'd like to explore some vintage recipes which are frugal and my thoughts about them as I employ them for our home use.  I'd like to share some tips as I cook, shop, substitute, and more. Truth, I've forgotten some of what I used to know, and I want to retrain myself to be mindful of those saving ways I had once upon a time.  In some instances, I want to get back to basics and use the good old simple recipes as a jumping off point for other meals.   I hope that you will enjoy this series which I'll sprinkle throughout the year ahead.   And I hope that if you are so inspired that you too will share old tips and new, recipes that you once used and more.As an example, I'll share what prompted this thought process: SOS, or Hamburger Gravy.  John and I wanted something for supper the other day, but we didn't want a big meal. I had about half a pound of ground beef and simply did not want to make burgers, though that would make John plenty happy.  I decided to make Hamburger Gravy which I served as Mama and Daddy used to do, over toasted bread.  I've always found it a sort of comforting meal.My recipe is basic and simple: ground beef (I have used venison as well), onion, salt and pepper, Worcestershire sauce, a bit of garlic or garlic powder, flour, and milk.  I mused over that meal as I prepared it.  Mama and Daddy made this dish when I was growing up.  Back then, they'd use a pound of ground beef to feed five.  When I was on a very tight budget and was broke as could be, I used a half pound of meat to feed 7.    Typically, this meal was always served over toast with green beans and mashed potatoes and some sort of salad on the side.  That's just the way Mama and Daddy did it.  I more or less just followed the pattern of childhood and did it the same way myself.As I stirred the meat that night, I thought of the ways I might stretch or change this meal for the least cost: More gravy, less meat is the most obvious way, as I did when John and I married, and we had a very tight budget.  If the budget were really tight, I'd use water and dry powdered milk to make the gravy and not whole milk.  Sometimes, when it milk was running low, both powdered and whole milk, then I'd use just plain water.I could take that same gravy and meat mixture and make other meals from it.   One of my favorite frozen entrees I have ever purchased from Sam's was a meat pie that was nothing in the world but Hamburger Gravy in a pie shell with Mashed Potatoes over the top, a sort of fancy cottage pie.  For this dish you would want the meat and gravy mixture thick enough to hold up the mashed potato topping.  Even with a pastry crust and potato topping, it's still a very economical meal. One morning this last winter, when I was having trouble finding sausage at a reasonable price, it occurred to me to serve Hamburger Gravy over biscuits for breakfast.  At the time I had plenty of venison on hand and it made for a hearty breakfast on some of those bitterly cold mornings.  It was a very inexpensive substitute for the pricier sausage.I could add a can of mushroom soup (or make your own cream of soup) with a bit of sour cream and serve as Hamburger stroganoff with egg noodles.  I'd suggest canned mushrooms but honestly you can buy fresh ones far less expensively than cans.  I might rehydrate some of the dried mushroom pieces I bought to toss in.   Or I might make Potato stroganoff by adding in thinly sliced potatoes (or dehydrated slices if you have those).  Thinning the gravy still more to ensure the potatoes cooked until tender.   I could skip the sour cream, add in chopped celery, and soy sauce and serve over rice for a rendition of that vintage Mock Chop Suey recipe I tried this last year.I could thin the gravy still more, perhaps adding in some bouillon for flavor, add in a few diced potatoes, a shredded carrot, and some shredded cheddar to make a Cheeseburger soup of this.  The cheese would be the big increase in cost for the dish, but it would be a nice change up and would stretch to feed several more people.As I said, I hope to have a few more posts of this sort as the year goes on, all based upon using what we have and keeping us aware of how versatile basic food items can be.Now I'm curious, what would you do with the same basic ingredients of browned ground meat, onion, flour, milk/water and seasonings?  Do you have a family favorite?  Have you made any of the dishes I mentioned above?Amazon Associate Affiliate Link:  I may earn a small commission if you use my link to shop Amazon.  Thank you!"},
{"title": "The Homemaker Plans Her Week: Sparkling New", "date": null, "text": "I hope you all enjoyed your holiday.  I bemoaned mine as you know but in looking back, I have more to be grateful for than to complain about.  Heartaches come all year long in all seasons, but they oughtn't to mar what was pleasant or sweet.  It just took a bit of rest to see clearly once more.   Not to say that I did nothing but rest.  Oh no indeed!  I had a week of time child free to move and clean and declutter and arrange and organize and I took full advantage of it.  It felt like the old days each time John said, \"Now sit down and rest a bit!\"  One day I paid the price of sore ankles from having been on my feet for so many hours the day before but oh what a lot of things I got accomplished!  I was so pleased with how things fell into place all around the house.  And aside from a huge, but neat, pile of things in the guest room, all the boxes are unpacked, and everything has a place.  New Year's Eve weekend, we made a flying trip south to Kingsland to visit with our oldest son and his children.  We came back the following day.  It's a decent journey of about five hours one way.  You'll understand when I say that New Year's Day was spent recovering!Now it's time to begin a New Year of work and projects.  Let's start out as we mean to go on, as Granny used to say to me.  Indeed!Work:  I'm excited to begin zone work once more for the year.  This month I'm switching things up.  Zone 1 for this week's focus area will be the Porches and Patio which is not at all where I typically begin the tasks of the month, but the porches were terribly neglected all through December and since the Kitchen is still 'new' and where I focused a world of energy these past two weeks, I think it would be nice to get the outdoors up to par as well.That huge pile of stuff in the guest room?  I need to sort it out into donate and keep and then move all the keep stuff out to the shed.  I'll just go on and load up the donation pile.  At some point this week I need to go by the UPS store to return two items from Amazon.  And let me just share with you what I did a few months ago.  I ordered printer ink, the wrong printer ink. I opened the multi-pack before I realized it was the wrong ink.  However, I still had the black ink unopened.  Just on a whim, though I'd had it for two or three months, I went and looked up the return window on that item and it was still within the parameters of their return policy.  That's $40 I can happily use and not a bad way to begin a New Year of savings!While I'm at UPS, I'll just go across the street to drop off the donations.I have a lamp in my living room that could use a new coat of paint, if weather/humidity allows. And if I can I'll paint a curtain rod to go into our bathroom.  After pricing them and seeing the same thing, I have for $22 for that small window, I figure I might just as well paint what I have and call it good.I have a few items on a mental list that I need to shop for...Well that never works for me!  When I am out shopping, that mental list is blank...Then I get home and remember it all.  So, I want to create a physical list so that when I am out I can shop for what we really need.I'll have Caleb from Wednesday through Friday.  And at some point, I plan to have the three from across the field for the bulk of a day as well.Kitchen:Starting my pantry/freezer challenge this week. I'd like very much to bake something this week.  I won't go all out with a fancy cake, but it would be nice to bake once again.   I'll also be making bread, burger buns, and some muffins to go into the freezer for easy breakfasts in days ahead.I want to clean out the freezer.  I have a load of stuff in both freezers and some of it is just...well it needs to leave.  I'm not using it, haven't considered using it, and frankly would rather have empty space to fill with stuff we will use.  And while I'm at it, there might be something I want to use in my Pantry Freezer Challenge. By the way, the perennial soup is done.  We polished that off on Friday when the temperatures plummeted and one of the workmen showed up to work on the storage closet in the bathroom.  He was half frozen by the time we had lunch and that soup and cornbread hit the spot.  That said, I wouldn't mind starting another batch of soup to freeze.Meals:We were out of town this weekend, so no cooking and no leftovers to use up.  I'm starting fresh as of Monday so one of the below meals will have been eaten already.Pork Chops, Rice, Black eye Peas, Cornbread  My New Year's Day menu or so I think...Since we spent the weekend eating quick meals on the go it's unlikely John will protest and send me off to get takeout so perhaps I can have my old traditional meal once more.  Salisbury Steak, Mashed Potatoes, Green Beans, Pear SaladTaco Pasta, Corn, Salad, PineappleRoast Chicken with roasted Root Vegetables, Waldorf Salad, RollsChicken Pot Pie, Slaw, Cranberry SaucePersonal/Leisure:Gather a stack of books to read my way through this month.Set up wardrobe for the month.Get back into the 'spa day' routine.  I feel so much nicer when I take time to pamper my skin, shave, do manicure and pedicure, etc.Get a haircut.Journal, color, play good music and above all else read my daily Scriptures!Give myself the care I need in order to care for others.  We've a lot of 'stuff' happening in the family at the moment, some good, some not and it's looking like a season ahead where I am stretched to give and do more in a different quarter of my family."},

My grocery bill was slightly lower only because I didn't take the time to shop and with good sales on baking items pretty much non-existent here in my area, there was no real stocking up.   It made sticking to the grocery budget easy enough.   So why am I doing a pantry challenge for January if things are in decent shape?"},

We could refer to all the components of personal and family preparedness, not in relation to holocaust or disaster, but in cultivating a life-style that is on a day-to-day basis its own reward.\" (President Spencer W. Kimball) from Becky's Monday Message on Frugal Measures blog.Start Where You Are.I was reading Patsi's blog, A Working Pantry, the other day and she wrote a post worth reading.  She ends her passage with these words, \"There is always going to be someone who can do more than you, accept it and move on doing what you can with what's in your hands.\"Having myself fallen into the current trend of following homesteaders who do ALL the things and seem to do it with money to spare, I have felt the sense of frustration and yes, helplessness, as I look at our own financial situation and the constraints we have upon our time in our home and realize that I CANNOT do all the things.   I know how satisfying it is to look at homesteader cellars full of canned goods and to hear of freezers packed with various items, and the gardens that produce enough to feed them for a year and listen to others share about bug out kits and long-term food storage. But remind yourself of one thing before you toss up your hands and say, \"I'll never be able to get there...\"You can only start at the beginning.  The beginning is where you are right now.If the beginning looks like you've got enough food to last the week, then that's where you start.  If the beginning looks like enough food to last perhaps a month, then that's where you start.  If the beginning looks like a home with small children and not nearly enough hours in the day, then that's where you start.  If the beginning looks like retirement and limited income and less of that than you'd thought you might have, then that's where you start. You can't begin anywhere else except for where you are!Let's talk about building up a pantry that can feed you for a month, three months, six months, a year and start right where you are.This is where I am: I live on a little less than ten acres, and about 3 of it are clear of trees and underbrush.  I have no special equipment with which to till up a garden or even create a flower bed.  I am, at present, 64, and supposedly retired.  I am helping to raise a soon to be 4-year-old boy.  My husband and I share our home with this little boy and his mom.  I currently make a few things from scratch, but I could do more, and I know it.  However, I have to take into account the time factor because of the little boy.  He needs time and attention, too.I have only had a proper garden once in my life.  It was hugely successful but that was ages upon ages ago and not here on this property. My current 'garden' consists of lots of pots and two raised beds and a tiered planter full of mostly herbs.  To date, I have harvested 15 tomatoes, a handful of herbs, and currently have carrots and beans and snow peas that were flourishing but not yet ready to produce.  We're about to have our first frosts of the year.  So the dreams of those plants providing us with a thing are done.In my youth, I often canned items, but I haven't done that in years..  I have only recently acquired an electric pressure canner and had gotten a hot water bath canner just a couple of years before.  I don't do a lot of canning at present.  I make jelly and apple butter. I bake bread and cook from scratch.  Over the years, I have built up a pantry, but it's taken time and sacrifice to do it.  My 'pantry' is a makeshift area.  I took over the walk-in closet of one of my bedrooms when my daughter left home and turned it into a pantry area with shelving and bins.  Now my daughter and grandson use that room as a bedroom and the closet needed for their clothing has been an old Chiffarobe and a spare bookcase.I have passable sewing skills.  I've upholstered furnishings.  I've learned to use paint and ingenuity to transform things.  Over the years, I have learned new skills that have allowed me to do more.  Currently I am attempting to cultivate food.  Following 2020, I determined that I could do better in being prepared for medical needs.  John, being a paramedic, feels we have what is required for an emergency that might affect wound care.  We don't have a full-blown pharmacy, but we have enough to see us and another family member or two through an onslaught of colds and minor accidents.I've been trying to make my home more friendly for our elderly years.  We've had our back deck turned into a back porch with low broad steps at one end on which we might easily place a ramp if needed.  We've removed the upper cabinets in our kitchen and are just about to get the kitchen renovated with new lower cabinets in the coming weeks.   We're replacing a deep awkward tub in our master bathroom with a walk-in shower that will be large enough to accommodate a shower chair.  We don't anticipate needing a ramp or shower chair right away, but the porch and altered bath and kitchen will be just as useful to us now as it will be in the days ahead.  I want to be able to stay in my home long term. If I were to tell you I'm starting today, this is the place from which I would start my journey.  This would be MY beginning.  You can't start from this place unless you have had the exact same experience and the exact same materials I have right now to work with.  I do have ideals.  One of my ideals is that I would be able to raise a majority of the produce we'd typically eat.  Because of where I live, I think it would be possible to grow something we might eat fresh year-round.  I'd like to have a few chickens.  I'd love to support local meat producers.  I'd like to be able to can and freeze foods all year round.  I'd like to be less dependent upon the grocery store and more able to buy in bulk those items that we must purchase from the store.  I'd like to make still more items from scratch than I do now.  That means working harder.  And smarter.I'd like to be better prepared for emergencies such as long power outages.  We've survived admirably well for a week several times without electricity in the aftermath of severe weather situations and I've learned a few things because of that, including what we'd need to do it better.  The last such outage saw me lose a considerable amount of food from our freezer.  I was lucky that my freezer was very nearly full so larger bulkier items were saved.My ideal includes continuing to improve our home and property.  I want flowers as near all year round as I can manage.  I would love to have a prettily landscaped yard.  It's not important for preparedness but it is important to me because that's the sort of person I am.  I need to be surrounded by beauty. I would like to replace lesser quality furniture with better quality items that will see us through the end of our years.This is my beginning.  In the week ahead we're going to look at how to build a pantry and where that pantry can be located.Amazon Associate Affiliate Link:  *I earn a small commission if you shop through my Amazon link."},

I'm curious if that was the original plan or if the house was altered at some point, because the front door opened directly into the living room, and it's been my experience with older homes of this sort that the front and back door generally were at either end of the wide central hallway."},

{"title": "The Homemaker Plans Her Week:  Back to Routine", "date": null, "text": "I'll be honest with you all.  If I'd known how last week was going to run, I'd have taken time to go over and visit Mama.  As it was, I was working on the idea that Katie and Caleb would return any day and the days stretched out to the full week.This week, we should be back to regular routines.  I'm just hopeful that we all settle right in without any adjustment issues.  I think Caleb is in a much better place than he was this time last year and unlikely to be as emotionally undone by his week away.  Or so I pray.Let me gather my thoughts and get to work planning my week.Work:  Zone 3 is Beds and Baths.  I just cleared up Katie and Caleb's room as best I could on Friday, so nothing much is required there.  I'd like to dust our bedroom this week, and once again clear my dresser of unnecessary clutter.  I can move the accumulation of seeds and seed packets to the basket in the laundry area where I store those items. Routine cleaning is all I need do to both bathrooms, but I do want to tackle my bathroom cabinets.  All are cluttered and crowded and there's excess in them that really is beginning to bug me no end.  I'm done with it.  I think I can rearrange the top cabinet which we use as medicine storage in a better way.   The towels need to be sorted and folded neatly and stored away.  The bottom cupboard of that three-tiered cabinet is filled paint cans, paint brushes, painting stuff.  I need to get rid of the almost empty cans and the shot paintbrushes, etc.  It just needs to be done.And if I have time aside from my other household duties this week, I want to see if I can arrange the kitchen island cabinets in a better way.  It's simply not working for me.  I find myself frustrated too often.  I suspect I can declutter a few more items that will net me enough room for all I want to have out at present.I don't think we have any appointments or other plans this week.  Just all the routine things which is enough.Kitchen:I never baked a thing last week.  I have the same list I had last week: either apple pies or carrot cake.  I'll add bagels this week since John will likely have polished them off this weekend (typing this out on Friday afternoon).And since I don't know if I'll get to the grocery (no plans at present), I'll likely make up some fancy muffins for my weekend breakfast.   By fancy, I mean with streusel topping and all that sort of thing. I think some apple muffins would be nice.  Or perhaps that lovely Mennonite Cinnamon Quick Bread that I keep promising myself...Oh plans!Meals:I made out a whole list of foods I was craving in August, just waiting for cooler weather.  I think I've made every one of them.  I would like to make another 'wish list' of entrees I would like to make now the weather is cooler.???To each their own???Gramma's Fried Chicken, Mac n Cheese, Cauliflower and Broccoli CasseroleMeatloaf, Italian Peasant Vegetables, Biscuits.  I have a listing on Pinterest of six of seven meatloaf recipes.  I'm going to choose one of those to try, not sure just yet which one.  Chicken Cobbler, Peach Salad.   Tiktok Red Lobster Cheddar Bay Biscuit dough tops this cobbler.  I kept thinking I needed to cook chicken for this meal, but I'm pretty sure I have a packet of chicken pot pie filling in the freezer I can use, which will cut down on the pre-prep cooking.I feel like I need to add to this menu...just not sure what I'd add.  Perhaps some type of extra vegetable, perhaps Butter Beans? I'll see what I have in the freezer.Chili, Rice, Salad, CornbreadHam with Pineapple, Au Gratin Potatoes, English Peas, Rolls.  We have the ham and pineapple already in the freezer, saved from a previous meal.  I've got boxed au Gratin potatoes.  All of this with an eye towards keeping the meal as simple as I can since I should have Millie at least a good part of the day.  The rolls I'll make up fresh.We go out for a meeting.  Katie and Caleb will likely go visit her friend, so something leftover or something snacky.Personal/Leisure:I've recently added dry brushing to my shower routine.  I'd done it in the past, but my brush broke, and I never picked up another until very recently.  So, I'm back at it.  It's supposed to be very beneficial to skin and the lymphatic system both.  I like that this is a natural system stimulant that doesn't require more pills/minerals, etc.Amazon Associate Affiliate Link:  This week I want to take time to go out and BUY the ingredients to make the homemade heavy duty moisturizing lotion for my skin.  With cooler weather coming in, the heater running here and there, I know that my skin will be dry.  I noticed this last year and this year I mean to be proactive with it.I'm also going to look into Intermittent Fasting.  Do you know my greatest problem with it thus far has not been the process but the way the people who employ it have become nearly fanatical about it.  I don't want to be fanatical. I do want to lose weight and from all I understand this is a healthy approach, one that my doctor has mentioned to me in the past as something worth trying as well as being a good way to help control blood sugar overall.   John's admonished me to make sure I don't 'crap out' as it refers to my blood sugar drops, and I agree.  I want to work with this slowly and determine how this will work for me.What I like about this method of eating is that it doesn't rely on cutting out food groups, nor in limiting oneself in a stringent manner.  Most of the people who do intermittent fasting still eat dessert, have bread and butter, put cream in their coffee, etc.  They just have chosen to eat during a constricted time frame, not assume a constricted diet.Just so you know, it's not just for losing weight either.  If you are one of those people who are very thin, who tend to lose weight to dangerous levels from even slight illness, intermittent fasting and higher protein/higher calorie eating (GOOD fats and nutrition not junk) can be employed with the intermittent fasting to increase weight healthily.  Honestly, I need to step up self-care in so many areas.  I'd like to do light makeup most days and get back into that habit.  I want to be more consistent with my mani- and pedicures.  I have terribly dry cuticles, especially my fingers and they look ragged and torn half the time.  It takes moments to moisturize properly, but I rarely take time.   Ditto for all my skin care needs.  Push myself to be more consistent with reading the Bible.  Work harder at getting those three 'Morning Pages' written each morning.  I'm thinking perhaps I should be rising just a little earlier than what I do.  My excuse has always been that I don't sleep well so many nights that I 'deserve' the extra sleep.  However, I have noted that I do tend to fall asleep more easily when I rise earlier.  It would also give me a window of time to read the Bible, work on those Morning Pages and get ready for my day.  No rule says I have to exit my room earlier, just get up a little earlier.Wardrobe...Why I keep putting this off I've no idea.  I need to just do it! After typing this out, I took into consideration my calendar for the next two weeks.  I need 7 outfits.  I then went off to the closet and set up 7 outfits, some of which have layers that can be easily removed and still have a cohesive looking outfit if it happens to be warmer than I'm anticipating. Mark this one DONE!"},

Whether or not I make a trip for fresh apples, I can do this.  Granny used her homemade biscuit dough rolled thin, and cooked fresh or dried apples.  I used to make these and bake them instead of frying.  They are both good.  But again, it's nostalgia I'm going for.  She fried them in butter.  They were delicious.  I won't do a big batch.  I'll make just enough for one for everyone and that will be perfect.Drive up to the foothills to see fall color.  I suspect it will be a little more towards the end of the month for that.  Usually, our deepest colors come after frost in November, but every now and then we get to see color prior to that.Also later in the month:  I've promised Caleb we'll get a BIG pumpkin and carve it.  I'll probably not put it on the porch but have it here in the house on the table and we'll put a battery powered light in it so he can have the joy of seeing it lit up.  I want to make up Halloween treat bags for all six of the children.  I'd like to include non-edible things, but I'll have to see what I can find that's inexpensive.  And then I think it would also be fun to include some candy from mine and John's childhood, something from their parents' childhood and something that is their personal favorite.  Look out for flowering kale and snapdragons at the garden centers.  Plant them for winter color.  In the past they have done so beautifully here even in frosty weather.I want to do a fall manicure.  There's one online that I've seen a lot with a golden yellow color, russet, brown, an olive green and some orange color.  Can't find the image just now, but I think they are so pretty.  I have all but the golden yellow color.  Something like this:I have all of these colors but not the golden color.  This isn't the exact one I had in mind, but it's similar.  There are other possibilities, too.  Look them up on Pinterest under Fall inspired manicures.I found this one that might work.  Amazon Affiliate Associate Link:This one might work...I've got it ordered.Set up a month of outfits if I can.  I don't have that many clothes, but if I put the shared bottom with the multiples of tops and the necklace or scarf that can go with it that particular outfit, I can set up close to a month's worth, I think.   I'll have fun trying anyway, especially since I'm going to pretend it's really going to turn autumnal and I can wear my sweaters, lol.The peach sheds near us often start to sell pecans and butter pecan ice cream this time of year.  I'll try to convince John to go but if he backs out on me, I'll see if I can't do this with Mama one day.I've made up my mind: from this month forward I'm going to try and keep something fresh in the house in each season.  Right now, we have pumpkins and winter squashes meant for eating, tucked into the old wooden dough board.  I'll see if the big pine tree has dropped pinecones which I could add in.  And in the weeks ahead I'll have sprays of persimmon or pyracantha in the blue and white jars or colorful leaves, etc.  I'm not against buying these things either if I can't find them in the wild.  I just want to have something pretty on display in each month of the year.I know it's not really cold yet...but I'd love to find some pretty throws to go on my chairs.  Not the thin little fleece type ones be had for $2 at Dollar General, but lush knits or velvety ones.  I know they will cost a pretty penny.  Don't care.  I can buy one this year and another next year...I want to find some pretty bowls to go with my dinner set.  I know what I'd like to have.  I'll look around on Ebay and see if I can't find some that are affordable.Read.  I know some of Emilie Loring books are set in the autumn, Diary of An Edwardian Lady is set up by month, again some of Glady's Taber's books, Frugal Luxuries...and I'm just willing to bet I can find a Grace Livingston Hill that is set in autumn.  I only have about 50 to choose from!I'm going to make up my own little blend for my evening cup of decaf coffee.   I have plenty of spices and I am pretty sure I can come up with something lovely that will give me the aroma and taste I want for an autumn cuppa.And since the evenings are getting cooler, I'm going to try to slip out to watch the sunset while I have that evening cup and count the blessings from my day while I'm there.  Make autumn leaf shaped sugar cookies. I think I need to replace my sugar sprinkles but this has become something I so enjoy doing.And that's my list for this month."},
{"title": "October Goals: Work, Work, Work", "date": null, "text": "I've just read over September goals and boy...I thought I was doing so well!  Did I over plan?  Perhaps in some ways.  Looking back, I know I did accomplish many things, just now all of the things I'd hoped to accomplish.  I confess I'm a mite disappointed in myself at this moment.  It's a good time to read through that post and remind myself to not be quite so terribly ambitious with this month's goals.Spiritual:  No on Bible study last month, so so on prayer.What will it take to make this a habit once more?  Years ago, I started reading the Bible daily and I very, very rarely missed a day.  Then when I started keeping Caleb full time this year, I let it lapse and here we are, a non-reader.  Since a full-on Bible study seems to be beyond me and my mind, I'm going to go back to basics.  This month, I'm going to try to read a chapter a day.  I'll go back to Roman's and start where I left off in August.  I know that eventually I'll have the time to do a proper study, but it seems to me that reading alone is better than good intentions and doing nothing.I did get better at journaling daily and some of those days turned into a written conversation with God which was nice.  I hadn't expected that my journal might become part of my daily spiritual practice.  Since it did, I'll add here that I hope to write daily.Outdoors:  I didn't get the broken rocker off the back porch, no encourage John in looking to see if there's any way possible to fix it.  I'm thinking maybe two small 'L' brackets might do it.  We'll see.  I might even attempt it myself.I did get the excess things off the back porch and then came back to find the headboard sitting there...I'll get that to the shed this month, heck this week.The front porch needs a hard cleaning and by hard, I mean it needs a good hard scrubbing.  Since I've just about got my shoulder where it's not super painful all of the time, I find I'm really reluctant to test it out.  I know from the past that I can do this in small sections and since I'm out there nearly every day, I'll attempt to do it in that manner first.  The patio table is still there on the patio and with the new playhouse, the water table, scooters and bike and the two wagons, and all the planters it's looking mighty crowded.  I can move something away and put it under the carport for now.  Speaking of which there is a table under the carport that needs to be removed as it's falling apart.  Mostly I leave the carport to John, but I put the table out there and I expect it will be up to me to remove it.The fall/winter garden has been planted and there are mums and pansies planted. I am still hoping to find snapdragons and Kale, but I haven't found any yet.  As we get nearer the end of the month, I want to plant garlic, and then I need to get the Mandevilla up out of the pot it's in and ready to go into the bin for the winter.  I'm hoping the Hibiscus will overwinter.  They're supposed to here in our area.Caleb:  Potty training goes on...We are getting outdoors every day just now, unless it's full-on raining.  This has been so beneficial to him.  He's afraid of every little thing, no kidding, but he's growing in confidence and being more independent out there as long as I'm standing by.Indoors, there are too many toys in the toybox and he either ignores them or dumps them all out in a search for something else.  I'm going to bag up a few things to send over to Katie's boyfriend's, so he has some of his own things there.  I won't overload that poor man with my cast offs.  Some I will simply put way in the shed and hold them until he needs something fresh to play with once more.  I find rotation helps.  How it is that we ended up with such a lot of stuff is beyond me, but we do.House:  I pulled out a 9 x 13 pan and the lids to my pots and lo and behold, my kitchen angst died.  Those were all the items I brought out...nope, I also brought out the 12-cup muffin pan after I found my cheap 6-cup one from the dollar store was rusting.  Those things have made a huge difference in how I feel in my kitchen.  This month is supposed to be the start of our renovations.  Will it be?  I honestly can't say.  I guess we just limp along until he shows up and then if he's not here when November starts, we try calling once again.  In the meantime, just all the cooking, cleaning, etc.The house is a bit better but there's a lot of backlogs of work to be done.  Getting back into Zone work has meant that something is being done in every area every month and that's something I plan to continue working with.I started a running list of things I am completely out of stock of in my pantry and this month I hope to fill those gaps with not only one for now but two for later in most things and case lot in the areas that are affordable as case lots.  We don't get special sales on those around here, but these are the canned items that aren't typically horribly expensive anyway.  Other things, like Maple Syrup and Spam, I'll work at over the next few months.Restock my supply of candles.  I only have one matching pair left to use in the candle holders on the table.  We typically burn them for Shabat but in the darker months, I've been known to light them at the supper table and on really dreary days even at lunch, just for the brightness they give.  Kids love it when I do that.We'll just leave that there. I tend to examine upcoming zones and know pretty much what I'll be working on when I hit that week.  Personal:  Continue with my plan to eat better. I did get into a couple pairs of pants this past month that had been too small to even consider zipping.  I'm not saying they aren't snug yet, but I'm able to close the zipper and button them.  That's progress.  So I plan to keep going with this and yes, I did this despite entering whole heartedly into baking fall treats this past month.I got my coat. And a pair of leopard ballet flats.  Right now, I need to step back and assess where I am and what I think I need before I buy anything else for my outer wardrobe. In October, I start to look for new bras, nighties, and underwear then I buy a few pieces each month, so that will be my direction starting this month.I'm trying to be mindful of my skin once more.  I do have some very rough looking skin on my arms and with winter coming in they will only look worse.  One of you reminded me of a formula I'd used in the past of baby oil, lotion and something.  I stopped using it because of the high scent of the products.  I realized the other night I could easily sub in the fractionated coconut oil, the unscented lotion I typically use...and seems like a third ingredient, perhaps Vaseline?  I'll have to look it up and see if I can't recreate this beauty balm for my skin from the products that have no scent.  Manis and pedis.  I didn't quite reach the point of doing it as often as I'd said, but I'm going to keep trying.  I did find a nice express dry topcoat that I can use to help extend the life of my polish.Finally, posture is being a bear for me lately.  My shoulder pain is very nearly gone.  What helped was sleeping with a rolled towel under my arm (about the armpit and upper breast area) which took some of the pressure off the shoulder at night...Of course, the chiropractor did a lot of work that brought the pain down to something bearable herself, so won't forget to mention that.   I realized that my posture while sitting in my chair was making my shoulders hurt, so I started to put a pillow behind me so that I could comfortably lean back upon it and lo and behold the remaining shoulder pain pretty well has decreased.  Then I found that sitting with my feet up as I like to do was doing a number on my legs.  I do need to elevate them some, but I was sitting too long with them up and I noted I was hobbling most when I did.  So, I started intermittently putting them up and after 20 minutes putting them down for 20 minutes.  Made a huge difference in my gait.Now to continue with these three things.  I need to make one more correction.  I need to use another pillow to elevate my laptop better, so I don't lean into it when I'm writing.  So that's my last goal in this area.Finances:  I don't think I announced this, but Maxine who comments here on posts often enough issued me an invitation to join her and her daughter in a financial challenge.  Our goal was to physically SAVE $125 this past month.  Maxine has done exceptionally well with her challenge.  I didn't do too shabbily either.  I started a whole brand-new savings account and put away about $250.  Right now, I'm trying to determine just what I think I'm going to earmark this money for.  I also cashed in Fetch rewards and put that into a restaurant gift card for us to use.  I'm setting the same goal this coming month: $125.  I also put aside nearly $400 towards the deficit in the home insurance amount to pay it off in full in November when that bill comes due.  That puts me ahead with that as well.I won't tell you these funds came from a reduction in our grocery spending.  I haven't even looked at those figures, but I'm going to.  This month, in order to encourage me to reduce that down to my previously budgeted level, I'm going to keep a running tab on my bulletin board so that it is IN MY FACE and reminds me that unless it's a super-duper unexpected sale I need to really stick to my budget, produce and dairy, or my running pantry list, which will be my primary goal when I do shop.  Keep a close eye on Amazon orders and make sure I'm still getting the best price.  Last month I got a shipment of two different lots of paper plates.  One had been unavailable for months.  I didn't get my August pre-order approval notice at all, so I had no idea I was getting a massive shipment of paper plates and being charged for both, which I ought to have been.  Not complaining over that.  Here's the deal, I can go in and see what's coming each month well ahead of time and catch these things if I'll just take the time to go look.  In the meantime, I've come across a smaller paper plate (going from 10 inches to 8.5) for one fourth the price.  John can be happy with two inches less paper plate for that sort of savings, or so I say.I need to work up a budget sheet for the last quarter of the year.  This is always a sticky sort of time as we have several annual renewals that we must have money set aside for, two major holidays, six birthdays and Christmas.   I've got Josie's three taken care of but there's plenty more grandchildren and children and a husband and mom and family otherwise on that list.Blogging:  Ugh.  This one I really didn't do as well in as I had planned.So back to square one: Try my best to remember to put up an Amazon Affiliate link in each post.  My June/July sales from this and the recipe blog netted me $14 in September from Amazon. I thank everyone who took the time to use those links.  It's a slow earning, but it's a help.  That $14 paid for a half case of Pizza sauce and ten boxes of tissues for the pantry. Again, I thank those of you who stopped to use them.  I doubt August nor September will do half so well since I took time off in August and then couldn't seem to remember to add in the Affiliate links.  I hinted I was going to start a new blog and I have posted a couple of the older edited and compiled pieces to a new one.  I'm just not ready to totally launch it yet.  It needs work.  When I do get it fully up, I'll be sure to monetize it as well with ads and Affiliate links.  Please understand that this is not an alternate to this blog.  It is my plan to direct traffic from public readings to the new blog so that they can read pieces they've heard and skip over all the frugal and daily life stuff.  I'm perfectly happy posting here and plan to continue to do so.I hope to get in a few more posts on this blog. I did fair this past month, but I'd like to be up to at least four posts a week and even five if I can swing it.  I can't make a hard commitment to that while I'm watching children.  I also need to 'prime' my inspirational pump.  It's run dry over the summer.  I'm working on that as well.And that's it for the main goals.  Keep an eye out.  I'm planning another post on Romancing October...I think you'll enjoy that one!Amazon Associate Affiliate Link:  Isn't this a  pretty planner?  And it's two years..."},

I'd also noted meat was getting low in the freezer and I wanted to check local prices against what was available via ads at the other stores.  I was really pleased overall.  I'm fairly sure of some prices at the other stores, like what Caleb's lactose free milk runs. It was a good bit higher, by almost $1 at the local store, but since I asked them to carry it, I do feel obligated to go in and pick up a half gallon now and then.  However, the cost was offset by the good prices I found on other items today, namely in the meat department."},

This book was published in 1924 and is the story of a college girl going home to take care of her family and family home.

When I do finally cry, it's usually an involuntary action after I have reached a point of extreme stress.  There are many times I 'suck it up', swallow back tears, refuse to let them go.  Well according to this psychologist crying is the natural reaction of a body to stress of all sorts, both good and bad.  And when you feel the need to weep, it's your body telling you that it is out of balance and needs to be fine-tuned."},

I'll probably end up doing the ham in the slow cooker and yes, leftovers will be sandwiches for the children tomorrow.Spaghetti, Garlic Bread, Salad.  I'll most likely get two or three meal sized portions of sauce from whatever I make.  I'll try to get the vegetables diced up on Wednesday, then dump all this in the slow cooker and let it go all day long.  I'll want an easy meal after having the children for the day.Chicken Wings, Fried Rice, Eggrolls.

I played amateur detective to try to figure out the first recipe. I looked up Tomato surprise and since the book was published in 1932, the chapter dealt with a heat wave, etc., I found a recipe that I felt might be the nearest to what they might have served here. Down in the comments on that post, the author adds more direction.Snow pudding was also a new to me recipe but there are loads of recipes online for that.  The ones I think most likely resemble what Mrs. Hill mentions contain gelatin, egg whites, sugar.  It appears that most are served with a custard sauce, usually lemon flavored, so you'd utilize the egg yolks as well.  I'd be curious to try both these recipes at least once.Lunch out with a co-worker: Soup, Rolls, Baked ApplesUnexpected Company invited to a family dinner: thin slices of ham, Baked Potatoes, Yellow Corn on the Cob, Bread and Butter, Cold Applesauce, and cold Milk.A picnic on the way to the shore: Sandwiches made with ground meat, grated onion, bits of pickles, and sweet pepper; also, sandwiches made with dates, cheese and nuts; Stuffed Eggs wrapped in lettuce leaves; Iced tea and cold milk in thermoses; Cherry tarts and tiny frosted sponge cakes; grapes and peaches.Upon arrival at the shore, it's noted that the refrigerator is filled with these items: stew, applesauce, tomato jelly, cold roast chicken.  The bread box contained cake, rolls and bread.  The postmaster apparently was in charge of general merchandise as well and sent over butter, eggs, and milk.1st supper at the shore: Beef Stew and rolls.Another supper at the shore: Clam Chowder, Cake, Sliced Peaches with cream and sugarScalloped Oysters, Roasted Potatoes, Stuffed Tomatoes, Chocolate bread pudding with real whipped cream to top it.Amazon Associate Affiliate Link"},

{"title": "The Homemaker Plans Her Week:  School Holidays", "date": null, "text": "In my home this week, we are sad.  We said goodbye to our sweet cat Misu.  She was Katie's cat and though, Katie tried to acclimatize her to living indoors, Misu refused to come in.  She was upset by just sitting inside with the door open between her and outdoors. This was just before Katie married and was moving into a city.  In the end, it was determined that I'd keep Misu and Katie would move without her.Misu didn't take to the 'new ownership' very well.  She didn't have any real affection for me at all for five or more years.  And then suddenly one year it all changed.  She was about 8 at that point and she started lavishing me with affection.  She brought me gifts (ick ones, but in cat terms the finest of gifts).  When she was upset, it was I who heard her complain the longest and loudest.Over the last few months, she'd stopped grooming herself.  I went out and patiently brushed her fur and wiped down her dirty feet.  Then she had a sore develop on her forehead.  I suspect she'd been bitten by something, perhaps a non-venomous snake or a rat.  It looked pretty bad because she would not allow me to put any medication on it but we kept a careful watch over her, and it finally scabbed over.  I noted yesterday morning that her legs were a mess, that they appeared to have some sort of rash and planned when we returned from our day to clean her up.   Sam stopped by to get something.  He flipped her over and noted that there was more damage than appeared to the eye.  Never mind that she'd eaten breakfast same as always, there was damage and while she seemed to be in no pain, it was serious enough that we knew this was the end.  We don't want any animal to suffer needlessly.  We made plans to put her down.  We all spent time loving on her and telling her how much we appreciated her sharing our lives, how exemplary a cat she'd always been.  Katie opted to be the one to carry out the procedure and buried her in a grave that John had carefully dug.  At some point we all cried, as well we might.  She was our cat for at least 15 years.  There was a family upset.  Easter weekend isn't going to happen as planned.  Easter weekend could be better on so many scores.  And we haven't even got to Easter day just yet. We do the best we can all around, but I admit I am drained emotionally and mentally just at the moment.  Taylor had Spring holidays last week.  The boys across the field will be out this coming week.  I hope I get to see the three from across the field soon, at least one day while they are out of school, and not just on Easter but we'll wait and see how that goes.  Too many raw feelings all over the place and too many under the surface things going on.  Work:Yesterday the weather was at nearly 90F.  Today, as I work on this post, it is 50F, rainy and cold.  Tomorrow, Easter Sunday is meant to be a little warmer and while not sunny, it's not meant to rain.   My family won't be joining us as planned, but I've gotten permission for the children to come for an egg hunt.  I plan to keep this day as simple as possible.  A Brunch meal and fresh fruit us all planned and prepped.  Tomorrow, Katie will devil eggs, I'll warm the meats and we'll bake Orange Danish.Monday through Thursday is meant to be fairly pleasant outside. I'm going to do my level best to get outdoors and attend to those flowerpots of mine.  I've done about all the weeding I can do and I haven't yet bought mulch so it's flowerpots and nothing but flowerpots.Zone 2 Living Room and Dining Room.  I want to wash the sheers and the pillow covers.   It's time, despite the present daytime temperatures, to wash the throw blankets and put them away.  I said I'd like to put a few things out that look like Spring.   I don't go over the top, but I have a few pretty pieces that have spring flowers on them, and I'd like to put them out.Put away most of the Easter things, few as those are.Declutter.  Donate or move to the shed.  I have at least three two cabinets to go through (Just went through one).  I know I can let go of some things.Katie spent the day rearranging her room and now I can easily get to the few things I need to still move from that room.  Katie sorted out her heavy winter things from her spring/summer clothing.  I want to go through the small bin and see if I have shorts or t-shirts for Caleb.  I have a feeling he's going to be in a growth spurt.  It's time to move some of his heavier things out as well.  I've got to do the same in my closet.  I need to find a spot to store sweaters.  I have a huge Ziplock packing bag (it has breathing vents) full of antique quilts that must be put somewhere safe.  And a handful of others that are not put away that must go somewhere...Honestly just right now, my brain boggles at finding places to put all the things...I can't think of any work that doesn't involve putting things away somewhere else and frankly it's a bit overwhelming to me at the moment as I struggle to assess and rearrange storage space that is already in a limited supply.   Mainly I want my home to not look like it's a storage facility at least on the surface!For the record, it's not about there being MORE in the house.  There isn't.  It's just that what was tolerable as a more temporary problem isn't tolerable when you're looking at a longer time period.  If I can clear some of the excess of my own things out, then I'll feel more comfortable overall.Call the doctor to verify an order that is confusing.I have a rosebush that is a knockout variety single yellow blossoming rose.  I've had it for years and years.  It stubbornly has grown from its former spot where it was originally planted next to the old back steps and is now underneath the newer back porch steps and grows through a section of the back porch and then up and out through the rosemary bush.  It's stubborn and has continued to grow there though repeatedly pruned and cut back, doused with killer (by John), etc.  The rose is pretty and has bloomed like nobody's business through all the efforts to kill it.  I admire its tenacity and quite like the bloom.  I'd like to try to root a couple of pieces and see if I might not get new rose bushes from it.  John has been talking of putting concrete steps at the end of the back porch and I know that when he does the yellow rose will most likely be finished. Kitchen:Honestly, if you all could look at what I say I want to accomplish each week on these posts and then compare it to what I didn't accomplish, you'd wonder if I'm even capable of doing a single thing!  I did NOT get a freezer inventory done last week.  I really need to do one.  I don't much know what I have in there aside from perhaps what's on one shelf and what I most recently purchased to go in (1 turkey breast, four pounds of ground turkey).Second thing on my list this week is prompted by Mandy in the Making.  A viewer question this week mentioned her own \"new\" instant pot that she'd now had for over two years and never had used.  She asked Mandy her suggestions for getting more comfortable with the appliance. I immediately paid attention because I've had mine since before Christmas and haven't touched it yet except to move it out of sight.  My own instant pot is also an electric pressure canner as well as a pressure cooker and a slow cooker.    Mandy suggested you begin by simply putting water in the thing and follow the instructions in your manual.  I'm not really sure where my manual is now but the appliance also has a website with videos.  Anyway, this week I want to get to know this appliance and stop letting fear rule.It's even more silly when you consider that I had and used pressure cookers from age 10 onwards and why I should find this more intimidating than the old-fashioned sort is truly just anxiety.   And yes, I blew the old-fashioned sort up a time or three.   I used a pressure canner successfully without any sort of accident at all.That my appliance is also a slow cooker is a bonus that means this will be a triply useful tool if I'll just get over my fear.  Make bread and bagels and determine what sweet snack item I can make for the household.  Right now, John has some of his cheap, tastes like nothing but sweet, duplex cookies that he loves but I've noted that he eats less of something with real flavor and more if it's just merely sweet.  As with last week, I'll post a separate Menu item, but I've just gone through the fridge this morning though it is Saturday and I pretty much know what I have.Personal/Leisure:  I don't know if I really even know what 'leisure' is anymore.  With a three-year-old in the house, leisure is pretty much what I get when he's in bed for the night or I leave home.When I was in the closet digging for the lost manual that I hadn't lost, lol, I found my big bin full of genealogical notebooks and books and told John, \"I really miss doing this.  Do you think I'll ever again have an opportunity to sit down with it and research more?\"    I'd love to pick up something and work on it.  I really would.  Don't know if that will happen, but perhaps I can sit down one evening and just flip through pages?I'm on a kick.  I have Enchanted April as my reading at the moment.  I have the movie of the same name (and a very close rendition of the book) as well, which I mean to watch.  Then I remembered that I have a Grace Livingston Hill book, April Gold.  So, I've pulled that one to read.  There's apparently a Rosemunde Pilcher book called April Snow, and I'll wager it's in one of the boxes of packed books that I haven't anywhere to put, but that would be fun to add if I do come across it, provided I actually get through the boxes to find it.  I don't often do a themed reading in a month's time, but I thought this was a fun thing for this month.    Then I looked up April and found that there were multiple 'national' days.  For instance, April 12, is National Grilled Cheese Day and April 17 is National Go Fly a Kite Day...Sort of puts you in mind of \"Mary Poppins\", doesn't it?  There are all sorts of days for all sorts of things from food to pets to things to do, like April 23 which is National Picnic Day.Then I found there were April songs.  Like Louis Armstong's rendition of \"April in Paris\" and a Simon and Garfunkel song, \"April Come She Will\".  That made me realize that often I go in search of vintage music for Christmas, winter, Fall but I've never yet done that for Spring or Summer, and why not?  I could have a playlist that lasts me all Spring long!t occurs to me that I can just plan have fun with the whole month of April if I've a mind to do so.Anway, I plan to just play around and see what all I can find to do extra this month that applies to April, including my reading.I think I really need a spa day.  Or a series of spa moments.  And I need desperately to journal.  This weekend has brought that home hard. I must get back to routinely journaling.Amazon Associate Affiliate Link:"},

Neither John nor Little One have been affected in the least.  I'm grateful for that.  I can't imagine having to nurse a sick little boy and a sick man while feeling poorly myself!"},

And most all of the photos in our photo albums were black and white.   So how did it go?  In the end, did I follow my rules for Thanksgiving 2022?Every year, as we end a holiday, I make a few notes of what worked and what didn't.  I usually do this in my general homemaking pages of my personal notebook and not online, but since I was so bold as to profess my \"Survival Plans...\" for this Thanksgiving, I thought I'd be equally as bold and tell you how those plans went.Menu:  I stuck to my menu plan.

{"title": "Coffee Chat:  In September", "date": null, "text": "I seem to be more drawn to coffee chats right now, though I've a long list of ideas and inspirations for posts I want to write upon.  It's just that my mind is so occupied with our present situation that I can't seem to find any oomph to do more than prep meals and very basic housework.  I know that at least three afternoons and one day every weekend, I shall be occupied with Caleb.  That is time consuming to say the least.  We pick him up from nursery three days and keep him each of those evenings until Katie has had time to visit at the hospital after work.  We are all doing our best to give him routine/schedules that he can live with, and he seems to be handling it all fairly well."},
{"title": "Diary of a Homemaker:  Doing What We Can", "date": null, "text": "Saturday:  I'd at least had coffee and breakfast when Katie called to ask if I'd watch Caleb today.  I headed over to her house, where I spent the morning and afternoon chasing down a very spry almost 3-year-old.   Gramma can move quicker than she'd supposed but all that jogging around the house made her very weary.  By the time Katie returned, I felt like a black cloud and acted like one when I got home.This is where the unexpected message of a dear soul did me a world of good and allowed me the privilege of messaging with her for a little bit to get my head straightened out.  She helped me see that though I might feel at times that I am caring for everyone, and no one is caring for me, in fact, many of you, including herself, are caring for me with your prayers and your encouragement.  I felt my spirit lighten and the dark cloud lift as we took a few minutes to chat."},
{"title": "Are You Ready? A Seasonal Inquiry", "date": null, "text": "A few different things happened this week that made me stop and really think about what lies ahead.  I am not predicting the long future here.  I'm merely wondering how prepared I am for the next season and the next few months.  John and I noticed four weeks ago that the grass suddenly slowed down in growth.  We've had enough rain here in our portion of the country the past six weeks or so that it's been growing at the usual rate and then some.  John could barely go 5 days without cutting one of the lawns and then suddenly there was no need to mow for ten days.  We peered at the lawn and pronounced our belief that the growth had slowed way down at supper that night.  In a state where one might easily cut grass from February through December this is unusual enough to be commented upon.Then I was reading through posts from September 2011.  We had an unusually early and cool fall that month.  Cool enough that we barely used our AC at all.  Again: February through December is our more usual timeline for requiring that at some point most days.  If I recall correctly we had one of the coldest autumns we've had in years with temperatures in the low 20's.  Those are occasional winter temps for us.    So, we'd noted the grass slowed, the golden rod suddenly started blooming and the mallow flower stems are fat with buds.  I'd noticed John and I both beginning to crave those hot and hearty cooler weather meals.  Mornings have been cooler so that the AC didn't come on at all for a few hours.  There have been days where it cut on and off routinely these last two weeks, even if the oven was going and heating up the kitchen. Then a few leaves began to change color and to drop onto the lawn below.  It's a little early-ish yet for such activity.I went to read the Farmer's Almanac, which frankly I trust more than most meteorologists, and read of a colder than usual fall ahead for our region and slushy/sleety winter.  Oh my.That was just one case of wondering if I was ready for a different season.   I watched Appalachia Homestead's vlog and she shared a bit of folklore to predict a new season.  She asked if people were ready for winter...winter!  And we're not even into fall just yet.  But as she reasoned, it takes time and planning to get prepared.  It reminded me of the fashion industry.   If you want winter clothes, you'd best buy them in the late summer, very early autumn months because come winter, the stores will be full of bathing suits.  It's not just fall decorations in the stores right now, it's fall clothing lines and winter clothing will be in stores well before Halloween arrives.I've said before, and shall likely say again, I am not a prepper.  I am not interested in being ready for absolutely every scenario and possibility. I don't think we can be fully prepared for every little thing.  But I do know that I need to be aware of what appears to be ahead.  A cold autumn alone is enough to make me want to consider what I might do to insure we are warm and well fed, that we have a source for heating and cooking outside of electricity, that we have warm clothes and cold remedies on hand.  Do we have what is necessary to protect our water supply if we're experiencing extended deep-freezing temperatures come winter?  Do I have enough water in reserve to cover our needs?How can I help others in my family do the same?  The house in town is our responsibility and there are no alternative sources of heating there.  Mama has no alternative source in her apartment either...Where and how can I help them as well as us?  Concern over rising prices and possible supply chain breaks has made me consider how and what I shall feed my household as well as what I might need to help others in my family.  I'm trying to see how I can make the very best possible use of what I already have on hand.  I'm checking multiple sales at stores and making wandering trips into stores with which I'm unfamiliar, trying to see how they might compare pricewise and always, always, always snatching up those things that are good, cheap foods.I'm also considering how I might preserve foods.  My freezer is packed.  I need more storage space, but I really don't want another freezer, except to swap my current chest freezer for an upright.  It's occurred to me that it's time to consider other methods of food preservation, such as dehydrating and pressure canning.  I've a short list of things I want to acquire as finances allow but I'm not discounting what I have already and considering how I might do better.I know we have ample cold medicines with the exception of needing fresh cough drops.  Those are old and super sticky, the way they get at times. I definitely need to get those.  I have a supply of vitamin C as well as Vitamin C based drink mix.  I would like to get some more shelf stable real fruit juices for the season ahead.  Pineapple juice is always beneficial for colds.  I'm good on pineapple itself courtesy a sale this past spring.  And while I believe in the power of homemade chicken soup, if I'm the one who is sick...I might not feel up to making any.  I'd like to supply my freezer with a bit that could be thawed and reheated.  That means creating room in my freezer as well as preparing it.   A few cans of a good quality chicken soup might not be remiss either. It's also time to plan ahead for holiday meals and determine what of those foodstuffs I might go ahead and purchase so that it's on hand.  And mentioning holidays. I've slowly. ever so slowly, started Christmas shopping.  Along about August, I start thinking about Christmas gifts and my goal this year is to be done by October 31.  We'll see if I make that goal or not.  I'm going to have to really get busy.I'm looking a little further ahead to Spring and planning to order a few flower and vegetable seeds this fall.  You see, I know that Spring always comes, and I might as well be prepared for that, too.Amazon Associate Affiliate Link"},

I didn't get to half the things I'd planned out that we might do and I'm mighty sorry I didn't but it's really okay.  I found my pleasures all the same. I read a lot and didn't write beyond doing the daily diary entry.  I started a Bible study of Acts and instead of reading this and that and ten guides and four other parts of the Bible, I've read nothing but a section of a chapter, studied whatever part I felt was not as clear in my understanding, or looked at maps of travels, etc.   I'm also enjoying the history of the time period of Acts.  Rulers, ruling classes, what each man's biography was, etc.   I've written out my thoughts as I go through each section and told John the other morning, \"I feel like I'm really understanding how wonderfully the Word spread in those post Pentecost days.\"  I have been awed."},

{"title": "Planning Meals with Grace Livingston Hill", "date": null, "text": "Grace Livingston Hill mentions detailed menus in some of her books.  I confess that those books are my favorites, usually because they deal with homemaking and how the homemaker is changing lives.  Mrs. Hill may occasionally share a beautiful room description or talk about a dress color and style, as well but when she feeds her characters she comes up with some pretty good meals.  Often, they not only sound good, but they are economical.   Although the books were written in a different era, I thought it would be fun to share a few of her menu plans from some of the books I've read most recently. These menus are old fashioned meals and not fancy but they sound really delicious.  Tell me what you think after reading through a few of these.  I'll share the title of each book I copied out menus from."},

When he returned home, he would often slip away into the chapel next door to the school where his father taught and taught himself to play the harmonium.   It wasn't until an elderly blind woman who had taken time to sit and listen to the child and give him pointers on his playing expressed her appreciation of his music that his father was even aware the child had been taking refuge in the chapel."},
{"title": "Homemaking Instinct", "date": null, "text": "Show of hands please:  How many of you are homemakers?  If you're living in a studio apartment or an RV, in a tiny house or a three bed, two bath house, or if you've camped out, you're a homemaker.  It is the instinct of most, man and woman alike, to create a home wherever you live.  It begins in early childhood when children first play 'house'.  It continues on through all our lives.Many years ago, I spent six weeks in a physical rehab center after a car accident.  I noticed that my section of the room took on a distinct personality of its own.  A bulletin board meant for nurse's notes, also contained quotes that moved me deeply, cards from friends, photos of my children.  The bedside counter had flowers and an array of makeup and facial products.  Across the foot of the bed was a cozy blanket in pretty colors.  I'd created in what was meant to be a temporary space, a home of my own.  I missed only having books.   At that time in my life that 'home' was vitally important to me.  Two days prior to my accident, I'd left my husband and had no home of my own to shelter my children and myself.  We were staying with Granny, a place meant to be very temporary.  My next home didn't come along for three months after leaving rehab.  I went to live with Mama and Daddy.   I had no place to call 'mine'.  My children and I shared a room.  I was reminded daily that it wasn't my home, I was temporary and wasn't living there.  I think that inability to create anything resembling a spot of my own greatly increased my sense that the world as I knew it had fallen apart. A friend and co-worker knew of an empty house on her street, talked to the owner and introduced me to my new rental place three months later, a house where we lived for the next six years.  Even though it wasn't mine, I made it mine.  I cleaned the overgrown yards and planted flowers.  I piled junk culled from the house and outer reaches of the yards along the curb for pick up.  I painted walls and bought furniture.  It was as much to create a sense of home as knowing I could belong in that place.I was working at the nursing home during this time in social services.   I noticed that nearly every new resident gradually made themselves at home.  It was evident that the instinct to create a space to live, to make a place a home, was something that seemed to be a natural thing for every person. They brought in a favorite chair, hung pictures, arranged and organized their belongings to suit themselves, and had lovely blankets or quilts on their beds.  Some had plants that they lined up on the windowsills.  It wasn't just decorating the rooms but the duties of homemaking that kept them involved.  Almost all of them had their little housekeeping routines even though there was a housekeeping staff who came in daily.  Dusting, watering plants, putting away clean laundry, bundling up dirty laundry, making beds, were all done by most of the residents.  I've noted that many who have office spaces, are just as keen to put their personal stamp on their workspace and have some sort of cleaning routines to keep those spaces looking spruce.  We teased Katie about 'nesting' into her new office, but that's pretty much what she did.We are all homemakers at heart.  When I first married, I was given a couple of cast iron frying pans.  One was about 8 inches and was meant to be my cornbread pan.  The other was a 12-inch skillet.  They had been well seasoned by Granny, and I kept and used them with minimal upkeep for nearly 25 years.  I used my cast iron nearly every day.  I usually avoided cooking eggs in my skillet, especially the cornbread skillet, because I found it needed to be re-seasoned many times before it was non-stick for cornbread once more.  I washed my pans in soap and water and I cooked spaghetti and chili in them many an afternoon, letting them simmer long and slow.   I found over the years that truly there is not a lot you can't do in an iron skillet as long as you keep them clean and you occasionally re-season."},

Mostly he just says one word.  But it's proof he can speak a sentence. Immediately after he passed the stove, he snatched his plate off the counter and sent food flying across the floor, sigh.  Gramma isn't as quick as she used to be and even when she thinks she's got things well out of reach, littlest boys grow more than you realize between visits!   He played cook and mixed various concoctions, we played with matchbox cars and then he found my wireless ear buds that no longer work and played for a good forty minutes with those before he began yawning widely.He's not asleep, a fact that makes John very nervous.  In checking on him we've found he's piled all the pillows from the bed on his cot but beyond that he's staying on the cot and talking to himself, banging his sippy cup against the wall, etc.  All of this makes John incredibly nervous.  I've been around Caleb at night when he goes to bed, and he always spends time chatting and talking to himself and then he finally goes off to sleep.  He really doesn't get off his little bed and mess with anything.Meals:  Bagels with cream cheesePizzaHot Dogs, Baked Beans, FruitSunday:  Happy Mother's Day!  I thought I'd sleep in this morning, but I didn't.  I got up about the usual time.  I seldom go to church on the 'big' holidays because it's usually crowded and heavy traffic in the parking lots, etc.  We planned ahead of time to watch here at home this morning and that's what we did.  John helped me make the bed, I prepared breakfast and loaded the dishwasher and had a lunch plan though it ended being just the two of us.  I made a dessert I like for Spring.  I heard from all my girls and Amie's partner, but thus far nothing from my boys.  I do not get hurt over lack of cards or communications on Mother's Day.  In my lifetime Mother's Day was always a big deal and it was lovely on the one hand when we could be with extended family, but on the other, there were things that made it unpleasant.  Those who are perpetually disappointed will rather spoil things for others and I'm sorry to say that's what happened to me.  As an adult I made a fuss over Mother's Day for Granny and Mama, but we'll just refer back to that previous sentence and that will be enough said about that.  My children got a bad taste for Mother's Day due to that and it was just not something they wanted to be involved with.  My children do many things for me throughout the year.  I don't just do for them.  I only share what I've done because that's my business to share.  What they do, big and little things, we keep to ourselves because that is their business and I have no right to publicly announce it.  But let me assure you that most especially the two who are nearby give plenty in return for what we might do for them.  John found an old series on YouTube called \"The Lieutenant\" about a Marine, William T. Rice.  It's a really good series and we have enjoyed several episodes.  I highly recommend it to anyone else who likes a black and white vintage drama.I finished reading Elizabeth Goudge's The Scent of Water this morning and as always, immediately upon finishing a book, I'm too caught up with it still to move right on to the next one.  I've a large stack of books I want to read, but I can't quite decide at the moment what's next...I'll keep you posted!The rest of the day was spent catching up on vlogs I've skipped watching over the week.  I really enjoyed that quiet afternoon of doing nothing.Meals:  Kielbasa and Potato Hash with Steamed Eggs, English MuffinsFried Chicken, Stuffing, leftover potato salad, Green Peas, Strawberry CobblerLeftovers of aboveMonday:  Perhaps it was the exhaustion from several nights running of not sleeping well, or brought on by the pain we've both been in the past couple of days.  Maybe it was the cooler air in the night.  Or perhaps the heating pad on achy joints but we slept in this morning and I do mean slept in.  I haven't slept so late in quite a long time.  John had asked last night for a special breakfast.  I assured him that was already on my list for the week and that's one thing I got done.  I doubled the recipe and put all the extras into the freezer.The morning seemed to fly by after that and before I could even think what else I might get done, it was time to get ready and leave the house.  Even though we left a bit early, we were a little later than I'd hoped to be and that meant not stopping off for the stroller. Well never mind that.  His nursery school experience has made him quite capable of walking along (or just ahead like any male) of me and he led me out of the labyrinth of halls to the door that took us back outside.At the doctor's office, he quickly discovered that I had 'cookies' (grahams) in my bag and we had a major tantrum over my refusal to let him have one right away.  I wasn't sure what was entailed in his exam and didn't want him eating in the exam room anyway.  I made good on my promise and gave him a cookie as soon as we were back at the car.We'd missed lunch entirely today with our late breakfast and hasty leave-taking and such so John stopped to get us a sandwich.  We pulled over into our church parking lot and ate. I sat in the back seat and Caleb ate easily half my plate of grape salad, pickle and pimento cheese sandwich.  That little boy can eat!  I am always surprised.  I don't know why, because I do recall that Isaac was the same.Once home, he ate two of those huge strawberries, another graham called \"Mamama, eat!\" the moment he realized I was getting supper together, lol.  He and Katie had dinner with us and then headed home.  Little boy blew me a kiss and I don't mind telling you, I melted into warm puddles over that. I got the dishes done after supper and quit for the day.  It was a lovely day, but it's felt inexplicably long.  Tomorrow is a free day though, and hopefully much will get done then.Meals:  Pancakes, SausagePimento Cheese Sandwich, Grape Salad, Pickle (shared with Caleb)Leftover Beef Pot Pie, Chicken/Broccoli/Rice Casserole, steamed broccoli    Truthfully supper fell flat. I knew Katie and Caleb would be staying to supper and thought there wasn't enough of either thing to make a meal for four (might as well go on and count Caleb as an adult, that boy can eat!) so we all had a bit of what I had to offer.  It filled us but we were roaming about later looking for snacks.Tuesday:  I haven't gotten to work yet on the living room but I keep finding plenty to do all the same.  I suppose it's the cooler mornings making us sleep in much later than usual because we slept late again this morning.  I made a quick breakfast and then got busy.My first task was just to clean surfaces, putting things away.  I worked my way through the rooms doing that and then went to make the bed.  That's when I discovered the fitted sheet had two tiny tears.  I decided to use scraps of white sheeting and mending tape to repair those.  I know that it's time to replace it, thought as much when I put it on the bed this past Friday.  I didn't take it off the bed, simply slipped the scrap of fabric with a bit of the hemming tape trapped between the sheet and scrap and laid the warm iron right on it.I cleared my desk of mail and then fixed the printer.  I had to purchase the regular ink cartridges.  The refilled ones were not the same, though the labeling underneath said they were.  There was a difference in how the ends looked, not where the microchips are inserted but the other end.  The printer is happy once more...The difference in costs is big, and I won't feel nearly so free to use the printer because of costs, but so be it.   I tried something new and it was a fail.  Small loss.After puttering around indoors, I went out and blew off the front porch and patio.  Then I fed the cat and walked around back to cut out the tree I'd spied growing in the midst of the big rose bush.  Glad I did that because now there were six trees of various sizes hidden in the growth.  I also trimmed out the roseless canes, cut back the overhanging branches now the roses are pretty much done blooming and cut back the lantana canes from last year.  I was pleased to find another of the Asian lilies coming up near the lantana that I'll try to rescue later.  Also loads and loads of tiny baby gladiolus corms have come up again near the base of the house.  I'm going to try to move those and replant them.  John came out to watch me work and then decided that we needed to trim some overhanging branches on the pecan tree so that the Gingko would get a bit more sun.  Those limbs got piled up and then I gathered up all the limbs and trees and such I'd cut this morning and walked around to trim the rose bush I planted in front of the back porch.  One branch hung way out into the yard and I just knew it was going to end scratching someone badly.  I had told John when the roses were done blooming I'd cut that branch back entirely so I did that.  I didn't pick up those branches. Instead I told John I was done and I came indoors.  I wasn't really done.  I just put in lunch to reheat and settled in my chair after lunch for a couple of hours.   Then I decided to work on organizing the records and Cd's.  Let me tell you, I had no idea that was going to be such a big job!  As I was putting things in order, alphabetical by first names on most which will work for us very well, I decided I'd best check the CD cases.  Well, glad I did!  Because I must have two dozen or more that hadn't a thing in them.  Three hours later...Yes, really, it all took me about three hours.  Then it was time to start supper and who was it that completely and totally forget she'd been reminding herself to get meat out to thaw?  Yep.I think I am done for the day now.  I plan to be away from home tomorrow for a portion of the day and likely will do little beyond the things required to accomplish those errands from start to finish tomorrow.  I had big plans this week, but will I see big results?  I just don't know.Meals:  Cheese Grits, ToastPizzaKielbasa, Cabbage, Potatoes, Carrots, Rye BreadWednesday:   Another beautiful day.  The sun is shining and the trees in full leaf offer up some shade.  It's very dry outdoors.  There's no chance of rain in the forecast and some hot days ahead.  John won't mow grass because it's so very dry already.   I think I'm going to have to resort to the water saving ways and use dishwater and shower warm up water to keep plants alive.   I'm feeling very uncertain of whether I should plant seeds or not.  Perhaps I should just tuck the tomato plants into my usual flower bed.  That would save the purchase of soil, too.   Decisions must be made.I picked up the house this morning after breakfast, going from room to room.  It doesn't require much upkeep these days, true, but it's always a little surprising how much accumulates on surfaces after I finish 'work' for the day.  Even though we clear the dishes from the living room (usually just a glass or cup), I put them on the kitchen counter.  So why does the house look a big mussed in the morning?  Seriously, are there fairies who come in and make things look less than nice?After I'd picked up the house and tidied things, I sat down with my checkbook and brought it up to date.  I worked out our budget for the month.  I wrote out checks and have them ready to go into the mail.After I worked on that task, I went back to the kitchen.   I went in with the idea of making something for lunch.  Opening the refrigerator, I realized I needed to start my supper prep and while I was gathering ingredients for lunch and supper, I noted that I really should go ahead and make egg rolls while the ingredients I'd purchased are still fresh.One thing leads to another doesn't it?   Lunch prep, egg roll filling prep, supper prep and then I thought, while the oven is on, why don't I also make up a batch of muffins?  It's always handy to have those to heat quickly for a breakfast or for a snack.  I was grating carrot for supper, as well as for lunch.  Why not grate a bit more for muffins?   It only took a couple of minutes more work.That little bit of work in the kitchen carried me right up to lunch time.  After lunch I finished each item off and then everything went into the oven at the same temperature.  I had to put the eggrolls on the bottom shelf and that meant turning them about 10 minutes into baking but it also means I got a nice crispy shell on them.  End result is that the main dish for supper is finished already.  I need only make sides to go with it.  I also have 1 dozen carrot muffins and 14 egg rolls.   I have more egg roll wrappers but I have used all my onions now so I can't make more right now, but I will because I like to really have a good supply of these in the freezer.I said last month I'd purchased egg rolls for $2.99 at Aldi.  There are four in a package so about 50c each.  In a conventional grocery they are a bit nearer $1 each.  I bought a finely shredded cabbage on sale for $2.50 and egg roll wrappers for $2.50 a package.  I used one carrot, a bit of celery and onion and a bit of shredded broccoli stem.  I opened and used packets of take away soy sauce that has been in the fridge.  I keep a bag of those packets of things in the fridge and usually take it on vacation with us.  It's surprising how often I want just those things only in a very small amount.All told, I spent $5.50 tops for 14 eggrolls at about 39c each.  I have shredded my own cabbage to use in them in the past, but the angel hair cut is a lot nicer in my opinion.  I plan to price another bag of that at Aldi when we shop there, just so I can make another batch of eggrolls.I had planned initially to go grocery shopping today, but I think I'm going to put it off.  I'd like to get whole chickens at Publix this weekend when we go over for church.   Their price per pound is cheaper than the last sale at the discount grocery in the next town.  I can buy some onions then, too.  At present we've plenty of milk, flour, cheese and eggs.  I have 2/3 of a big head of iceberg lettuce, 1/2 head of cabbage and two more broccoli stalks to use as salad ingredients and we have plenty of potatoes, carrots and celery.  I figure if I put off going to Aldi another week or two, I can manage just fine.  This may be just what I need to get myself turned back around with the budget.Oh dear!  The propane company came back to spray a fresh coat of paint over the tank.  Rufus ran out in front of the truck and his little paw got pinched.  The service driver was the same young man who turned off our gas last time he was here and forgot to turn it back on.  Poor young man was in tears over Rufus who is fine.  He's holding his paw up, but when we checked it there was no yelping or crying.  I think he's more miffed that he actually got caught by the truck.  This has been a constant battle here and generally when someone strange comes up in a vehicle, we offer the dogs a biscuit when the stranger starts to leave.  That distracts them from chasing and acting protective.  I've given him a baby aspirin and hopefully that will help his hurt paw, whether or not it helps his hurt feelings I can't say.Meals:  Cheese Omelet, ToastBuffalo turkey Meatballs and salad    Bess brought these to us early this week after she'd made them and boy were they delicious.  I've just gotten the recipe from her so I can make more of those.  I noted in the picture she sent me, she'd gotten 2 dozen from her batch.  Meatloaf, Mashed Potatoes, Green Beans, Corn, MuffinsThursday:  The consensus between the two houses here on this place is that we won't mow grass until we get some rain.  It is too dry to cut it and the blades of grass are twisting.  There's been little growth in the past ten days or so.  So that is off the agenda for the moment.  Does it mean John is done with yardwork entirely?  Nope.  We will try to get over to Katie's and weed eat about her fence and mailbox sometime in the next few days.  And John will do mower maintenance, sharpening blades and such to ensure that the next time he cuts he's ready to go.I was up much earlier this morning than I have been all week long.  I knew Millie was coming to spend the morning with me and I wanted to be fully awake and full of coffee when she arrived.  Overall, she's easier to keep than Caleb.  Her ability to communicate is slightly greater than his and that is in her favor.  Admittedly with Caleb, as with Isaac, I seem to have an instinct for what is wanted.  Millie has already made up her mind what she wants and having her able to communicate that makes it somewhat easier to keep her.  Of course, she's just as adamantly sure of what she does NOT want and often that's whatever she's just specifically asked for, lol.I did note that she seemed to be running a low fever.  The boys were both sick earlier this week and I suspect that Wee Miss has succumbed to whatever they had.  She spent most of the afternoon either sitting on my lap or lying draped across me in some way.  She wasn't whiny nor fussy nor lethargic, just a little more than warm.John was gone from home today having lunch with his EMS partner.  Dear man sent John home with a big, lovely cabbage and a handful of fresh onions, yellow and red.  I know John thought I smiled rather foolishly over the onions but it's always amazing to me that these little things I need are somehow just given to me.  I explained to John that I'd just used the last of the onions and needed to buy more, the only thing I really need for groceries this week.  Not a busy day and not a productive one.  Any desire to do much of anything had long flown.  I finished reading my latest Mitford book, A New Song.  I'd meant to read Karon's books in order of publication but have no desire to read the next book, A Common Life as it is not sequential.  Instead I'm skipping ahead to the one published after that, In This Mountain.Since I knew I'd be home all day today, I took time to bake bread for Shabat.  It's one thing I won't have to do tomorrow.  John has set his plans for the day tomorrow.  I'll do my usual Shabat cleaning and then I'm going to run to the bank and tend to a blog errand.Friday:  I'm very late getting this finished up this week.  I let myself get distracted by another blog post.  Last night John mentioned his plans for the day.  He didn't do one of those things at all.  I mentioned mine.Did I attend to mine?  I did...I did everything I'd had on my list and then I got ready to leave the house.  Somehow though, I was reluctant to do it.  What I wanted to happen was for John to want to go somewhere with me.  He didn't.  He'd just had a whole day out yesterday and he was satisfied with that.  We talked briefly of going to Macon to see about getting something else done and that fell through.  John was back to his decision to stay home.  I was back to running errands on my own.  He said, \"You look disappointed,\" and I told him \"I am but I don't know why.  I've done everything I planned to do today and I was fine with my plans last night and I was fine with them this morning.  But somehow I feel let down.\"  I went on to run the errands and then returned home, bringing a late lunch with me.  John had asked me to stop and pick it up and I obliged him.  That's it.  That was my week aside from the work I was doing on the blog post this afternoon.How did your week go?Amazon Affiliate Link  If you order through this link I earn a small

{"title": "John Wants Sandwiches", "date": null, "text": "A number of years ago, when our family size decreased to just three people, I gave up buying lunch meats for sandwiches.    Katie didn't care for ham.  I found that I didn't care for any sandwich meat except for the deli meats, and they were super pricey.  I think John was insisting on salads only for his lunches about this time.  So, we stopped buying packaged lunch meats entirely.  We might splurge now and then, usually on vacation or around a birthday on deli sliced meat, but I felt we could go without and so we did.  In my quest these last few months to waste no food at all, we've eaten leftovers most days for lunch.  I was fine with that, but John confessed the other day that while he understands why I'm doing this, he sometimes wishes I'd just put a sandwich on the table.   Truth, I could never eat a sandwich and be perfectly happy.  John honestly likes them.  I want to please my husband.  I want to stick hard to my budget and no food waste plan.  What's a homemaker to do?Well, I'll just do it all!"},

{"title": "Over the Fence:  One More for April", "date": null, "text": "It's late afternoon.  Late to be stopping for a chat but you see, April ends this weekend and I really wanted to have one more chat before it was over.  I'm not really sure that I have much to say.  I'm in a period of writing something nearly every day just now and you'd think I'd have poured myself out and have nothing more but that's mostly been targeted pieces on specific subjects, and I want a chat.  Chats tend to be mostly random things that lead naturally one to another and somehow end up having something in common that reveals itself later on. Saturday:  We don't go to the Strawberry Festival every year, but we do enjoy going occasionally.  I'd mentioned to John I'd like to go this year more than once.  Each time, he'd remained quiet.  I was all too well aware that his not answering is an answer of sorts but this morning, I asked him one more time if he'd planned to go.  \"No, not at all.\"   I knew Katie and the children were going, I knew Bess and the children were going, and I really wanted to go as well.  I told Katie I'd drive into town and call her when I got there, and we'd meet up.  John was absolutely not having it.  He went and got dressed, grumbling the whole while. I explained to him that I am perfectly able to go into town on my own.  No, he wasn't going to let me go on my own. I told him he didn't have to go.  Oh yes, he did.   Finally, I said, amongst the grumbles, \"You are a very dear man...\" and he snapped hard, \"But...?\"  \"There is no but.  I said you're a very dear man and I mean it.\"  I confess I bit my tongue hard at that point and I do mean hard.   The truth is he is also a very reasonable man for the most part and he knew full well what the 'but...' was that I might have added to that statement.  However, I sincerely was saying to him that he was a dear man and that was all I meant.  He left it at that, and we proceeded to go to the festival peaceably.  Why spoil a pleasant time if we could just get along by not saying unnecessary things?"},

I felt his hands and feet and they were warm enough, so I left him alone.  I have no idea why he wanted those pants legs so short, lol."},

I get so much pleasure from watching the birds.  The boys' feeders are hung in trees that they can see both from the living room and their bedroom."},

I don't want those to go rancid.   I had one bit of waste last week.  I went to use the corn tortillas and discovered they'd turned a nasty shade of grey.  I wasn't about to use them so I opened the flour tortillas I'd bought this past pay period.  I like corn tortillas but I do not use them as well as I do flour ones.  John will use the flour tortillas to make roll up sandwiches but not the cornmeal ones.  So in future I think I'll stick with the flour tortillas.  I almost always end up with some waste when I have the cornmeal ones on hand...so no more buying those unless I can find smaller packages of them. It's been about four years since I last wrote about Shoebox Suppers and all of that time I've held that concept in the back of my mind.   This month, with Annabel writing of disaster preparedness as well she might with things the way they are in her country, and our having already experienced our first Tropical depression of the season a whole month earlier than usual, as well as the increased activity of the C word thingy, it seems like a good idea to now revisit the idea of a tiny portion of preparedness work I'd meant to do long ago and get it done as one of my own bits.So let's revisit the concept of Shoe Box Suppers briefly.  I shared my ideas, as did a few readers in these two posts which I also linked last week.  The first post is here and there was a follow-up post.  I compiled a list last weekend of those ideas I'd shared, and those that others had shared in the comments.  I visited the site Lana recommended on those posts, Southern Plate.  She calls her meals Bags to Dishes meals.  I wrote out all the ones that I wanted to try."},

I could buy a decent mix at Aldi for 85c a box.   Yes, I still had to add eggs and oil, but even so it was a decent price compared to my homemade version.   But I missed the flavor of homemade brownies.   And honestly...a store bought mix is never going to taste as good as homemade.   There are too many chemicals added in to preserve the ingredients and inhibit mold growth.A few years ago, I stumbled upon a Brownie mix recipe in one of my 1950's September issues of Woman's Day and I jotted it down on paper, shoved it in my recipe files and there it stayed until this past month when I decided to give it a try."},

Hinckley) Is food storage on my mind for a reason?  Not for any more reasons than usual.  I have heard the stories of shocking price increases in some parts of the country.  I've seen a more gentle rise, but a rise nonetheless, of costs here in our area.  My interest in food storage has indeed increased over the past few years only because of what we've had go on in our family.  We've had children move in which would have strained the budget unduly had we not had a pantry to help us along.  We have had children moved out,  children that got married and  children go through divorce, all who needed to literally start pantries from scratch and my gift to them was a supply of basics to start them off.   I know too well how costly it can be to start with nothing and try to set up just a basic starter pantry.  We've had spells of  illness or family members who required care and shopping was the last priority so I dug into my pantry to supply us all in those times as well.  There were a few tough months financially that necessitated going deep into the pantry and minimizing grocery trips.  So I know too well how valuable my pantry has been as both a resource and an 'emergency fund'."},

{"title": "Goals for June", "date": null, "text": "I've had a productive and pleasant May in my home.  I accomplished several of my goals and that always pleases me.  I so enjoy looking back and seeing that no matter what else happened, I was able to look at my list and focus when I had time to devote to my plans.I wish, at times, that I could accomplish all on my list but I seldom do.   So many things happen in a month that are not planned.  Most of my goals are approachable in steps so that I can fit in 15 minutes here or an extended spell of work there and eventually get it all finished up.    I found several kitchens this week I wanted to share.  Two or three new to me Hazel Dell Brown ones that made me swoon.  If anyone could add the va-va-voom to a kitchen it was that designer!  And she was so versatile.  A modern city apartment or a Pennsylvania farmhouse could both benefit from her design touch.But what I finally decided to share was what I felt was a rather astonishing contrast between a 1911 kitchen and a 1930-something kitchen.   Just look at the difference 20 years could make in a kitchen!The 1911 kitchen is open and spacious and attractive but a bit sparse.  As I gaze at it I wonder, \"Where did they store anything?\"  How many steps did that homemaker make between cellar/pantry, to sink or table?  How many more from table to stove or fridge?  No wonder the later ads all spoke wisely of 'step-saving' kitchens and often commented that more modern kitchens kept a woman 'young'!I can see that modernization was at play in this design.  For one thing there are the tile walls which would make it more hygienic simply because they could be more easily washed down.  I love the additional light this kitchen has and I can see that electric or gas light hangs from the ceiling here.  The 1930s kitchen on the other hand is a marvel just in contrast if nothing more, isn't it?  The overhead lighting is ample and centered over the two main workspaces.  There's storage galore.  The double sink is right behind the double oven stove for vegetable prep,  within a step or two of the dish storage (which likely is also handy to the dining room proper) and the breakfast area.  The refrigerator is in the room and there's suitable space for eating an early morning breakfast on the run.  The double storage behind the sink would likely serve as a pantry.  There's lots of natural light as well as the electric overhead lighting and there is a decent amount of counter top work spaces.  I'd no doubt have been thrilled in either era to have the kitchens pictured above, but I can see easily why a more modern kitchen worked so well for any household where a single female was responsible for the duties therein.Work:  I allowed myself a long weekend.  I was sharing with a friend that it's funny how we never ever had a Memorial day picnic or anything ongoing because John was always working.   Then last year, when he had his first ever Memorial day off, the world was shut down.   And here we are this year looking at the first holiday weekend of summer as though it were any other day... I think one of my children had a long weekend holiday with his kids but Katie and Sam both had other things to deal with in their households and the holiday was the last thing on their minds.  So I decided to make it a long weekend for myself.  To be honest, it wasn't hard to convince myself of it.  I am struggling with a variety of minor issues and currently that issue is TMJ pain.  Interestingly it came around again right along with a painful few days of  IBS.  On reading, I discovered, much to my surprise, that the two are often linked.  So there you go just in case you didn't know.  I'm not devastated but I'm definitely not feeling well and running low grade fever with the IBS.  So it was easy to convince myself I needed a day off.Mind you my 'day off' still involves meals and I did a load of laundry to hang outdoors and there was bread to bake and the bed to remake and...You get the picture.  I did about my usual amount of work albeit at a slightly slower pace.This long weekend won't offset the month too much workwise.   The calendar shows me that we've pretty much five weeks in June.  I'll have plenty of time to get all my zone work in despite allowing myself a long weekend.This week: Zone 1 Kitchen/Laundry/Back EntryLast month I said I'd tackle the wall above the entry way shelf.  I did not do that.  This month that will be my primary focus.  I also want to frame some pictures to go in the laundry area.  I had some old magazine illustrations of dress patterns hanging there but I moved them several months ago to the wall above the sewing table.  I'd love to put something back above the machines.  It was pleasant to stand there and look at them as I folded clothes.   The laundry overall could use a bit of finesse.I've also made a goal for each zone this month to declutter.   So that will also be on the work list this week for the kitchen.I've minor work to do with the checkbook.  I need to write a check, allot some funds and just bring things up to date.   I have promised Mama a visit.I want to set up a June wardrobe.  I have new pieces to incorporate and that will also generate a new post this week, so there's an added bit of work.And then I'm going to just stop planning right here because I don't have a clue what the week might bring.  It's enough to plan this much and do all the regular daily/weekly jobs that I'd normally do.Kitchen:Cookies are on my radar.  John likes having cookies on hand.  Well so do I!  However I find that I am prone to eat far fewer of the homemade cookies than I do of the store bought extra cheap sort.  I'm going to try to get a few cookie doughs made up and put several in the freezer(...Second thought perhaps some of those cookie mixes in a jar? or some of both?) and I will bake a few fresh for this week.  I'm really wanting brownies, so I think I'll make those first.   I'm tempted to try a 1950's homemade mix for brownies.  Of course, I'll make bread and perhaps some biscuits for the freezer this week and a batch of muffins?  We'll see.  Too much is too much already and I don't want to overwhelm us with too many things at once for eating fresh. I'm not doing a Gathered Fragments section this week because I truly don't have much in the fridge as leftovers at present.   There's tuna pasta salad for lunch one day,  That's it.    Honestly,  I'm glad!  I had a whole week off from cooking last week and I enjoyed it right up until the last couple of days and then I just groaned knowing there were leftovers in the fridge that would go to waste unless we ate them.  Not the sort I could 'makeover' leftovers,  either.  But you know what?  We ate them all, except that soup I gave to the dogs.  No waste for us last week.  May the new week ahead bring fresh foods and fewer leftovers.Here's what I have loosely planned for this week's meals.  The first meal is what we ate on Saturday:BBQ country Style Beef Ribs (crockpot), hashed brown casserole (freezer), slaw I had leftovers of BBQ  Beef that we turned into sandwiches on Sunday.  I'll use the rest of the sides up this week.  Pizza leftovers, Chips and Dip, Banana Ice Cream Cups not the healthiest supper but we've eaten healthy all week and all day long.  One such meal as this feels like I'm taking a day off from my job as chef and dishwasher perfect for a holiday weekend.Grilled Steak, Armenian Potatoes, Blue Cheese Wedge SaladsGrilled Greek Chicken, Cucumber and Tomato Salad, Rice Pilaf   I want to buy feta for the salad and Pita bread.  There should be enough leftovers of chicken and the cucumber/tomato salad  to at least make lunch pitas one day this week.  Chef's Salads, Toast Triangles We never manage to eat Beef Burritos, Yellow Rice,  Pico De Gallo, Green SaladChicken Tortellini Salad, Crusty Bread, Fresh Watermelon  The recipe calls for tortellini but I happen to have frozen cheese ravioli and that's what I'll use.  It's the dressing for this dish that makes it so yummy.  I also happen to be getting fresh green garden peas this week so I'm setting aside a few to use in this dish.Personal:I'd like to do a mini spa treatment for myself this week with a mask, exfoliation, and fresh pedicure.   The day I go out to visit Mama I'll take time to stop by a favorite store where I buy a lot of my costume jewelry pieces and see if anything catches my eye there.   While I'm in the same shopping center I will go into a nearby thrift store and look around.I've started a new book Jane Austen's Town and Country Style by Susan Watkins that is really interesting.  Cutting flowers for the house.Taking time to have coffee or tea on the porch as I do my Bible study each day.Just for fun this weekend we watched \"The 21st Century\" with Walter Cronkite hosting.   Some of the predictions for 2001 did happen if a little later and lot more compactly than predicted.   Anyway, I thought you all might like to take time to watch this and see how well they did in some of their predictions."},

{"title": "This Week In My Home:  May I?", "date": null, "text": "Because of an old home economics book I'd picked up at a thrift or antique shop in the past, I know that the 1920's ushered in a somewhat new trend in kitchens.   The reason why we see so much linoleum in kitchens in the 1940's is something that began to be a big push in the 1920's.  Home Economists were quickly becoming aware that Hygiene and cleanliness truly were key factors in good health and they realized that many of the kitchens in which people made their meals were unsanitary.  Wooden surfaces, floors and rough tables, walls, etc.  were breeding grounds.  Hence the push to make kitchens both functional and lovely with glazed tiles.  However, the cost of a full tiled kitchen was out of reach of most humble purses.  And that is where linoleum came into play.   Here it is May 1 and I gave in this morning to curiosity and began to research the practice of May poles and May baskets.  I was prompted to study it further after starting The Honor Girl by Grace Livingston Hill.  Mrs. Hill in the opening pages of Chapter 1 of the book.Most of the programme was over.  The tall, white robed queen with flowing hair, and wreaths of smilax  and asparagus fern, like emerald frost-work over her white garments, had marched in with her fairy attendants dressed in all manner of fantastic costumes.  They had place her upon the throne, crowned her, danced about her and the Maypole; danced separately and together; danced with pink, blue and white ribbons around and around the pole until it stood sheathed in its woven rainbow."},

was past 1pm.  Which means nothing thawed in time for this evening's meal.  There were not a lot of fragments in the fridge after our trip but I did have a few and then I have a few others in the freezer so here we start a new week with a plan to use what we have first and what we've most recently purchased last, but well before it starts to turn. Each time I come across the story of David, I can't help but look at the story of Michal, daughter of Saul, first wife of David.   Here is a woman all too often maligned for her behavior towards David when he danced before the ark as it was brought home but can we just stop and look at her from a human level?  The Bible is a true accounting of humans and  human nature as much as it is of God's nature.  We can't slice off one without getting some of the other.   We are intertwined even though we might choose to think otherwise.  And while human emotions are often tangled and confusing to us, they do serve a purpose to show us God's nature in some form.   After all, it is God who created emotion within each of us.So let us look closely at Michal for a little bit, shall we?  What made her as she was? When David was a youth (supposedly between 16 and 19 years of age), he was an experienced shepherd.  He was  the youngest of Jesse's sons, and it was his duty to carry sustenance to his brothers in whatever military station they were placed.  There came a day when David arrived at an army camp only to hear Goliath maligning God.   David was deeply offended, more so than any other man in the camp.  He offered to slay Goliath.  The 'prize' for killing Goliath was to be Saul's oldest daughter, Merab, given to any man who dared face that giant.    But when David slay Goliath, he turned down the opportunity to be wed to Saul's daughter.  He felt what he had done was for God's gain not his own personal gain.    And this suited Saul quite well. Saul saw a chance to politically align himself with a more powerful and possibly wealthier king, something David was not.   So his daughter Merab was given to another.   Later when Saul discovered that his younger daughter Michal was in love with David, Saul offered her as a bride to David.   By this point in history, Saul had come to realize that even though he had not taken advantage of it, David had received God's favor.   That old saying \"Hold your friend close but your enemies closer,\" might well have been written just due to Saul's position at this point in history.   Saul then offered Michal, his younger daughter to David.   Saul's bride price for Michal was 100 foreskins from slain Philistines.  This highly unusual bride price was requested for two reasons: number one, as the youngest son of Jesse, David's portion of Jesse's inheritance would have been too small to allow him to pay a suitable bride price for a King's daughter.  Number two, Saul had an ulterior motive.  He thought surely if David were to attempt to take the foreskins of 100 fierce fighting men, he'd die in the process!    What a shock it must have been when David returned and gave Saul 200 foreskins and was unscathed.Michal became David's wife.  By this time, David was well aware that God's favor had been removed from Saul and given to himself.   He knew that in gaining Michal he was gaining a political advantage.  He was no longer a youth but a man and could calculate the benefits to himself.    Michal was in love.  The scriptures never mention David's love.  It was seemingly a mercenary move on his part, and perhaps just a passage of adulthood to him.  But he was positioning himself for the future when he would become the true king of Israel and a princess of the prior King as a bride was not an inconsiderable bonus.Shortly after their marriage, David learns Saul has planned to kill him.  He escapes with Michal's help.  She lowers him from an upper window and places a statue in their marital bed, covering it with blankets and states that he is ill when Saul's guardsmen arrive to arrest him.  When it is discovered that Michal has helped David escape, she tells her angry father that he himself had placed her in danger by giving her hand in marriage to David.  She hints that David has abused her and blames her father for placing her in danger with a man he knew to be lesser in his class status than the bride he was given as well as his own personal enemy.  Of equal truth here is that David himself has placed Michal's life in jeopardy.   Her love for him and her willingness to betray the King, regardless of his status as her father, meant that she herself could well lose her life.   As fortune has it, her reply to her father is sincere enough to warrant that her life is spared. Saul, on the advice of his counsel, reportedly chose to see David as dead already, though he was very much alive.  And so, he considered his daughter a widow and passed her on to another man, likely one with whom he also might have some political alliance.   Poor Michal!  And I do mean that in sympathy! She is very much in love with David, has risked her life for him in facing the wrath of her father and yet she has become the wife of another man whom she does not love.  Her father has used her as a pawn a second time.  There is no accounting of her marriage to Paltiel beyond the Biblical mention. Jewish oral tradition holds that she never had children by Paltiel because of his own desire to honor God.  He would not have sexual relations with her until he was sure that she was a widow.   Perhaps so.  But that makes for a very frustrated woman, pining for one man in her heart and living with another who is too honorable to give her true status as a wife and mother of his children.  Some scholars say that David was gone 14 years as the feud between himself and Saul raged on.   We know that he took other wives during this period.  We know that he often was close enough to Saul to kill him.  Surely at some point he might have attempted to rescue Michal.  David was a man of legend in his battles and his ability to escape Saul and his armies.  Michal must have heard of his later marriages and of his rescuing his two wives from the Amalekites (1Samuel 30).  She must have wondered when he would attempt to rescue her, too?  I would think that hope grew less and less as the years passed by. In the meantime, there is Michal with no real marriage from which to draw comfort.  Oral tradition states that she raised the five sons of Merab after her sister's death, but they were not her own children.  At some point they would have been returned to their own father, where their inheritance lay.  Surely raising those boys brought her some joy but also heartache when they were returned to their father.    I'll wager that Paltiel had other wives.  He was a Prince after all.  He would require male heirs.  But it was not Michal who would provide those.  It would appear that Michal was always going to be without the very things that might bring a woman fulfillment.Eventually Saul dies in battle.  His son Ish-bosheth is named King.  Abner, an advisor to Saul takes over as counsel for Ish-bosheth.  Ish-bosheth however accuses Abner of a moral crime he has not committed.  Abner then aligns himself with David.  David agrees to enter Israel as King but tells Abner his price, \"Return to me my wife Michal for whom I paid 200 foreskins.\" (2Samuel 3).  Paltiel follows behind Michal weeping loudly all the way.  No word is made of Michal's feelings.  We know that she returned to her rightful place as the wife of David.  We can gain only a little inside information about her emotional state.   The Bible refers to her as 'Saul's daughter' from this point onward.  Her status is due only her relationship to her father.  No personal desire on David's part prompted him to demand her return.  It was merely one more political move.  Still, he would be king.  Michal too had learned to calculate position.  As a daughter of Saul, she was returning to Israel as Queen.But the intervening years had done her damage.  She'd faced the reality that she would not be first in David's affections.  She faced his other wives.  She might have been the first wife, she might even have been queen, but she was not a beloved wife of anyone, but Paltiel who had denied her a wife's rights of affection.   Each of these other women had children by David.  She, Michal, had nothing but her status as Saul's daughter.  She leaned hard on that identity.Michal faced these realities, and her heart was hardened within her by disappointments and rejections.  As so often happens when we are hurt, she focused her self-loathing and lack of status on the one person who remained in her life, David, the last person who caused her harm.   I am not letting David off from his part in this.  He was a grown man.  He'd learned what loss was.  He'd learned to love.  He'd learned what rejection felt like.  Any of these circumstances should have aroused compassion in him for Michal, but it did not.   She was a possession, a right that had been taken from him and he wanted her back for that fact alone.  And that, I'm afraid, was what sealed Michal's identity forever.When Michal saw David, scantily clothed, acting as a shepherd boy might have acted before the ark of the Lord rather than the way she felt an earthly King should, 'she despised him in her heart' (I Chronicles 15:29).   She not only despised him but when he appeared in the household ready to give them the Lord's blessing, she greeted him with a scathing and accusing tone. Scripture tells us that she mentions how he has exposed himself before the maidservants (2 Samuel 6).  Jewish oral tradition says she went on remarking how she nor her father would have acted in such a way before all the public. She accused David of seeking the sexual admiration of both other women and of men.  She was harsh and ugly in her jealous criticism.David is righteously angry.  He replies that his joy was in the Lord God.  What she saw as a humbling and humiliation of David the King he saw as high praise for the King of All and furthermore he would humble and humiliate himself willingly in future for the same.   It is unknown if bitterness of heart prevented her having children or if David put her away from himself, never calling upon her to perform the duties of a wife.      What we do know is only what scripture shares in the final verse of 2 Samuel 6:23 \"So Michal, the daughter of Saul, remained childless all the days of her life.\"Michal might have been redeemed.  She might have been known as the wife of David, instead of the daughter of Saul.  She might have accepted this new role in life and seen it as an opportunity to step into an era of grace, but it was her past hurts and rejections which she allowed to rule her emotions and to become her identity.  And in so choosing her place in history is that of a bitter and angry woman.  But then she might be any of us, hadn't she?  I think women tend to lose sight of who they are, to lose identity.  That's because we tend to identify with our circumstances.  I am a wife to John, a beloved wife.    I am a beloved mother by my children.  I am a writer and a homemaker and a frustrated gardener.  I am limited by physical abilities and artistic inabilities.   I might identify with negative things such as anxieties and insecurities and rejections.   But none of that is all of who I am.   We focus on our earthly identity which is often bound by circumstances or robbed from us by others.  Things over which we've no control dictate who we come to identify ourselves to be.   Often in our quest to discover who we are, we forget that we are always daughters of the most high King. We are always a child of God.  And in the end that is all we are truly called to be."},
{"title": "This Week In My Home: Let's Get Busy!", "date": null, "text": "Our kitchen for this week is right out of the Art Deco era this one from 1935.  You'll likely recognize that soft yellow on the walls as a color we often come across in that era of kitchen.  This one is a little more creamy, but it's still a soft yellow.First thing I want to address is the floor.  Do you see how the pattern was set so that the lines are coming right at us.  It makes the room look BIG.  The kitchen is bigger than some we've seen of late.I'm going to the dinette first.  Do note that black rug that grounds the chrome and vinyl set and makes a clear boundary for where the breakfast nook might is.  Also notice that the yellow chair cushions and the yellow in the nook above where china is stored are the same color.  It's a clever way of drawing the eye up to that shelving.  The orange plaid curtains appeal to me.  I think orange and yellow are a lovely compliment to one another and always have done.Now let us stop at the telephone table.  There appears to be a mirror there and I can only assume it's to be used as well for a quick check of hair or lipstick if someone comes to the door.We'll go on around that telephone table and here we are at the stove.  There appears to be free standing cabinets set up either side of it.  I do wonder though if there is a cupboard or storage on the bottom back side of that dividing wall?  What do you think?There also appears to be a storage bin for pots and pans/lids and such on the cabinet nearest the window next to the stove on the right hand side. The sink is one of those big huge cast iron babies with drainboards on both sides.  I LOVE those sort of sinks, I do truly. It's well placed there on the wall with the window above, the stove to the left and the other wall of cabinets to the right.   That wall appears to be built in cupboards and counters.  That should be ample storage for our kitchen, I would think.  Work:  I enjoyed my week 'off'.   Yes, meals got made and so did the bed. Floors a got swept each day and the place was tidied....but it wasn't all my own place!  You see, we went off for a short time and visited St. Augustine.  We left Sunday morning and came back on Friday evening.   We left the house all neat and clean and simply relaxed.  It was good to get away and good to come home again.   This week sees the end of April...I think every month has flown by except possibly January which seemed to linger on and on.  We're looking more like summer here than ever and now the danger of frost is past I can think about planting flowers and seeds.  I can't wait to get started on it all!We'll need to make a trip to the grocery store this week. I must have milk which I don't like to buy locally.  I really dislike the taste of that brand.   We'll need a handful of fresh items.  Mostly though, I'm just getting by with a few purchases.  I'm going to push hard for waiting until after May 1 before we do a big shop.One goal I had for this month that I have done nothing towards: buy charcoal, bug sprays, paper plates, sun screen etc.  I would like to start on getting those supplies.Get the bedrooms dressed for Spring/Summer and get the pillow covers made for the living room.  zone 4 work:  Clean the porches properly.   Especially the back porch.  The floor and rafters and railings all need a good cleaning.   And I'd really like to stop and think hard about what to do with the patio.  It is prime real estate for pots of flowers and such but I want it to be pretty and have some sort of seating, as well.  So that's something to think about.This will also involve coaxing John to get the dryer off the back porch.  I've no clue what he means to do with the washer but I did make room in my shed for the dryer.  I will not offer up more of my shed than that.  I'm pretty sure he could put both in his second shed if he only would.  I'll lobby for it...Kitchen:  This week I haven't any leftovers to gather but I will be looking over the expired items box and going over the freezers to see what I might need to address using.  I'll post the meal plans separately and will go a little more in depth this week and  share  breakfast/lunch and snacks in addition to dinners.I would also like to get that pantry and freezer inventoried this week.  I don't have any big cleaning jobs indoors so I should be able to tackle that.  It will be a good time to insure I've not got a bunch of stuff expiring again.   I don't recall much that was going to expire before autumn from my last inventory but it's good to keep an eye on things.Not much else to report for the week ahead in this section so I'll move on.Leisure:I will not be as leisurely this week as I got to be last week and that's quite all right.  However, the quiet reading time and just sitting thinking times were so deeply nourishing that I am going to truly try hard to limit my computer  daily rather than just sitting down and being mindless with it.    I also want to focus on reading more.  I remember when I read a book every day and couldn't wait to take it up again.  I'm just as interested in reading now and when I actively choose a book and choose to read it, I really come out of it feeling relaxed and centered and restored.  I haven't touched genealogy in a few weeks and I do have some things I'd like to do.  That's how I've planned my week.   What are your plans?"},
{"title": "Over The Fence:  The Things  We Learn", "date": null, "text": "One day I shall find a nice set of vintage ads or pictures to share with this post.  Right now it's a painful thing to look for anything with fences in it.  I'm sure I'll come across something if I stop trying to search for it.  So far I've had the option of a man leaping a fence his neighbor is painting to get to the beer sitting on the picnic table nearby,  a scantily clad young woman with the oddly named 'fence' net hose (instead of the more common fishnet) and a lot of photos of fences taken in someone's gardens.  I'm a little leery of using a photo that is someone's real home.  I'd rather it was a photo set or illustrated...I've a confession to make.  There will be no Homemaker Diary this week because I haven't written one just yet.  I know, it looks very remiss of me but  you'll understand  and forgive me I'm sure.  I promise I'll have one for you next week.  In the meantime, let's have a neighborly chat over the fence shall we?I unwittingly touched a nerve in my own life and that of others when I mentioned the anxiety of being a latch key child.  We lived in the country for all but one year of my latch key years and we had no near neighbors.  I didn't know how to call Mama, Daddy, or anyone save Granny (Tilden 4282 was her phone number).  She and Granddaddy had only one car and they lived here in Reynolds, and we lived some 30 minutes away. I daresay in a real emergency though she'd have been able to contact Mama or the sheriff or someone had I called but I admit at 7 I wasn't adept at using a phone nor was I encouraged to use it.  It was, as with so many other things, a gap in my education that some adult ought to have thought to help with but didn't.  These were the days well before cell phones or 911.    For six years I was responsible for my brothers and myself.  I was expected to also clear up the dishes from breakfast and to start supper heating on the stove.  Not onerous tasks I know but it added to my sense of feeling unsure of myself because I was out of my depth.   There were so many uncertainties.    We weren't alone that long but it felt like a long time.  And then there were the rare days when we were suddenly sent home early for weather warnings and such that meant longer times at home alone.Oddly, in later years when we might have gone home alone after school, daddy put his foot down and demanded that Mama pick us up at school each day.  We sat in the car in the parking lot at her workplace each school day until she got off.  Summers were another story.   We were home alone for about 8 hours.  Mama called to check on us but also to discuss what I might make for supper each day and to instruct us in what she expected us to do but mostly we were unsupervised and unchecked.  There were neighbor houses within a little walking distance but like our own parents they worked and weren't home. By this time, my brothers were less inclined to bow to the authority of the oldest child regardless of who made her boss and there were difficult days that often ended with me being upbraided for their misdeeds after spending a day quarreling with them.  I think part of the anxiety too was that our being home alone made Daddy anxious.  He didn't want us to open the doors to knocks, or be out in the yard in case  a stranger came along and realized we were home alone especially way out in the country.   He saw dangers everywhere and we children felt his anxieties.   Some days when he came home from work he'd be upset and angry when he came in.  I could put it down to sheer bad temper in Mama, but not Daddy.  He'd worked himself into a state worrying on his way home.   Not to say that Daddy was the better parent and Mama the careless one.  But I do honestly believe he felt the strain of our being home alone as much as we did.    I am not by any means feeling sorry for myself nor faulting my mom.  All she ever wanted to be was a nurse and what's the point if you're stuck at home with a bunch of children?   Being a mom was secondary to her.  Again, I'm not faulting her.  This was the reality of our lives and while I longed with all my heart not to be the responsible one, I understood even in my younger years that what she did was important to her.  Coming home to be with us wasn't on her options list.  I was quite earnest in my desire to avoid that with my own children, though there was a time when they were latchkey kids out of necessity.  I was especially blessed in that situation  because we lived on a quiet dead end street in town  that was just packed with modest little houses and very pleasant neighbors who kept an eye on the three older kids (aged 16, 13, and 9) and several were available most days if any issue should arise.   My children well knew how to use a phone to call for help.  I worked only a bit over a mile away from the house.  I had Katie in a good  day care for those years.And yet, I hated every single minute of it.  That situation kept up for about 2 years then John was home most days (he began EMS as a tech and worked nights).  Later, after we'd moved here,  John worked nights and I worked days.  He went to paramedic school in the evenings.   Sometimes he had to make up time at work because of school and eventually he had to work rotations on weekends at other facilities in order to earn all the credits he needed to take the test.  My job kept me from home from  7am until 8pm some days.  The kids were in school then and got home about 4pm.  But Amie  was 17 and I felt she was old enough to watch the two younger children for a few hours each day.  I made it a paid babysitting job for her.  Granny was just a few hundred yards  away and they all knew how to call me at work.  My brother's wife came in from work at the time the bus arrived and picked them up to bring them home and she was only as far away as Granny on our other side.  Still, I was a 30 minute drive away and that bothered me.When Amie was graduating and wanted to get a 'real' job,  I knew things had to change.  We looked for  day care  in this county (none) for the summer months ahead and for day care in my work county. Then there was the next school year to consider .  Out of county school tuition and day care in the area where I worked and the cost of someone to come stay with Sam and Katie each afternoon, etc.  The job just wouldn't support any of those options, though it was a  good job.   It was more than clear that I should be home with the kids and so we made it happen.     There was one particularly tight financial period about 2 years in when we began to discuss my going to work once more.   I shall never forget Samuel coming to John saying \"I know how bad things are right now but please don't send Mama back to work.  Katie needs her to be here.  I've got my summer job and I can find another and I'll give you all I make.\"   John looked at me and said \"Apparently you need to be here...\" and he told Sam \"Thank you for making the offer but we'll get through this.  You've helped us make the decision we needed to make.\"   Again, I'm not saying my choice was better than that others made.  In the end, we made the right choice for us, for our family and that's about the best thing anyone can do.  I didn't plan to always be at home, though I confess I had no particular career desires.  I liked being a homemaker.  When Katie left home, I asked John if he wanted me to look for a job.  I wasn't keen, mind you, but I felt it only fair after all our years of living on a budget to at least offer.   By that time we'd paid off our home.  He  said \"How can I afford for you to work?!  All the stuff you do to save us money wouldn't get done and we'd be bound by your job schedule and mine...No, I think you belong at home.\"  I didn't argue with the man.  I was just grateful he'd seen the value of having me here.And to be fair to us both, I did work hard at making home my job.  John's been talking a lot lately about Purpose and Calling.  He's read books by a pastor he enjoys and  watched sermons by another who are explaining it all.  He's convinced he has had no calling on his life and is debating whether he has purpose.    Listening to him, I've questioned my own calling and purpose but I can say assuredly that all of my life long I wanted just five things: I wanted to learn to read.  I can remember just aching with the need to read words on pages.   I tackled that in first grade and never looked back.  I wanted a  a good  husband and family who loved me dearly.  I wanted my own home.   I wanted to write.  I spent many years in my 20's through my 50's feeling I'd missed out on something, hadn't achieved much, pitied myself for the ways in which I'd had to make do with what came my way or with which I'd gone without.  I shake my head right now in wonder at that foolish woman.  And please don't think she's too far off because she tends to pop in now and then even yet! Right now, in this moment, I can say most sincerely that I'm glad it all happened as it did.    Would I have given up reading?  No!  It's carried me to lands I'll never travel to in this lifetime.  It taught me history and fed me spiritually and transported me in some of the more heartbreaking days to a better place.  It shaped me in ways I couldn't even see, giving me life lessons I might have missed otherwise.Home, I've discovered, is more than just the house you live in or the place you came from.   Home is something that is in the very heart of you and you carry it with you.  Some people, some women, only ever live in a house but there are others like myself who have a knack of making a home wherever they are.  I've made a home in a hospital room and home in rundown houses and home with next to no furniture.  I take no credit for this trait in myself.  It was born in me.  I can only assume that reading helped to cultivate it because I loved reading of how others made home.Could I have given up my family?  Now there's a question I'll have to answer truthfully.  When my first marriage was ending, I considered it.  It's not something I say with pride.  I was in a sad and sorry place and I couldn't see light at the end of the tunnel.    I earned little, their father earned a good deal more.  I wondered how I'd care for my two children on my own and whether I could do so emotionally as well as physically.  As well,   I'd listened too hard to people who assured me I wasn't the mother I ought to be, both family and friend, who seemed to always see a need for improvement in me.  There were no brownie points being handed out for doing your best.  It was a constant criticism that wore down my confidence.  And too, there was a part of me that wanted to claim that freedom I'd never known as a teen and young adult. I felt I'd always been taking care of someone my whole life long.  I was mentally and emotionally exhausted from fighting depression for years upon years, too.  Did I have enough left in me to spare to love my children sufficiently, too? I'm being very real here with you all.  I used to daydream of just fading away.  I don't mean running away so that I could ever be found but of fading into nothingness.  Not ever having been.   But life had a grip on me and I would not end it myself, though I often thought of it.  I'll tell why one day, but not today.  This is about something else entirely and that is the sense of exhaustion and utter overwhelm a parent can feel when they're doing it all and getting blasted from all sides despite trying so very hard. I went through these things in the same season when my marriage was failing hard.   Then my husband was called up for duty in the Gulf War and I was left alone with the kids.   I discovered that without the mental and emotional strain of beating on the chest of a very dead marriage, I was enough as a parent.  I didn't go hang out with my friends.  I worked.   I came home to my children.  We were enough together.   I learned I could manage financially and provide for my family, too.   And then, then...when I'd learned so much about myself that I'd never known, I was hit by the drunk driver on my way to work one morning.  I was in the hospital for 2 weeks and in a rehab hospital for 6 or so, and my children God only knows where while I did all I could to be improved enough to go home to them, I had the agonizing experience of living without those kids. I didn't see them or hear their voices on the phone.    I wept at night with the deepest, most sincere yearning.  I called every friend I could asking if they knew where my children were. If I called my husband, he said they were with this person or that.   I've never known such a deep absence in my life.  I knew then that if I had to go through hell, I'd never let them go again if I could possibly find them.And so I was right back to what I believe I'd ever wanted to be: a mother.  I knew it without a doubt.It's true you know.  What we call catastrophe, what we call horrible, tragedy...They are all just words that really mean opportunity.   It was as if God was giving me  insight into myself.In all those weeks that my husband was gone for active duty, I never missed him.  I found life, even though it consisted only of work and home, was full and satisfying.    But when my children were nowhere to be found... I learned what yearning truly is.  What I wouldn't have given to hear my children's voice on the phone, to have listened to them share their  day at school, to hug and kiss them  a dozen times, to fuss over them and to fuss at them, to have the opportunity to be Mama!The hard things were not over and done.  No they were not. I was on the road to who I was going to become.  Mistakes were still ahead to be made.  And I made them, oh I made them!   I make them still.But now and then I'd get something incredibly right.  I had Katie.   She was solely mine... I was done with men, I knew that for sureGod apparently had other plans.... I met John, after years of living near one another but not knowing each other. We talked and talked and talked our way through more hours of time than I ever imagined possible.  In just two weeks,  I knew without any doubt that whatever mistakes I'd made in my personal life in the past, this man would never be one of them.  Six weeks later we'd progressed to the point of talking of marriage and he moved in with me eight weeks after we'd talked in my office.  30 years later I can say that I regret nothing.  I won't tell you he was perfect.  No, nor was I.  Together we've done a whole lot of growing.  We've been through things as a couple and we've been through spells where we went through some hard  things all alone and the other could only stand patiently by...We've had fun and we've worked hard.  We've lived our way through a real marriage. Only John ever knew of my dream to write.  I never told anyone else, but the internet came into my life and here I am.  You see where the desire to write has gotten me.  I'll spare you another long story for which I'm sure you'll thank me.I've taken time this month to share what I've learned financially over the years.  Some of you have shared similar stories, or harder ones, and I know that those journeys taught you much as they mine taught me.  I've learned from my childhood experiences and from my teen and adult years.  I've learned from every relationship in my life, be it a relationship with a person or with less tangible things like money and fear.   Not all lessons are big ones.  Some are small ones but the small lessons add to our experiences, too.  Some lessons are just hard.  They're hard to go through and hard to review but they teach us just like the less hard ones do.Well time I stopped chatting and got busy.  Shabat will be here soon.  And then we'll rest..."},
{"title": "Changing the Financial Mindset Part II", "date": null, "text": "I left off in my story where I, as a single mom, proudly paid John back every penny he paid out on my behalf in that year of unemployment.  But I was by no means the smartest thing financially at that point in my life, and I'd be remiss not to share the 'Rest of the Story' as the late Paul Harvey used to say.John was the sort of man who always had a big jar of change hanging around and a little cash tucked away and there were times during that season of unemployment when he'd tell me to take some of that to go by the necessary extra milk and bread or a pair of shoes for Katie.  That was a revelation to me, what it meant to have cash on hand.  I never had had any, and indeed during that first year of our relationship the cable got turned off Super Bowl weekend because I didn't have enough money to buy a stamp.  I had the check in hand but no money for a stamp and rather than ask him to buy one, I did without.  I was foolish.  The cost to have the service reconnected was 200 times what a stamp cost back then.We had quite a few words over that.  I felt I was in the right at the time until I had to pay that reconnect fee.  What a silly lesson I'd set myself to learn!Life went on.  We both worked decent jobs, and John bought one car and we financed another.  We were slowly but steadily improving.  The day came when we were ready to look for a home of our own and we diligently began the search, viewing houses, looking at land and at doublewides.  Mama had been given half the land of Granny's place and she agreed to sell us 1 acre.  I was over the moon.  It took (through no fault of hers) over 8 months to get the deed.  When we had the deed in hand I discovered we had quite a few acres more, about 9 in total.We began to eagerly search for a doublewide to put on the property.  We finally found the one we wanted and we were approved for the loan and we began the process.    I was so excited about the house but goodness all the ancillary things that had to come with it were costly.   Well, septic system, drain field for the septic tank, land to be cleared, a driveway to be made, electric poles and running connection to electricity and phone lines, someone to dig a water line and on and on it seemed to go.   We had quite a few small loans when we started getting this place together, plus a car and a house payment and rent, too!   At that time, I was working with a friend and was rolling in money and I mean that quite seriously.   He had his own business and was in the height of his busy season.  I was paid a commission for every appointment and getting an appointment set was easy peasy during that time.   I paid off loans as quick as I could and in the end, besides the house and car payments, we had only the loan on the well to keep paying when the hot streak on the job ended and I found myself receiving two Bass for two weeks of work...Unfortunately my car didn't run on fish and when the next pay period came and went with only one fish for pay, John insisted it was time to quit  and find a 'real' job, at least one that paid out in proper checks at the end of the pay period!So I moved into a new job and eventually left that job as I explained in an earlier post, because someone needed to take care of children at home.  Now here's where the next hard financial lessons came in.  Though I'd saved us money in reducing the car insurance, things had to change on other fronts.  Leaving home at 7am and not getting in until 8p often meant we'd relied on whatever shopping I had done that evening for a meal, or we'd bring home takeout.   I had to learn all over again how to shop for groceries and how to make what we bought last.   I wasn't at the same level of frugal I am now where I think nothing of making bread...I was still at the stage where the cheapest I could buy was the best I could do.  One thing about living here and not working out of town was that there was NO fast food option or delivery. Amie got a job about 40 minutes from home.  I drove her to work, came home and drove back to pick her up and bring her home.  This went on for roughly seven days a week with hours that often meant I was out of bed and home around 5am and picking her up as soon as the children were in off the bus that afternoon.  During those days, I often ran out of some needed item in the grocery department.  Not ice cream or chips but milk or eggs or bread.  There were days I was so weary.   And if I ran in to get milk and eggs or bread there were invariably impulse items or frozen food items that were meant to ease my weariness and help me get a meal on the table...Or fast food since I was in two towns with lots of options.John was paying all the bills in those days and I still wasn't carrying any cash or even a check with me.   Our bank finally insisted we get debit cards.  They were very savvy about it.  They CHARGED us each month for NOT having one and using it.  For me, it was like turning a child loose with a box of matches.  Suddenly, I had ready money on me.  Not only that, I had a means of spending that John couldn't check up on and fuss over.  Because he didn't check the bank statement and we couldn't access our account online, and no checks were gone from the register he had no clue I might have bought an extra $10-$30 worth of groceries that week.  At first I kept up with it and made sure it got entered in the checkbook, in a sort of Rob Peter to Pay Paul scenario.  It came out of my grocery budget but it came from the next week's...So I started that week with a deficit and at the end of that pay period, I was borrowing off the next week's.That became a very slippery slope.   Over a couple of years time, I neatly and quietly overspent our account by about $2500.    The balance that John had patiently and diligently built up over the years was eaten away almost entirely.  Every now and then I'd get a gift of money or earn a tiny bit or save my pitiful little allowance and I'd throw it all at the balance and cut groceries super hard and I'd start to rebuild it.  But then we wouldn't have something necessary and I'd be out of budget and I'd fall right back into my bad habit of buy now and answer for it later.I won't tell you I did this without my conscience eating me up.  No indeed.  This began a period of time when I lived on the adrenaline of anxiety in overdrive.  I would wake at night filled with dread. I lay awake nights and planned how I could repay the account.  I thought about it all day long. I was obsessed with 'finding' money to throw at that sunken balance.At one point, Mama suggested we take a trip with my niece and Katie.  We'd go into the mountains and enjoy a two day trip.  I agreed far too quickly for what could only have been misery.  Mama and my niece have as dysfunctional a relationship as I have with her and mine alone was reason enough to say \"No thank you.\"  But the idea of escaping the troubles I'd created for even two days was so appealing.  Providentially, the bank statement arrived the day before we left.  I tucked it away, secure in the fact that John, who never looked at it anyway, wouldn't pick it up and learn the cold hard facts.  The room we stayed in overlooked a main street and right directly in front of the bed and breakfast was a branch of my bank.  Misery filled me every single time I dared glance at that window or we left that B&B...I hadn't gotten away from my troubles at all.  They were with me where ever I went.About a month later, John and I went to the bank to conduct some business and we were sitting in the officer's office when he casually asked her \"How much is in the account?  About $xxxx...\" and she looked at him and laughed and said \"$xxx.\"  He said \"You sure?\" and when she said \"Yes\", he didn't say a word but I could see the climax had arrived. I took a slip of paper and wrote on it, \"It's true....please don't say anything just now.\"  He read the note and put it in his pocket.Can you imagine?  Can you?  Neither can I now.  My ears and cheeks burn remembering how stupid I'd been, how much I was willing to risk for an extra gallon of milk here or a bag of produce there or a stupid frozen pizza.  At no point was it his fault, nor were we about to go hungry.  It was just that I still lived in the land of dread of  fussing over money and rather than say I needed or wanted those extra  things, I'd stupidly and blindly  put myself into a situation that risked everything instead of facing my old fears and wrestling the damned things down.What happened?Once in the car, away from any witnesses, I made a complete confession.  \"I did it.  It started out small and got out of hand and I couldn't catch it up no matter how I tried.\"   \"WHY didn't you tell me?   Why couldn't you say, \"I can't manage on this budget.\" ?\"   I hung my head and said \" I thought you'd leave me...\"   Only my absolute misery convinced him I was telling the truth.  And yes, that's how sick my mind own mind was in regards to money.  It was stronger than a marriage...  I added \"I'm turning over my debit card.  I'm never touching the checkbook again!  I'm no good with money, I'm just not and it's not fair to us...\"   And that's when my husband yelled at me.  He pulled over to the side of the road and yelled \"What?!  You think I'd let you off that easy?  No!  You're going to learn to handle money and handle it well!   What kind of husband would I be if I didn't teach you to take care of yourself?!\"I'd always been with John when it was bill paying time.  It wasn't a one man affair but now he actively involved me.  We discussed, and we 'discussed' if you know what I mean, why I'd spent money where I did and what I bought when I spent.  I hated every single minute of it.  It was a rare day not to burst into tears on bill paying nights.  Not because I hoped to manipulate him around to my way of thinking but because of my sheer frustration and absolute dread of having to explain myself.   But there were positives as well.  I began to see clearly that there were areas we might improve upon, areas I'd never before dealt with.  \"Why can't we divide annual fees into monthly payments and set the money aside that way?\", I'd ask.  \"Then savings wouldn't have to be touched...\"  \"Why can't we start writing down charges from the gas and credit card as though they were already gone?\"   John would look at me and say, \"We can try...\" and we found those things worked.  When he complained that some item he wanted wasn't in the cupboard I'd point out that my budget was gone.  I'd offer him the option of waiting until next pay period or going to buy it now.     When I wanted to do a little shopping now and then of the non-grocery kind, it was John who suggested I start a \"shopping fund\".   We agreed on a discretionary spending limit of $50 each.  No fussing over sums under $50 but asking each other before we spent more than $50.  We also agreed upon a cash allowance and I did leave debit and credit cards and checkbook at home and when my cash was gone it was gone.  Mama wanted someone to clean her house and I offered to take the job. I cleaned her house twice a month.  Half the money was mine to do with what I willed and the other half was used for groceries or household necessities.And then one day, John didn't feel like tending to the bills.  \"Can't you just do it tonight?\" he asked.  So I sat down and made out checks and paid the bills and totaled up the checkbook all on my own.  Due to his job hours, it became easier on paydays for him to simply deposit his check and then call me to tell me how much it was.  When he came in from work, the bills were done.  I took great pride in showing him how I'd saved little sums here and there that added up to bigger sums.  He didn't just blindly turn it over to me.  No indeed.  For this I'm glad.  Our bank progressed to online statements and he checks the balance pretty regularly.  He sometimes asks \"Who did you write that check to?  Why is this sum of money going out?\"  But the confrontational scenes between us decreased dramatically over the years because I had learned.And the proudest day of my life came when he told someone, \"I used to wonder how Terri would fare if anything happened to me, but I'm so proud that she's learned to take care of herself.  She can go toe to toe with anyone she's gotten so smart about our money!\"There are months when it feels like our funds are water and I can't hold onto them no matter how I try.  We've just been through such a season of time. I was talking to John about it yesterday.  He nodded in understanding, but we both knew there was nothing I could have done to hold on to it.  What was spent was necessary.   We've had to put money into mower parts and cars and plumbing and appliance needs. We've had unexpected bills and unexpected increases in expenses.  But we're weathering the storm with a decent balance under us still and not touching our savings (though stimulus money did help prevent that!).I'm not perfect. I still struggle at trying to keep to a grocery budget.  We could perhaps get by with less than what I spend, however I do more than I've ever done to save money and John clearly sees that.  We've been spending roughly the same amount now for the past ten years and each time prices increase I find a new way to save so we can stay near the budget we mean to keep.There are days when I want to just walk into a store and shop for the sheer pleasure of buying something new.  I want new things for my home to replace some of the worn out things we have.  I want...but I know that what we have is what we have and with patience something new will eventually be mine.  I've learned to appreciate most that what we have is OURS.  No one can ever have cause to walk into my home and demand I give up anything new I do have.  I remember that happening when I was a child of 3.  Men walked into our house and took out all the nice new furnishings my parents had.  Yes, and Daddy lost his job, too, because you weren't reliable if you'd gone into bankruptcy in those days.And yes, if John were to go before I, I know now that I can truly manage on my own.  I know to play for keeps with my financial standing and not to be foolish.One last thing. I 've shared this testimony before and I'll keep sharing it because some one of you is not being truthful with your partner or spouse.  You've dug yourselves into a hole and you're sick of living the lie.  I don't know how or why you are there.  I do know that you have every desire to change.Start with a confession.  Don't want until your other half finds out on their own as I did.  John is an exceptional man but I did hurt the trust between us.  I urge you to STOP what you're doing and come clean.  If that is absolutely not possible and I do realize that some situations won't be helped with a confession then STOP the behavior and get yourself square.  Go find a financially responsible person you can trust, who you will allow to hold you accountable,  who will help you to find ways out of the situation you've gotten yourself into.  Learn to budget wisely and stick to it.  Earn extra money if you must. You can live free of this tangled mess you've gotten yourself into.  You can."},
{"title": "Worth Sharing: Fiesta!", "date": null, "text": "Until the 1930s, most dinnerware was sold in full pre-determined sized sets and still followed a traditional Victorian pattern of a common pattern on all pieces.   But in 1936, Home Laughlin introduced a new line of semi-vitreous dishware in a less formal more Art Deco inspired shape that featured concentric circles.  This line was revolutionary in that it was solid colored.  It was not the first solid colored dinnerware marketed but it was the first that was mass produced for the U.S. markets.  The line was first introduced at the 1936 Annual Pottery and Glass exhibit in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania in January of that year.  The dishes were designed by Frederick Hurten Rheade.   The dishes were affordable, could be purchased as sets of four, six or eight or as open stock pieces.  This appealed to American homemakers.  I can see the appeal.  There's nothing quite so disheartening as having one of a set of four plates break...The ability to replace or even recreate would be a huge bonus.When initially introduced the dishware line 37 different pieces which expanded to a line of 64.  This included platters for serving in various sizes, vases in various sizes, pitchers, divided relish plates, candle holders, an ash tray, and a nesting set of mixing bowls.  I think we can guess that this might have included some decorative items like the Roosters that grace the top of the china cupboard in this week's picture.  Eventually some of these items such as the mixing bowls were discontinued in the early 1940's but in the expansion of the line more items were added.The color line was meant to be cheerful and bright.  So much was being done in those days to brighten the lives of those most deeply affected by the Depression years.  I certainly like the colors myself.  The colors originally produced included Red (red orange in color), Blue (called Cobalt but actually was the lighter blue featured in the kitchen I featured this week.  I've inserted that photo above so you can easily reference the colors).  Green (a light green), Yellow (deep golden color), and Old Ivory (a yellowish cream).  In 1938 Home Laughlin China added Turquoise ( a Robin's Egg Blue).In WWII, with war production demanding so much of the manufacturing processes, the line was reduced to about one third it's size.  For a full decade Fiesta Ware remained popular with middle class families.   The line continued to be produced until 1969, but before 1944 the color Red was dropped from the line.  The dishes began to drop in popularity in the post war years and many larger serving pieces were discontinued during this time.During the housing boom of the 1950's following the War, the Homer Laughlin Company added four new more modern colors.  Only the Turquoise and Yellow from the 1930s remained.  The colors introduced were Rose (a dark pinkish brown), Gray (medium color), Forest (dark green) and Chartreuse (bright yellowish green).  In 1959, these four colors were discontinued and the company re-introduced the original red and a new green (medium green) as well as the turquoise and yellow offered since the 1930s.  The color line was reduced from six colors to four at that time in order to try and limit the costs and wait for an increase in sales once more.  However, sales continued to slow and decrease through the 1960's.In an attempt to save the line, pieces were redesigned. Finials topped serving pieces, handles were put on cups, bowls were changed and shapes of dishes changed in an effort to Modernize pieces.  The company reduced the colors offered to three with the five major serving pieces offered in only one color.  Colors offered in the 1960's were Red (called Mango Red), Turf Green (Avocado) and Antique Gold (harvest gold).   They even renamed the line as Fiesta Ironstone.   It was not enough.  In 1973, the line was discontinued.Suddenly, Fiesta Ware grew in popularity.  People were seeking out pieces and buying them in quantity from antique and thrift stores.  A secondary market of collectors grew.   New homeowners found the pieces desirable.  Homer Laughlin Company took note.  13 years after ceasing production they reintroduced the line with new colors in 1986.  These included Rose (pink), Black, White (Stark white), Cobalt (deep cobalt blue) and Apricot (a pinkish tan).   This color line expanded to 39 colors and later to a line of specialty colors.  In 2009 the company introduced square shaped dishes.  In 2016 the company discontinued the square mug and square bowl from the line.In 2020 Homer Laughlin China was acquired by a new company.   The new company was then renamed Fiesta Tableware and continues to manufacture these colorful dishes today."},
{"title": "In My Home This Week:  Strictly Routine", "date": null, "text": "This kitchen is called the \"Fiesta Ware\" kitchen, named for the colorful pottery dishes.  I love how the accents in the room also contain those colors and so does the floor tile.  I'll tell you all about Fiesta Ware in a moment, but I think it safe to say that this kitchen was designed in the latter part of the 1930's, since Fiesta Ware hit the market in 1936.The kitchen truly is a testament to the chinaware for which it was named.  It was meant to be bright, open, cheerful and highly functional though compact.  Affordable would be a key word to use with this kitchen, something it also drew from the Fiesta Ware line that inspired it.Armstrong was known for it's use of cork in it's line of flooring and here we see Cork used as the neutral backdrop to allow all the other colors to pop.   Honestly?  I'm not a fan.  I don't like the walls and cabinets all being cork colored.  I'd much prefer a pale soft yellow or even that deep pretty blue used on the stool and chair for cabinets or even the same bright white as the stove, but I'll just bet the idea was that this color would 'hide' dirty splatters and fingerprints.  I've yet to meet the material that does, just saying.Criticism aside, let me share my views of this kitchen.   I expect that tall stool to the left is meant to be used at stove or sink...or so I'll guess since I can see no other purpose for it's being in the room.  I'm guessing it's likely the refrigerator is on the back porch and there's a 'service' door there on that end of the kitchen.  I note that the countertops here also utilize tile.  In this instance it appears to be the same cork color.  I honestly can say I don't mind it half so much on the counter tops.  I think it's the pattern on the walls that is putting me off.  There appears to be a decent amount of storage on either side of the stove and work surface as well.  I like that there is a vent in this kitchen.  It would be key in removing cooking orders and I think it's likely a good thing, because if we temporarily look at the dining table it seems to be seating for 8.  I take that to mean that this room serves as a dining area as well, as it's unlikely anyone would put a table for 8 in the kitchen otherwise.Back to the working part of the kitchen area, I like that window there near the sink and stove.  I'll just bet any breeze there is welcome when the weather is warm, not to mention the natural light in daytime when one is most likely working in the kitchen anyway.Again in this week's kitchen we see that slightly higher counter above the kitchen sink.  I'm beginning to realize that this is a mighty clever thing.   For one, unless people are standing directly in front of that counter and peering over, any messy dishes can't be seen.  I've often thought that the greatest disservice we women have done is accept a completely open kitchen area.  You've nowhere to hide the mess dinner has made.  You're sitting there attempting to chat with guests and, if you're like me, your eyes will drift towards that piled high sink or the cluttered counter a dozen times.What's more that high counter is actually a built in china cabinet.  Just look at all the storage.  There's display room for the pretty Fiesta Ware pieces and it appears that the far end has a cabinet door so one might put the other necessary but not quite as pretty items behind it.   And at the end we see best, there is a whole row of drawers of various sizes.  Just think of having the silverware and serving pieces handy in those drawers.  I'll wager that deeper bottom drawer holds tablecloths or dishtowels.Now that we've gotten back around to the dining table, note how the chairs are painted various shades.  Now look at the windows.  I'm suspecting that subtly painted floral design is on a bamboo shade.  The window wells are painted the same lovely  blue as the stool and the one chair we can see and if you enlarge the picture you'll see the shelves in the china cabinet are painted blue as well.Look for a post about the iconic Fiesta Ware tomorrow.  It was really interesting to learn about!Work:   I'm not going to do Zone work this week.  I went into hyperdrive last week and did all the curtains and a lot of other things and this week I mean to scale back and be a bit less of a servant to my own demands.There's always work to be done...Agreed?  This week I've made my plans but they aren't quite all they might be.  I expect to do things this week.  Non-work sorts of things.  All work and no play, etc. make a dull girl as well as a dull marriage and a dull writer.  However, I wanted to take time to list routine tasks and jobs that I typically don't mention.  I tend to list other jobs over and above these routine things.In any week I do a 'routine'  twice, on Sunday and on Friday.  This is basic housekeeping especially focused on the 'keeping' part.  A house that is decently kept can tolerate a couple of days with just daily chores being done in between the routine.   A routine  day involves picking up things and putting them away properly, cleaning  the bathrooms and doing minor chores like emptying trash cans, tidying surfaces, any obvious thing that must be cleaned or dusted and of course, sweeping or vacuuming the floors.  This is the day to mop floors if they really need it.  In the kitchen,  I plan meals, gather fragments, etc. while I'm cleaning the fridge.   Then I clean the kitchen.  I   will remove all items on the counters and wipe them down as well as the appliance fronts.   I wipe cabinet doors, sweep and/or mop the floor.   This is the day the trash cans get washed out if they require it.I will take time to sweep the porches and patio on those two days just to try and keep them tidier. I'll clean any smudges on the entry way storm doors. Routine days also see me watering houseplants and the plants on the porches.  On Sunday the routine also includes stripping towels and sheets.  I'll remake the bed and then put out fresh  towels.Daily cleaning:  make the bed, do the dishes, wipe down counters. Put away any clothes we've worn or laundry we've done.  Make meals (that's just a given isn't it?).   I don't work as long nor as hard on the in between days as I do on Sunday and Friday in the house.  I might (might is key here) sweep the kitchen daily but I do not sweep the front entry tile or the bathrooms daily nor do I vacuum daily.    Most weeks, but not this one, I generally will do zone work or yard work on the days I do my daily tasks.   These are also the days I will work on projects indoors or out.  Routine days are full enough without adding any extra work.  Kitchen:  The kitchen this week is going to get a break.  I'm not planning any big baking day or kitchen prep days.  I want to keep meals simple and clearing up just as simple.  I don't do this often but every now and then it's nice to give yourself a break and this week that is my focus.  I find this much easier to do when the weather has warmed and one doesn't want hearty breakfast or dinners to get through the cold days and nights.  We have few leftovers from last week, not even enough to gather a fragment from!   That's highly unusual. We've plenty of easily prepared meal items that can be made in a few minutes time.  Plan a picnic and pack for it.  Plan for afternoon snacks.  I don't want a big something but just a bite or three of something to hold me until supper time which we continue to eat later than we previously have.   One day I made cheese wafers and another day we had a small bowl of chips with a bit of dip.  It's just something big enough to tide us over until we get to the supper hour.   Lunch has usually disappeared by then and supper is still a few hours away.Personal:Read.  Do Sudoku.  Take a walk.  Journal.  Study my Bible and color a page or three in it.  Sit on the porch with a glass of iced tea or water.  What I won't be doing: sticking my face in front of a computer for hours on end mindlessly looking at YouTube or checking Instagram or having a peek at Facebook or Pinning a thousand recipes I'll probably never ever in a hundred years make even one of.   What generally happens following a few days of such treatment is that I get super inspired to do all sorts of things.  So I'll keep a notebook nearby me when I'm being leisurely and make notes.  I'm sure next week I'll be right back to my usual busyness but a break is what I need and a break is what I mean to take."},

I had some birthday money set aside and was hopeful it would cover the cost.  I went online, did the style quiz, gave an honest account of my weight, height and sizes in tops and bottoms and shoes and played a little multiple choice game where I tagged which pictures of outfits appealed to me.Just to compare two sites, I also considered Wantable but they wanted measurements of length of arms and inseam and this and that and it seemed like far too much trouble to me so I quickly closed that page and skipped that long winded process."},

pretty?!We can't see the stove nor the ice box in this room but let's just look at what we can, okay?  I always open the picture in a new tab so that I can see it in a larger format.  Starting all the way over here at the left of the picture...Underneath those three drawers is what appears to be a massive cutting board/dough board that you can pull right out to use.  I love those broad cabinet doors there on that end, too.  So nice for storing a bit stock pot or serving trays and huge old roasters.Next note that the windows are either side of the sink.  Right above the sink are what appears to be three soap holders.  I wonder why they needed three?  Perhaps one is a heavier duty soap, like a pumice type soap for scrubbing hard to remove things and another is just for handwashing and one is for routine dishwashing?   Anybody else know or want to guess?The open space under the sink apparently opens still further.  It appears there is a little step stool to one side.  I wonder if there's a stool there, too, where one might sit while washing dishes or pull over to the dough board.There are double sinks there, too.  How very modern was that to do at that time?As we swing to the right we see a huge wall of storage.   It appears to be set up as a Butler's pantry.  The drawer on the bottom right...Is it a deep drawer?  It looks to be.  But it also almost looks like an oven, doesn't it?   But there are no controls anywhere so I'll stick with cupboard or drawer.The tile is the thing I just love.  So many kitchens had been of wood or brick but tile was seen as a 'cleaner' product to use for the modern 1900's kitchens.   It was believed to be easier to keep sanitary.  Sanitation was a big deal along about this period.  That's why so often the tile extends far up the wall.I think the white with green just looks fresh and lovely.   I would love to see gingham curtains or even plain curtains in yellow with a trim of some sort.  A brand new month will be upon us come Monday morning and I've made my goals for February.  I'll share those in a bit.  I'll keep this simple and to the point this week.   This is what I have planned:Work:  Zone 1:  Kitchen/Back Entry/Laundry   This month I want to focus on cleaning now that everything is freshly organized.  The blinds in the kitchen sitting area are dusty.   There's little bits of dried leaves and crumbles of dirt about the plants.   There are drips and dribbles on cabinet doors and the floors need mopping.  I also want to try to clear the counter tops a bit.  This is an ongoing battle of mine.  What to do with those things I use on a routine basis and yet can't stand looking at?   And how do I make storage room for them when there's none to spare?   I'll try to puzzle this out this week and I hope by week's end my kitchen looks as fresh on the surface as it feels underneath.Big yard project starts this month.  Not something John is likely to have much to do with but it does mean that I need to rethink how I've been dealing with some spaces and what I mean to do about them.   As well I've been given a lot of border material which I'm excited about but now I must figure out how to make it work for me and look consistent.   This is a vast job and will definitely need to be attacked in small bites.Do a complete Freezer inventory and pull forward those things I need to use sooner rather than later.  Also to give me an idea of what I might need if sales appear.There won't be a big grocery shop this week but we will go pick up a few items like lettuce and tomatoes and onions.Go get a haircut.Work up our bills for the month.  I have a few that need to go out this week and I need to total up the checkbook from the past month.  I do keep a running total but I make any adjustments I need to make, note which checks are in and which aren't, etc.  I then have my updated total.  We're usually pretty much where we need to be without any issues.Take donation items from my room over to donation center. Buy birdseed.  My birds are hungry ones and they are going right through my seeds.  I ran into town today to buy a bag but we'll definitely need more.John has a busy weekend coming up and then  a busy week following.  I think if we're going to celebrate our birthday in any way, we might do it later in the month but I'll plan a special meal for us that I make at home.  I really enjoyed working on the genealogy posts and I want to gather information for two posts in February.In the meantime though, I have birthdays to buy for.  I need to go buy gifts for two young ones.  I need to get Amie's gift in the mail to her.  I'm a bit nervous about mailing it but I'm never going to get it to her any other way.Menus:Aside from the first two these are not in order of how they will be served.  I'm not likely to serve chicken on Tuesday after eating it all weekend long.  I simply grouped things by protein in order to think better about what we might have.Items marked with * are or contain Gathered Fragments from my pantry inventory last weekChicken Pot Pie (leftovers), Green Beans, *Peaches in *Orange GelatinGFC (Gramma's Fried Chicken), Potato Salad, Broccoli, *Peach

Agreed?"},
{"title": "The Week Behind:  Who's Tired?", "date": null, "text": "Saturday/Sunday:  It says a lot when we get to the end of a family day and John congratulates me on not losing my cool or being twisted up in knots.   Everything went to plan.  All but the turkey breast cooked on Friday.  I warmed the sausage balls (will NOT be using that recipe again...need to make a note in the cookbook I got it from that it's not the best).   John and I had the kids table out in the kitchen, aka my sewing table, and had moved the pack n play to our bedroom so there was a baby napping zone.  He ran to town to get ice.  I laid out my platters and we had nothing to do for a bit over an hour except to wait on family.   Sunday:  When John told the kids I'd make them pancakes this morning, I had no qualms saying \"Of course.'   I immediately thought of the Whey in the fridge that Bess has given me.  It makes beautiful pancakes, all light and fluffy.  I remembered to add that little bit of baking soda since the Whey is from yogurt and has the same acidity that buttermilk has.John made us Turkey sandwiches tonight.  He also added sausage balls to the plate and deviled eggs and pickles and it was a regular feast of leftovers but by no means did it use up all the leftovers.  He did use up the olives, pickles, deviled eggs and sausage balls.I'll actually check the fridge tomorrow to see what else I might have and then the planning will commence.Waste:  I tossed a partial loaf of homemade bread that I believe to be 2 or 3 weeks old.  I have plenty of croutons and breadcrumbs on hand and just don't need more this week.1 cup of mashed potatoes that were too old to consider using.Monday:  I cleared each shelf in the fridge this morning and here's what I have that needs to be used up:Top shelf:  Whey and Buttermilk.   Second shelf:  I tossed some mashed potatoes and put the stuffing that was leftover last week into the dog's bowl of scraps.I put the chili I made yesterday and the chicken pot pie filling into the freezer for future meals.I have: sliced apples and oranges.  Small piece of cubed steak.1 -1 1/2 cups turkey bitsa dozen slices of Tortilla pinwheelsRanch dip, French onion dip and sour cream: all opened and all will need to be addressed this week or next.a few pieces each of chocolate cake and Apple blondiescooked brown basmati ricecranberry sauce that is openBaked beans1/4 cup of salsasingle serving of chicken pot pieMeat drawer:  4 uncut Tortilla rollups,  Half a Beef KielbasaBottom shelf: cut up celery and carrot sticksVeg crisper drawer:  broccoli heads, green onionsOn the counter: 3 ripe bananas, an acorn squashI come to this week with a plethora of things I should use and some that will possibly carry over to next week for use.Immediate ideas: Stir fry rice with the rice, some of the carrot and celery sticks, and green onion.   I have chicken tenders in the freezer, so that would be a quick meal for lunch or dinner.   Orange slices will be nice as a side dish.Unroll the four tortilla rollups and put chopped turkey on them, then roll them up and heat them in the oven with salsa.   I'd serve with a salad and black beans.Some things can be translated into a quick lunch: chicken pot pie and the already cut tortilla roll ups.The cake and blondies will be easy desserts to have this week.The cubed steak will be served alongside eggs and biscuits for breakfast.   The biscuits will use up some of the whey and buttermilk.  I'll make up an extra lot of biscuits and put those in the freezer for easy use.  I'll also be making Shabat bread this week and that will use another cup of the whey.  I suppose I could mix up one batch of dough and use to make rolls and freeze them.  Do I have that much freezer space?Make applesauce with the apples.  I can use as a simple dessert or put in the freezer to save for another day.I have an idea to use the French onion dip in a chicken pasta dish. Trouble is I have no chicken at present, but if I happen to have leftovers of chicken from Thanksgiving, I could use it in that dish.Happy accident!  My stainless steel loaf pans just arrived and in the insert is a recipe for a Banana Pineapple Nut bread.  I was just thinking I was over the banana nut loaf and the chocolate chip banana muffins, so this might be worth trying as a new to me recipe.  That will use up two bananas.I can use some one banana, 1/2 an apple and a couple of orange slices to make a quick fruit salad.  That might be nice with the Stuffed Acorn Squash I thought I'd make one night this week.  I have sausage and rice stuffing in the freezer already.Planning of course, is only have the battle.   John and I ate the tortilla rollups (and then tossed the remainder of the cut ones as they were soggy...I think I put 3-4 slices in the trash) and he ate the chicken pot pie and cranberry sauce.I made Fried Rice this evening using some of the celery, green onion, the thicker stems from the bottom of the broccoli, and the last of the baby carrots (apparently a far more popular item than I'd thought they might be, as there were only 3 left).I also had several packets of sauces in the fridge and used one of those to sauce our chicken tenders to go with our fried rice at supper.  We ate the oranges as our side for that meal.  Tuesday:   Without execution a plan is NOTHING, right?   I've been busy in my kitchen and here's what I've done with some of the above leftovers.  As things have been completely used up, I'm putting a line through them, so you can see my full progress.This morning, I used one banana to make Banana Oatmeal.  I cooked the banana gently in butter, then added brown sugar and egg and milk to the oats.  This is quite good and very filling.I used two bananas to make a Pineapple Banana bread.  I am out of cinnamon and walnuts and didn't want to use pecans in the bread, so it's not a nut bread.   The recipe called for 8 ounces of pineapple.  I had 5 ounces too much for the Cranberry Celebration Salad I was making for Bess so I used the 1/2 cup that was over measure for that recipe.   This is a cobbled together recipe as you can see... When these were baked and cooled, I wrapped and put them in the freezer for future snacking.I used the whey to make biscuits and pieced out the remaining whey with buttermilk for the cornbread for our Thanksgiving dressing breads.  That took care of all the Whey.I doubled the biscuit recipe so we will have biscuits in the morning for our breakfast.I warmed the baked beans and fed them to John with hot dogs for our lunch today.And finally for supper,  I unrolled the four remaining Tortilla rollups and topped with the turkey that was leftover from our sandwiches on Sunday.  I mixed the last of the salsa with a can of cream of chicken soup and layered the tortillas and sauce in a casserole dish, since the chunks of turkey were too big to allow me to roll them up again. I topped all of this with some Colby Jack cubes I'd found (! just when you think you've gathered all the fragments!) that I grated and when it all came from the oven, I put chopped green onions over each serving.   There's enough of this left to have for lunch one day this week.And so ends another productive day in my kitchen.  And my list is greatly reduced by now!Wednesday:  Used the piece of cubed steak this morning. I reheated it as biscuits baked and served it alongside fried eggs.   John was pretty happy with his breakfast.  He's big on eggs with steak...Me, not so much.   Anyone else think eggs and beef steak are made for one another?For tonight's dinner:  I'm making Potatoes au Gratin with the Kielbasa on top of the dish.  Then I'll steam some of the broccoli as a side dish.I'll leave off here with my Gathering because we all know that the landscape of what we have will change dramatically following our holiday meals.  I'll start fresh on Friday with leftovers and things I know I must use up."},

I only know how much the processing costs, not how much meat I'll get but in about two weeks we'll have a bunch of meat coming in.  This fact has started me on a bevy of mental lists.I need to defrost and then sort the freezer.  As always I've crammed in the odd item that I meant to save.  This is the place where I determine if I'm actually going to save it and make something of it, or dump it and let that be a reminder to me to stop pushing in a dab of this and a bit of that.  I'm going to plan for 50 pounds of meat....We'll see if that is sufficient enough planning.   Sam had said two weeks ago that he believes we'll need one more to get through the year and so his fourth deer will also be for us.  Since we typically eat a half pound of ground meat twice a week...I'm thinking we won't need a second deer but then  I can have it cut into cubed steaks, roasts and more sausage, so I can get good use from a second deer I think."},

{"title": "The Week Behind:  Maybe Not?", "date": null, "text": "Saturday:  I was so restless last night that I slipped off to the guest room to toss and turn.  I couldn't breathe through my stuffy nose nor get comfortable.  I do find the firmer mattress has it's merits when my back aches and I did eventually go off to sleep.I took my leisurely cup of Blueberry coffee in the sunny kitchen sitting area.  It was lovely to read my Bible and take my time.    While I was sitting there John asked if I'd like to grocery shop today but I declined.  We will be in the same area tomorrow for church, we have nothing to do all morning long after that.  I do enjoy my quiet Sabbath day at home and I rarely agree to do anything that will disturb it.Bess walked over about 10ish and had a cup of the blueberry coffee and we chatted a little bit before she headed home.  I played about with genealogy, a game I've been enjoying on my phone, reading blogs and not much else.  Meals have been easy.  Now that we're drawing near the end of the day, the dishes have been cleared up and a full load run through the dishwasher.  It has been a lovely day, quiet and peaceful and easygoing.  Sunday:  I forgot to set my alarm last night.  Thank goodness, John remembered to set his!  We were up and off to church at our usual time.  We're always a bit late it seems but we do our very best to arrive on time to that earliest church service.Plans today for after church was grocery shopping.  I went to Aldi and to Publix.  I spent my full budget.  John asked if this was 'normal' and I told him I'm afraid we're going to find this is altogether normal.  At Aldi we picked up nothing extra that wasn't slated for the grocery budget, or that was unusual for our pantry and freezer.  At Publix, we spent about $12 on our lunch items and generally avoided even looking at anything that wasn't on my list to buy.  I don't know how we'll fare this month, but I've milk to make yogurt with, as well as to drink, plenty of half and half and some longer last fruits, such as apples and oranges.  I told John I'm just not going to sweat over the budget.  I know I have that bit extra on hand that I'd intended to spend anyway and we'll use it and we just aren't going to worry otherwise...He seemed to feel we'd need to add in foods we typically don't eat to lower costs but I assured him at this point in time we needn't worry over that.Put away groceries after we got in.  This took about an hour.  I told John it's so easy to pile in the buggy but it makes real work when you're hauling it in from the car and taking bags to the pantry and having to find space to put it all.  He agreed, as well he might, since he's the main one hauling things about for me.I put together a decent enough supper for us of fresh celery sticks, deli purchase (at Aldi) macaroni salad, and some Buffalo chicken tenders.  I bought a lot of convenience items on Friday evening and for the Chinese bowls and the dumplings, and a frozen pizza from a brand we like.  I probably won't do that sort of thing again because I know I can make better myself.  But I will consider buying these Buffalo chicken tenders again, simply because for an item ready in twenty minutes it was rather decent.  As for the macaroni salad, I've tried and tried to make it.  John simply doesn't care for my homemade macaroni salad except the tuna pasta one that I make.  It's the dressing that he likes on the deli salad.It was a long day overall.  Up early, all that grocery shopping and putting things away, doing a big load of laundry, remaking the bed with fresh linens, unloading the dishes I washed Saturday evening and sorting out the house overall.  I was rather happy to settle into my chair after supper and simply relax.Monday:  I woke with an aching ear and a head packed full of cotton.  My ear malady has returned I'm sorry to say.  I am using basil oil and taking my decongestants and Tylenol.  This is the usual ear problems I have, twice a year, late winter and late summer.  Ho hum.  It doesn't make me feel very happy but the doctor assures me there's nothing there but just fluid and I can hum and do what I'm doing or whine and do what I'm doing...Sigh.I had planned to do a whole house task of floors today.   Well I didn't quite make it.  I just don't feel well and it was the best I could manage to vacuum the main living area, tiny hallway and our bedroom deeply.  I still need to do the guest room and I'll need to sweep and mop the hard floors, but not today I won't!   It took me about 3 hours work to get the vacuuming done, what with moving furniture about and all.I also watered front porch plants and the end of the patio ones, including that corner plot.  I cut flowers.  I cleaned house before I did the vacuuming and I set out foods to be dealt with today.  I have a chicken recipe cooking for our supper.  I have browned a pound of ground meat with onions and garlic.  Half went into the fridge for a meal this week and half into the freezer for another day.  I have rice cooked for two meals, and a half dozen boiled eggs on back of stove.  I baked a special peach pie recipe that I've never had before.  I've messed up a double sink full of dishes.  I've also cut up and portioned and put away the meats I bought yesterday, which included a corned beef brisket, a top round steak, and  a packet of Picada Asada meat.  I have folded and put away clothes.  John skipped breakfast, I found items to put out for lunch, and I have a plan for supper which is mostly prepared.  I am tired.  I will need to go into town this evening to pick up Caleb from nursery since Katie and Chad's work hours prevent their being there on time.  It is my plan to have supper all ready for our return, though we will need to reheat some portion of it.I didn't feel up to gathering fragments today, not much anyway.  And that's okay.  Sometimes things just don't go our way and we're forced to step back a little more than we might want to.  I think I'm going to gift myself a nap now.I changed up a recipe that calls for beef chuck roast (Mongolian Beef) and used chicken thighs instead.  It turned out really good!  I'm glad I made this substitute because thighs are certainly a much lower priced meat than chuck roast and it makes the recipe that much more versatile in my opinion.  I served the chicken with wild rice and steamed Broccoli.  It was as much stem as it was florets but I'm tired of wasting the stems and if cooked until tender it's quite edible.Tuesday:  I am not feeling well but I know I won't feel any worse if I work, lol.  So I went outdoors this morning and got all the sticks up from under the Pecan tree, most of them up from the Sweetgum tree bed and weeded about another 1/2 of the area that needed weeding.  That seemed like plenty of work to me for outdoor work.After I came back indoors, I sat down to cool off and looked up how to clear a blocked Eustachian tube which is the problem I'm having at present, result of that slight head cold last week.  I found a whole YouTube by a chiropractor of exercises and massages one might do to help unblock the Eustachian tube.  I immediately put these things into practice and repeated them periodically all through the day.  It can't hurt...I made tuna fish salad for our lunch, using a diced apple to both stretch the tuna and cut down on the acidity of it.  I use about 1/2 to 3/4 cup of finely diced apple, 1 big heaping tablespoon of sweet pickle relish, about 2 tbsps, of mayonnaise (NOT heaping) and 1 finely diced hard boil egg, to 1 can of drained tuna.  This generally makes enough for three biggish or four regular sized sandwiches, depending on the size of your bread slices.I spoke with Becca this morning and told her I'd take a produce bag this week.  I didn't know that Bess was going to visit, but Becca texted me that she was sending the bag with Bess to save me a trip over (it's about an hour round trip).  I really appreciated that.My bag contained tomatoes, pears, a bell pepper, spinach, basil, green beans, okra, cucumbers.  I snapped the beans right away and then put them in boiling water to blanch.  I removed only half of them, added diced potatoes to the remaining beans to cook for our supper.  I  put the blanched beans immediately in an iced water bath and then dried them off to flash freeze for the freezer.  I diced the okra right away and dusted heavily with cornmeal and froze in a container.  I'll fry this in the future.  This is the way I grew up eating Okra, not battered as I've done the last two times, but simply salt and peppered and dusted with cornmeal then sauteed in a little oil until crispy.Our supper tonight was Pan Seared Cubed Steak, fresh green beans with baby potatoes, and fresh sliced tomato.  John tickled me when I sat our plates on the table.  \"Boy!  What are the poor folks eating tonight?\"  I laughed and said \"This is purely country cooking.  It's how I grew up eating.\"  And it was, too.  We didn't eat 'gourmet', which is what Katie told my cousin was how I cooked, lol.  No in my childhood, it was simple foods cooked as well as we could and using the freshest possible ingredients, especially in summer when the gardens were producing.  Off to go pick up Caleb this afternoon and he felt much better.  He tickled John because he insisted on standing up and then jumping up and down to indicate that he wanted to get into his jumper seat, lol.  He spent a good fifteen minutes working off that energy and then was ready to have his supper.  It was good to see him feeling more lively.I know I did more on this day but I cannot remember what else I did.Wednesday:  I had a brief moment last night when I felt the pressure release in my ear...That to me is a most hopeful sign.  It came a lot sooner than it did last time I dealt with this.  I continue with the basil oil and massage and exercises.  I discontinued the decongestant.  Knowing how my body works, I'm following my intuition.  There is a point where decongestant is helpful and while my doctor recommended I do several dosages daily, I felt strongly that this was making the remaining mucous thicker rather than thinner.  Not taking decongestant in 12 hours, I found I have had two more incidences of moments without the constant tinnitus and pressure.  I'll take moments of freedom because I know it's a sign of this mess breaking up.Peach streusel muffins for breakfast started our day, with hardboiled eggs.  That was just the beginning of the kitchen morning.  I set sourdough English muffins up last night, using the Bigger Bolder Baking recipe once more, as I wanted to see if I could catch the 'feel' of this dough.  The muffins turned out okay.  I made mine a little smaller and not quite thick enough but they are prettier than the last ones I tried.I also made bagels today, getting more than a dozen from that recipe (Nikki Vegan Bagels on YouTube).  I cut the Acorn squash and deseeded the halves then put them in the oven with the bagels since it was on anyway.I made Yogurt.  Honestly there are days when it seems like the gas on my stove runs slow...It took forever for that milk to heat to 185f today.  Other days it seems like it heats up far too quickly. I'm convinced I had evaporated milk by the time I got it to the right temperature.  I had sterilized my jars earlier and used that same hot water to boil the bagels.  I dumped it out and washed the pot, heated more water for incubating the yogurt.   When this is done tonight, I will put that water over outdoor plants once fully cooled.Then I started making lunches for John and I.  He had spent the morning mowing while I worked in the kitchen.   My lunch was eaten while timing bagels in the oven.  While he was eating lunch, I was doing my dinner prep for tonight.  I've changed my menu from taco bowls to either nachos or tacos.  I didn't realize I had so many riced based dishes on the menu this week and I decided to eliminate one of them. And in between breads rising and milk heating and all of that, I got our bills done for the month and have those things ready to go into the mail this evening when we go into town.  I worked hard.  This is one of those days that sounds like so little when written out but which in actually took quite a long while!I washed a full load of dishes in the dishwasher and several sinks full as the morning went on.  I unloaded the dishwasher this evening while heating up the taco meat and shells.Thursday:  John is catching on.  He planned out this morning's breakfast menu last night and added, \"And I'll use up what was left from our taco toppings in the omelet.\"  Well good on him!  It was a delicious omelet and I appreciated the break from making breakfast.We ran errands this morning.  It didn't take so long to do since we remained within the county, but it was a pleasant enough outing.   The main highway between the two towns is being repaved.  We noted that if we returned by the same route we'd have to wait in a long hot line of cars to get past the area being paved today.  I pointed out a roadway that would take us along a country road back to our town where we were running our last errand.It was a nostalgic drive for me, taking an old county road named for part of our family and past my great great aunt's former home place as well as my great grandmother's old house.  There was plenty of new houses along the old country roads but here and there we'd pass a house I could recall passing as a child on trips with Granny out to visit Big Mama.  It's a strange thing to have the mind telescope back through time and see the roadways as they were fifty odd years ago as well as seeing them as they are today.  I can recall many a summer morning spent driving out to Big Mama's to spend the day with her.John stopped to pick up a laundry list of parts for necessary repairs and maintenance on things.  I sat in the car and watched videos while he did that.Home again, I put out a simple lunch of leftovers: cubed steak, macaroni salad, avocado and lettuce from last night.  It made a decent enough lunch.  I think tonight I'll opt for the Twice Baked potato menu since we've had meat for breakfast and for lunch.  At this point it was past 2pm...and I figured anything I might accomplish was never going to be completed by the time I needed to leave home to pick up Caleb from nursery.   I opted instead to make our supper ahead so that I could heat and eat when we walked back in.  I  read over my to do list for this week and noted that I had touched on several items on my list but nothing is completed...Well then it will just go on next week's list unless I get it all done tomorrow and that's not very likely.Supper:  Twice Baked Potatoes, Lima Beans, Green Salad.   Worked on genealogy this evening and had some lovely stumbles that gave me more information than I'd had on relatives who'd previously been elusive.  Friday:  Can I just laugh over my plans for the week?  I woke with my ear feeling better but still not normal and an aching back from sleeping on two pillows to prop myself up for better drainage.  It took me a little while to get going this morning.  After I'd made my way slowly through a cup of coffee, I made us a breakfast of  English Muffins with egg and cheese.  We call them McCheney's in our house. Bess texted asking if they might come over today.  We'd planned to get together yesterday afternoon but none of our plans jelled.    I thought about my list and thought about Josh starting school on Monday and decided I'd heaps rather have a family day than a 'knock it off the list' day.  So I hurried through clearing away things and making the bed and told Bess to come on over.It was a lovely morning.  Today the boys had time with Grampa in the living room while Bess and I had time in the kitchen acting like adult women instead of Mamas.  I held Millie after Grampa had a nice long session with her and just enjoyed my time with the girls.   Of course, Isaac and Josh both came in to get a little attention from me, but mostly they played with Grampa and that was fine for this visit.I baked a loaf of bread for Shabat and used the whey from Bess in the loaf and about 11:30 I mixed up pizza dough using more of the whey.  I find that warming it to just room temperature it's working just fine in the baked items.  Everything I've used it in thus far has been a yeast bread and it's not minding one bit the use of whey over water.I let the boys make their own pizzas...I'm glad they chose small 4 inch pie tins to make pizza in because they both refused to eat it after it was baked.   Silly boys.  We adults enjoyed ours but there's plenty of pizza left over for John and I to make a lunch or two over the weekend.The boys picked up the play area, Bess picked up the living room and I cleared up the kitchen.   They had planned to walk home but it began to thunder so I told her I'd run them home.   We made it out the door just as the rain began to come down.As we jumped in the car, so did River and Rufus...I've been letting Rufus ride with me up to Bess' because he is an old dog and will run all the way up the road behind my car and then run all the way back too when I start home and never stop to rest himself.  We figured both dogs would just get out at her house and go indoors with them, but no, they did not.  Nor did they willingly leave the car when I got home.  It took quite a bit of fuss and persuasion and lifting to get them out of the car after I got back here.I started a load of dishes and use the carpet sweeper on the dining area rug and the house was pretty much Shabat ready, despite having company all morning.  Katie texted that we won't need to pick up Caleb this afternoon, which I pretty much expected since Chad works outdoors and storms generally put an end to his work day.Supper plans: Stuffed Acorn Squash, Sauteed Spinach   It sounds like a light meal but there's rice in with the meat I'll stuff the squash with.   I expect there will be leftovers of the squash for another meal.  There were two squash and though they are small, I think it will be too much for us.It wasn't the week I planned over last weekend, but it's been a week full of living and who would want anything different?How did your week go? I will keep doing this series of posts for a little while longer.  I generally account for these sorts of things within my weekly post where I share frugal kitchen, homemaking and general commentary points of each day.  However, I think it might help me/you/someone else to see these tips all in one place rather than scattered through a daily dairy type post.  That's why I started doing this in the first place.  Last month I paid close attention to my reading of  previous years' August posts and I noted that scattering them throughout made it a little harder to dig out the nuggets of information.   After watching Amy Maryon do her weekly 'Gathering Fragments', I felt that was one of the most helpful posts she did weekly for me personally.  Hence, here we are.But I'd like to know your opinions on the matter.  Is this type of post, where I separate out how I used food fragments and lingering pantry items helpful to you?  Does it make you stop and think about your own food stores and the items that you haven't used?  Have you been inspired?  I would love it if you shared some of your ideas for using up items.All that said, I have been Gathering Fragments in my home this week.  Here's what I've done.Saturday:  Noted that John left a peanut butter jar on the counter.  This is a sign that he's done with the jar, but he knows I will clean it out properly.   I guess I've taught him something because not just the peanut butter jar...He found a peach with a bruised spot on it and set it in the fridge so I could, in his words,  'use it up'.  I do appreciate that the man has noticed how I do my best to make good use of all our foodstuffs.Bess, too.  She walked over this morning with a big two quart jar about half full of whey left from straining her yogurt.  She mentioned that it freezes well, too.   I'll be happy to try and make good use of this item!Monday:  Yesterday we went grocery shopping.  I was putting things in the produce drawer and noted that it seemed damp.  Doggone it!  My celery from last month had spoiled and it was well wrapped in foil and everything.  No salvage of that except to use as compost.Well that made me think of an article I'd read a long while back about what you could compost.  It listed such items as paper towels and paper towel tubes, thin cardboard that had been shredded, etc.   What you shouldn't compost: citrus fruits or onions (they kill worms and take a long time to break down), glossy paper, ashes from a wood fire but not from a charcoal grill nor coal or any type of treated fire logs used in a fireplace.  I didn't get as much done in my kitchen today as I wanted but I did manage to (a) start dinner (b) scrape out that peanut butter jar, which netted me enough to spread on my morning toast and (c) make a really lovely pie using the two peaches that John put in the fridge.  The bruises on both were really superficial, so I was able to use almost all of them.  I also pulled out all the older green onions and chopped them.  I put the root ends into my little bowl on the kitchen window shelf to start.  I'll plant them in my planter as soon as they show some type of growth.Yesterday morning I was trying to slice Friday's bread for toast.  It crumbled at the touch of the knife.  I took the remaining loaf this morning and completely crumbled it then put these crumbs in the freezer.  I'll use these as my fresh bread crumbs.  It freed up space in my refrigerator freezer and compacted down to a smaller space in my chest freezer.Tuesday:  Went through the fridge and noted I need to use spinach leaves right away.  I also found the ginger root that Bess bought me a few weeks back, which I'd more or less forgotten.  I sliced it and put that into the freezer.I didn't have any foods to 'gather' or use right away but I am now fully aware of what is in the fridge which means less chance to waste food.  I did have a bit of food waste.  I think it's because it's not something I typically have on hand, I waited too long to try to use, 2 small Asian pears.  I waited until they were slightly soft, which meant the inside was mushy.  I think it's one of those fruits I should have used while still firm and crisp.Bess went to visit the girl who sells me the produce bags.  She sent my bag with Bess to save me the trip over to pick it up.  I snapped and blanched green beans, put half in the freezer and cooked the rest for our supper tonight.  I also went ahead and sliced the okra, dusted heavily with cornmeal and put that in a container in the freezer.  Those are my 'every little bit counts' items.Wednesday:  The bananas we purchased Sunday were at peak ripeness.  I pulled off two for John and I to eat today and immediately put the rest in the freezer in a container marked with how many is in the container.The avocado Katie gave me was at peak ripeness too.  I diced it, salted it and sprinkled lime juice on it.  I'll have this with my taco meat for supper tonight.  I saved the pit to try and root.  I've had small Avocado trees in the past but never stay on top of them.  They will grow in my area if I move them indoors at night (I mean to lobby hard for a small green house next year...).As I diced tomato, I noted that some of the seeds and juice were on the counter.  I used a paper towel to wipe this up and will let it dry, then save those little seeds to replant.Thursday:  John made omelets this morning.  He used the last of the shredded pepper jack cheese, diced tomato and diced green onions in the omelet.  It was really good!I peeled and sliced three peaches to put into the freezer.waste:  I had an orange with a bad spot on it.  After reading that this is no good for compost, I decided to toss it into the trash.Our lunch today was an accumulation of things from the fridge: avocado tossed in lime juice, shredded lettuce, leftover macaroni salad and two pieces of cubed steak from supper the other night.  We've done such a good job this week of keeping up with things in the fridge but I did note last night when I went to put away the remaining taco shells that I already had an open box with a remainder in it...I guess I'd better move out of the fridge and start looking harder at the cabinets and pantry to see what I might need to use that has been lingering on the shelves.Friday:  No time to check cupboards today...Bess and Millie and the boys were here visiting this morning and stayed to have lunch.  It was a lovely long visit.   I figured I had two plans for lunch: hot dogs or pizza.  I opted for pizza because it's a great way to use up things in the fridge.  I finished off a jar of black olives, used up spinach and basil from the produce bag, as well as a green bell pepper, some cut onion."},
{"title": "Iced Tea Chat: Lovely August Things", "date": null, "text": "Hello, dears!  There are lovely things about August.  I know it's terribly hot but that's proper August weather and I'd rather have it hot than unseasonal.  So what are the lovely things about August: the aroma of freshly mown grass, the loud serenade of cicadas in the trees, flowers blooming, fresh garden produce, the sound of canning jars pinging shut, the aroma of a charcoal grill, the sound of children screeching as they dash through a sprinkler or splash in a pool in the yard, the steady hum of mowers all over the neighborhood, the flavor of a fresh ripe tomato and the regret as we bite into the last fully ripened peach of the season...Oh there are so many things to savor about August!Where are my manners?  Would you like tea or an icy glass of our good well water?  I'm leaning hard on water these days.  I feel it is the most beneficial but I shall have tea.  I can overdo the water a bit and start to feel a little depleted.   I told John this is the worst of times to be out of electrolyte drinks and requested he pick some up when he went to town to get gas for the mower the other day.  I further added to the supply and bought a big tub of powder when we went into the grocery this past weekend.Where shall I start?   Josh was to back to school last week but it's been postponed until next week.  Taylor will start kindergarten at the same time.   We shall see how that goes. Isaac says he's going to go to school this year, too, \"Grampa school.\" lol    It hardly seems right to not have school start at this time of year, but I do understand the cautions. There's been careful instructions issued about wearing masks, and sanitizing hands at home for Josh and a weekly list of rules from the school in the local newspaper.  The county has done a great deal to insure the students will be safe with checkpoints at the doors and fewer students to a classroom and students staying in classroom all day long and not swapping classes as they had in the lower grades, nor leaving the class room to eat and no public use of fountains.  I do hope they get some sort of recreation time outdoors.   It's hard on 6 year old children to be shut in a room all day long.   The new year mentality does take hold when the calendar turns to August...I get into that mode myself.  I stocked up on notebooks and paper last week.  I love a neat stack of paper waiting to be filled with plans and dreams and prayers and lists.  I feel just as excited as I did when I was school age.  The long lonely summers were over and the whirl of school and being around friends five days a week meant much to this country girl.   My parents didn't believe in having friends over to visit or allowing us to go visit anyone other than Granny and on rarer occasions to Grandmother's. While I loved living in the country, I did envy the classmates that lived in town and made visits to one another's homes.  So yes, the school year meant a great deal to us children as it does to Josh.  He too is a country boy and while Sam and Bess do have friends with children his age, they are all busy and visits are few and far between. Sunday as we drove to church I admired the lush green fields.  Cotton, soy beans, peanuts are mostly what we see this year and the cotton is blooming.  I spied a crow sitting atop an electric pole surveying a wide open field and wondered if he was admiring the view as I had been.   This summer has been a rare one with just enough rain to water the crops and not so much that they are too saturated to grow well.   It's kept the lawns green and lush, too.  I've seen pear trees heavy with fruit and it appears that peach season was a good one.It's also meant John is mowing grass a lot this summer.   He mowed on Sunday afternoon and I had some rare quiet time alone which was much appreciated.  It was lovely to sit here and have no television talking.   That is the one thing that I think is hardest about retirement is that the television is almost constantly on.  It makes my head feel overfull at times to have it on so much.   I love these rare moments when it is shut off.I sat here and just relished it.  I listened to a little soothing music but I shut that off as well and just enjoyed the quietness about me.  I'd worked hard that morning and afternoon and was more than ready to sit and enjoy the peacefulness.  I think it's partly why I slept so very well that night.I'll not complain too much about the television.  John has picked up several older programs that we're watching nightly, like \"Have Gun Will Travel\", \"The Dick Van Dyke Show\", \"Dragnet\", and occasionally \"Bewitched\".  It's lighter fare than news commentaries and I enjoy these older programs.  It makes for a more relaxed evening overall.The week has meandered by.  It seems it's all gone quickly, with tomorrow being Friday, but at the same time, as I look back if feels more leisurely.  This week especially feels leisurely.  I had such a long list of things I meant to accomplish but I've only touched on this thing and that and nothing has really been completed except grocery shopping and bills.  Never mind.  I've tried.I tackled the blinds last week and got them dusted.  I weeded about the house and nearly finished in a single 30 minute session.  I did get out in the yard to start on that task, but I've done nothing about the porches.  I had to wash and hang out a quilt end of last week when baby boy surprised me with a shower while I was changing his diaper, but no curtains washed and hung to dry though the week has been prime for it.  As I said, I touched on a few jobs, I got little bits done.   My reason for not getting more done is simply that I haven't been well.  My slight head cold has turned into my annual allergy/Eustachian tube blockage and I've been dealing with the side effects of that.  I'm getting better though, having decided that I'd rather listen to my own intuition as to what to do and am having a little success.  It's breaking up far sooner than it did last winter! I have been so determined to 'put by' something this year and with more cucumbers and tomatoes than we could easily eat this week, I put up a single pint jar of salsa and another of pickle relish.   I have to say that I was nervous about this bit of water bath canning and it wasn't without trials.  I searched hard to find basic recipes so I had most of the ingredients on hand.  I could find celery seed in the stores easily enough but not one mustard seed was to be had.  I had to order those from Amazon.  I like freshly ground mustard seed in my homemade blue cheese dressing and as I stood at the stove yesterday I realized that the mustard and celery seed could be used on corned beef along with bay leaf and red pepper.  I cooked a corned beef this past week and there was no pickle seasoning packet with it but really I now have all on hand that I'll need in future.Anyway, I didn't follow the recipes exactly.  I followed them pretty nearly...I worried about that at first, but then remembered the vast number of recipes I'd read through over the past few days as I sought the 'right' one and how each differed in ingredients or processing time, etc. and decided that as long as I had the basics right I'd likely come out okay.  And I did.  Both jars sealed immediately.  I had a wee bit of pickle relish extra and put that in the fridge.  It tastes GOOD!  We didn't have any extra of the salsa, and since I have a jar of store bought in the fridge, we won't be opening it right away, but I don't mind sharing that I was right proud of those two little pint jars on my counter yesterday.I have snapped and blanched and frozen green beans, sliced okra and battered some and flash frozen them, and then sliced another batch and dusted those with cornmeal to freezer.  That's the way we did it when I was growing up.  I've put away a few peaches in the freezer.  It's all just bits and pieces but that's okay.  It's a little more than I had before.Jars...when I went into the cabinet to seek out jars for canning, I found I had two pint jars and 1 quart jar.  That's it.  I can account for one 1/2 pint jar and one pint jar that are in the freezer, and one quart jar and one pint jar in the fridge, but that does not explain where the rest are.  I should have dozens!  Nope.  None to be had.   Where do they disappear to?  In the past I'd used quart jars to store some of my dry goods but over time I've replaced those with canisters or half gallon and gallon jars.  Where did the pint and quart jars go?  I haven't broken them.  I might have passed a few on to the kids with soup in them but they are generally pretty good about returning my jars, usually with something in them...Well needless to say I am going to be looking for jars and lids and buying them as I see them.  It's one reason I miss estate sales.  There were always plenty of canning jars at estate sales in this area.  In the past a woman wasn't worth her salt who didn't put something up each summer, even if she didn't garden and most of them were gardeners, too...Nowadays, Ball and Mason jars are more likely to be used as drinking glasses and flower vases, especially for country weddings and parties.Anyway, if I see any jars, I am going to start gathering them, even if it's one or two at a time at a thrift store.  John was watching one of his lawnmowing videos the other day and the man's wife was hunting all over for canning jars.  She'd mentioned in an earlier video that her green beans had gone crazy and I'm pretty sure she meant to can them.  They ended up buying some from friends who had boxes of them in the shed.  John asked, \"What?  Is there a shortage on glass jars, too?\"  \"Yep, there is!\" I told him,  \"and what's more you're very lucky to find someone willing to pass them on to you, too!\"At one time, Taylor County, and probably other rural counties, too, had a Rural Homemaker's Club.  Can you imagine how nice that must have been?  They met once a month and shared recipes, quilted, had extension service programs, etc.  Doesn't all that just sound lovely?  I'd have enjoyed a group like that to belong to but I admit that by the time I became a full time homemaker, I was the odd one out.  Other women worked part time at the very least, and most were pursuing a career.  Those few who stayed at home full time cared little for the joys of homemaking.   They were more prone to have maids and spend their days shopping, or going golfing.    Yes, I was the odd one out, but it didn't dull my enjoyment of my days puttering about my house and yard and it still doesn't.  And really I guess I do have a sort of homemaker's club albeit an online one amongst so many other like minded women!We went off to do our monthly lot of errands this morning and took a detour home.  It took me back to my childhood days.  We so enjoyed being at Granny's but even better was to be at Granny's and have her take us out to Big Mama's to visit.   That was the route we took back from the other town today and I was just filled with nostalgia remembering those sunny summer mornings driving out.  I just remembered it's also one of the roads Granny taught us to drive on because it had so little traffic.   Yes, it was Granny who taught us to drive.  By the time we had our learning permits we had a working knowledge of how to operate a car and keep it on our side of the roadway.  She was very patient with us about it.   I don't know if our parents were ever aware that she'd done so...Surely they must have wondered at our relative ease in getting behind the wheel of a car and taking off?  But there were plenty of things none of us ever mentioned to our parents.  There was a sort of unwritten rule that what happened at Granny's stayed at Granny's and was between us and her and seldom were parents informed of anything happening unless there was bodily injury that required a doctor involved and that only happened once.  We were rather free spirited creatures when we were here and after working in the morning, we headed out to the backs of the fields into the wooded hillsides to play or down to the creek to dam it up, and one rainy summer, we spent a whole week sliding down muddy ditch banks and hauling one another out of mud that sucked and grabbed at us as we sank up to our thighs in ditches.   Granny just hosed us off  outdoors and we were sent indoors to strip off and shower in twos.   I've no idea how she got our clothes clean or dry, but they were!We ate well at Granny's, too.  We had a proper breakfast most mornings, seldom did she go to the expense of trying to feed us cereal.  We usually had a sandwich lunch with fruit and cookies to follow.  Suppers were proper meals as well, with meat and vegetables and a pudding or ice cream as dessert or in leaner times, chilled peaches or water melon.  We drank lots of water but had tea and Koolaid, too, though seldom sodas.  Granny used all her best stretching recipes to feed us but we never left the table hungry and we were seldom hungry between meals.   We did work while we were here.  We pruned and weeded and cleaned house and stretched barbwire and picked berries or helped pare apples and pears.  We snapped and shelled beans and peas.  We helped cook and mowed grass.   But Granny left us plenty of time to just play and be kids, too.  Sometimes she'd set up the old canvas army tent and we'd spend the night outdoors.   There was no need of worrying over us.  I mean there were seven of us, and it wasn't likely something would happen to any one of us without six piling on to protect the one!I make it sound as though we had all summer long with her but we didn't.  Often it was a week or two or at most three all summer long but it was a haven for all of us.  Life was hard at home for each set of us children.  It wasn't until my cousin and I reunited as older 50 somethings that we told our stories of abuse and alcoholism.  Did Granny know this?  I doubt we ever told her, no more than we'd let our secrets be known to one another,  though likely one cousin did drop a hint the day Granny was forced to switch her sister for a serious transgression of rules and the cousin said \"Just use the broomstick on her Granny, it's what they do at home!\"    I suspect Granny did know some of what went on in our homes.  She was observant.  I knew that from the gentle talks she'd sometimes give us about morals and respect and faith which always seemed to be very on point to a situation in our lives even though we mightn't have breathed a word.Oh my...I've meandered along back roads of memories as easily as we wound our way back to town this morning on those old roads!Well let us take a different road of memory.  There was one summer week that we were at home with Mama and Daddy.  I don't remember why they were home, but it must have been one of those summers when they had time off and we had no plans to travel.  Daddy's Aunt and Uncle came in unexpectedly one afternoon.   We were in one of those busy spells at home, with garden produce coming out of our ears and canning and freezing ongoing and all the process of putting things away.  Aunt Martha and Uncle Hoyt were childless, but they'd babysat most all of their nieces and nephews at some point and a great many of their great nieces and nephews, too.  Aunt Martha was an attractive enough woman, but she was rather somber faced and a little bit daunting until you realized she was stern outside and marshmallow fluff inside.   We three kids had spent long weekends with her many times in the past when Mama's daddy was in the hospital in Aunt Martha's hometown so we were well familiar with her and Uncle Hoyt.   It was unusual for them to come visit on their own.  They generally might have ridden down with Granddaddy and Grandmother and stayed a few hours but this time they came and we soon found that Aunt Martha was on a mission.  \"Now Ann, I need new dresses and I know you can sew, so I thought we'd just come down and you could run me up two or three...Now don't you fret none, we'll be saying overnight...\"    To say that Mama wasn't quite prepared to do dressmaking in the midst of her summer canning week would be putting it mildly.   Yes, and to have company, too, which meant the traditional Southern hospitality spread of more than the usual amount of food which was considered only polite when one had company.   Company could generally be construed as those who didn't come often enough to be considered merely family so Aunt Martha definitely qualified for company in this instance.  I took over the canning and cooking duties which I could do on my own, and Aunt Martha helped shell beans and peas while Mama cut out fabric and fitted pieces and 'ran up' two new ones over a two day period.  I'm pretty sure that somewhere in there Aunt Martha managed to get a home perm done, as well...It was a packed two day visit, let me assure you.   When they left, she carried home with her two new dresses, a fresh head of curls, some garden produce and a jar or two of home canned goods.  Aunt Martha was the type who just couldn't leave someone's home without a little something to take back home with her.  It was a running, but loving, joke amongst the family that they'd best have something for her to take with her.  I was at my dad's sister's visiting one day when Aunt Martha and Uncle Hoyt arrived.  Apparently Uncle Hoyt was on a mission to get a part or something and hadn't planned a long visit.  Aunt Martha was apparently not aware that they wouldn't stay and visit a bit.  When he announced his intention of leaving, Aunt Martha said with near panic in her voice, \"Oh quick, Mary Jo!  Give me something to take home with me!\"  \"I haven't got a thing, Aunt Martha...\"  \"Give me a paper towel, I'll just wrap up one of these pickles out of this jar.\"   And she did!   Aunt Mary Jo and I laughed and laughed after she left.  Now Aunt Martha never met Josh but that little boy reminds me of her each time he comes to visit.  \"Can I take something home with me?\" he'll ask each time it's time to go.    He mightn't like pickles, but he'll happily accept a muffin or a piece of bubble gum, just so long as he doesn't have to leave empty handed.   And I always find him something and smile to myself and think of Aunt Martha.  The 'everybitcounts' challenge by Three Rivers Homestead made me think of how creative Granny got with drying apples and peaches.  She didn't have a fancy dehydrator.  She dried her apple slices the old fashioned way, on window screens in the yard in the sun.  She'd cover the screens with cheesecloth to keep the flies off the fruit.  When the humidity rose and the apples seemed to be taking longer than necessary to dry out, Granny pulled the car out of the shed, parked it in full sun and put the screens of apple slices inside the car, rolled up all the windows and let that do the job.   And it did!  I was thinking about this the other day as I blanched my handfuls (literally) of green beans to put into the freezer.    How creative we might get if we didn't have the modern day conveniences.  Of course, we can also use our ovens for drying as well, but Granny wasn't likely to run air conditioning and the oven didn't go on for much except baking pies or cakes and then only in the earliest morning hours in summer.I've shared before that my family were country folks and they put things away year round if they could.   Nuts and berries, stone fruits that grew naturally on the land, garden produce, fruit.   It was all preserved one way and another.  They knew where to forage to find what grew wild, like huckleberries and plums and muscadines and grapes and scuppernongs.  Big Mama had a big old crabapple tree, not a decorative one but a proper fruiting tree.  She gave a cutting to someone and I had a chance to get some of the fruit from it.I picked a 5 gallon bucket of crabapples from it one year and cooked the fruit to make juice and squeezed it out over a big pan.  I can't remember just why I had to leave home but I had to run an errand or something and when I returned the kitchen was spic and span clean and the pan that had held the juice was empty.  I asked my oldest daughter Amie where the juice was.  \"I thought it was dishwater so I poured it out...\" she said and I sat down and wept as I knew that was the last time I'd ever be able to pick from one of Big Mama's trees.  I thought of all the lovely jelly I wasn't going to get, lol.  Well, now it's just a funny story to tell so I guess I'm still getting fruit off that tree in one way or another, aren't I?Gracious this has been a nostalgic sort of visit...I guess I'd better finish up here and get on to doing other things.  I have supper to prepare and I'll wager that today I must pick Caleb up from nursery as the sky has remained steadily clear and it's not likely his daddy will be rained out of work today.Hope you've enjoyed this visit as much as I have!"},

{"title": "The Week Behind:  Keeping It Simple", "date": null, "text": "Saturday:  In my quest to find recipes for both pantry foods and current seasonal meals, I keep stumbling across recipes that have been made unnecessarily complicated.  Now I'm sure that in the realm of foods they taste amazing, but it's practicality that they lack.  I love cooking and I love learning to make new recipes but right now my focus is just not on how to make an old standard a gourmet treat.   So when I read a recipe for an onion dip that involved slicing two pounds of onion to caramelize and then having to make my own beef broth reduction, I rolled my eyes.  My motto for summer: keep it simple.  My motto for cooking from my pantry: keep it simple."},

HollandBut it's what she said after that really filled me with inspiration:Eventually we will get through this. We will be stronger. Hopefully you will have found a better you and more compassion and love for others.Surely an \"Amen!\" should follow that statement.Saturday:  Last night's Shortcake party was a success where little boys were concerned.  Millie had her first ever Shabat with us.   Bess touched a finger dipped in grape juice to baby girl's tongue and even put a tiny crumb of our Sabbath bread in her mouth.  As they were leaving I thanked Millie for taking her first Shabat with us and was rewarded with a big dimpling smile.  Oh my heart!Determined to take it easy today and so I did.  I didn't even make my bed properly.  Oh I smoothed out the sheets and pulled up the covers once the bed had aired, but no bothering with pillow shams and accent pillows."},

off last week before the hurricane of busy began I sent it out before I was done with my day.Josh's school keeps sending lots of vegetables home for them to eat.  Individual packets of cherry tomatoes, cucumber slices and carrots, whole English cucumbers, celery, etc.   The boys do like carrots and Isaac loves tomatoes as do Sam and Bess but they were overwhelmed with cucumbers which no one apparently eats.  I accepted all they had to offer, about 8 packets.  The slices of cucumber were very thick, so much so that I could easily slice each piece into 3 slices.  I made up an easy simple syrup with vinegar and sliced onions and packed it in a quart jar.   These are refrigerator pickles.In a quart jar, sliced cucumbers and onions packed as tightly as you can.   I added salt, pepper, and crushed red pepper today but you could add dill, garlic even bell pepper strips.  Mix 1 1/2 cups white vinegar with an equal amount of water and about 1/2 cup sugar.  Bring to a boil then pour over the cucumbers.  Put a lid on the jar and set into the fridge.  In a day or two you'll have a lovely fresh pickle that is a nice addition to sandwiches, or as a side dish.We went into town this afternoon to fill my car up with gasoline.  You know the routine: we took off the trash, went by the hardware store to pick up some needed items, then to the gas station.   We got lawn mower gas and filled up my car.  I noted the sign on the hardware store door that they needed help.  I know a young man who needs a job and this might be an answer.  I called to let Katie know their was an opening so she could pass word along.John asked if I'd like anything and I could have rolled out a laundry list of wants including going somewhere for supper but I said \"No, I haven't got need of a thing.\"  I came home and decided that tonight I wanted to make something easy but delicious...So glad I picked one of the frozen Aldi General Tso Chicken this past week.   It was just the indulgent sort of supper I wanted for tonight.  I served with leftover rice, egg rolls and should have sliced some cucumber but didn't...Saturday:    We both rose quite early this morning.  John was off to the men's meeting (held outside) at church and I was off to pick up Katie and go get Taylor.Once home yesterday afternoon, Katie cut our hair.  I was long past due a haircut as was John.  I'd gone so far as to snip random bits myself prior to Katie cutting my hair today.  I took her and Taylor home and then came back to wearily put the chicken and roast beef in the oven.  Uninspired and worn out.  It showed in our evening meal too.  It was lackluster and failed to please.I really ought to have just given in and gone to bed early but I did not.  Instead I sat here sulling up due to John's tiredness (he must have had a bad night) and boring tv.   It's a wonder to me  I never recognize that half the trouble I see in someone else can often be found in my own poor attitude. Sunday:  Slept until 9am and I'll not say I was Susie Sunshine when I got up either.  I stumbled to the kitchen to have coffee and lamented the fact that it was in a cup that prohibited my reheating it (gold leaf).  I had tears in my eyes most of the time I was sitting in my corner and I might as well have been IN the corner as I was a very tedious two year old this morning. Sam sent the boys over and must have instructed them hard that they could not stay because Josh literally handed me a card, hung over me as I opened it and then grabbed Isaac's hand and said \"Let's go...We're not staying!\"  Sigh.  No doubt the result of my bad mood the other evening when I snipped at Bess because the boys appeared unexpectedly.  More tears.  And the card by the way was one of those really beautiful pop up sort which made me cry, too, because I'd never thought I'd have such a lovely card, but that part was a good cry and not an 'oh me' sort of cry.John cooked breakfast as well he might since it was then gone 10am and I was obviously not making a move to do it.  Now traditionally he does cook breakfast for me each mother's day, his one concession to the day, since as he's fond of saying \"You're not my mother...\" and I'm not.  I have four children and he most certainly was not one of them, lol.  But still...I'll never know if he cooked breakfast for me because it was Mother's Day or if it was because he was just beyond hungry.  It doesn't really matter in the end, but I'd like to think he did it out of tradition.About the time I got ready to go pick up Katie, John decided that now at last was the time to clean up my car.  It needed cleaning pretty badly.  It also meant that now my schedule for the day had to revolve around HIS plans and I don't handle that sort of change gracefully when I feel well.   I'll leave it to your imagination how I felt about it when I was in a MOOD already.  However, it didn't sway his determination to clean my car one whit.  Given the inevitable, I hauled out the vacuum and cleaned floor mats, cleaned the windows and barely side stepped a proper row with John, sigh.  I came indoors pouring with sweat and trying to cool off so that I could head on to pick up Katie. COP two now ensued as John insisted I take a shower...I'd already had a shower!  But I finally decided that arguing was pointless and cool water would likely help to cool me off.  I was just stepping out when he came in to announce that HE was going to go get Taylor and Katie and would see me in a bit.And being the lovely creature that I was today, I laid my head down and wept and unloaded the dishwasher and brought in the clothes I'd hung out earlier to fold and waited and waited.   He returned literally moments before the time to leave the house to head up the road.My ill temper and weepiness hadn't a thing to do with anyone or anything.  It's just one of those moods I get in at times when I am tired and overwhelmed by all that I see should be done and some of it has to do with head speak I am listening to and  has nothing at all to do with anyone except myself. Well the day went on and I will say that the release of tears is always worth while if you can get an alone moment to release the pressure that held back tears creates. We took Taylor home.  We drove back, Katie and I, each in silence, as we had both confessed we were feeling rather ill tempered all around.  Sometimes you can be alone with someone and alone with yourself and I think it did us both a bit of good to be quiet together.Here's the productive things I did today:I stripped our bed and bath and then remade the bed and put out fresh towels in the bath.I washed a load of sheets and towels.  Then I noted that the red felt blanket that John has now replaced with a lovely new afghan that Amie knitted and mailed to him really needed a good wash.  I washed that and a couple of cloths I'd missed.  I hung them all to dry. I'd noted last week as I put the fitted sheet on the bed that while it went on well the elastic feels very much as though it's shot.  It felt no less so today as I hung it on the line and I have set it aside now that it's dry to try and figure out how to repair it.  The material has held up very well.  The elastic runs all the way around it but I think I can do the corners and make it work well enough. I washed a full load of dishes in the dishwasher.I put the chicken I roasted yesterday into the crockpot and set it on warm.  I noted that there was a full container of Macaroni salad.  I began to form a plan for our supper tonight...Made myself a peach smoothie for lunch.  Why have I not done this before?!  It was delicious.  I used peaches I'd frozen last summer, a bit of honey, Greek yogurt and milk.  It was really good and made for a quick lunch as I headed out the door.We cleaned up my car.  That was a savings of sorts but I'm not sure how much of a savings since John used his pressure washer, laundry detergent and we used our electricity to run the water and vacuum but it was awfully nice to have the car looking clean once more. I bought Katie a to go meal as her Mother's Day dinner on the way back home.  John and I  had supper at home.Watered outdoor plants. I've got either beans or zucchini coming up.  Couldn't tell you which.  I'm suspecting it's green beans.Monday:  Home school day.  It went okay, not as bad as last week, not as happily as I'd have liked it to go.  Josh apparently felt as out of sorts as I myself felt.  Made bread and bagels and did  some cleaning after Josh left.  I told John it was my gift to me as I knew the week ahead was to be a really hard one and having that one task that I normally reserve for end of week.   I just have a feeling that come end of the week, I'm going to be even less gung ho than I've been thus far this week.A British born friend of mine has episodes of what she calls evil head.  This day...Oh the evil head was large and wicked and reared regularly all through the afternoon.  Not much salvaged in this day.Tuesday:  Lolled all morning.  Ran all afternoon.   Took my book to read while Caleb had his pediatric appointment.  Unbeknownst to us, Isaac also had an appointment at nearly the same time.  I got to visit briefly with Bess and Isaac. Poor baby got a shot today and I heard him scream there in the parking lot.  He was fine by the time he came back to the car but little boy is NOT accustomed to being hurt. Katie sold some outgrown baby equipment on Facebook market place.  We met folks at a pre-arranged spot in town.   Then she had a phone interview for a job while in my car so I had to wait for her to complete that before I could leave her at her house.  The baby was incredibly good the whole while, only sighing deeply which is a family trait and made me and Katie grin at each other.It was gone past 6pm when I got home.  Made sandwiches for supper.Wednesday:   I thought John was working this day but I was confused.  However, just as well I mentioned it last night because he  corrected me then noted the day he was meant to work had been rescheduled with someone else working.  We're not mad.  This guy who took his place on the schedule is just back at work after surgery and it was his shift John was to cover.  I had scheduled a visit with Mama for today and so I left him at home and went off to do my duty.Wrote out the tithes before I left home and made sure to post those in the mail.The day was long, tedious and hard.  I was drained beyond words when I came in.  John made me coffee.  He made supper for me at my request.  It took three hours before I was really able to speak.  Here's the deal: these days are always difficult and hard and wearing beyond words but I hadn't realized how flat out depleted I was afterwards until John retired and was home when I came in after each visit.  It is what it is.  We don't either of us know what else to do about it except to just do what needs to be done and be glad it's over for the present, even if it is a wash and repeat sort of thing.Thursday:  Ugh.  Not the happy blog I'd like it to be this week but you know what?  Some weeks are just HARD.   I had an abysmal night's sleep.  I saw 4am before I finally went to the guest room and tried to sleep there.  John came to the guest room at 4:30am which woke me all over again.  He doesn't get in bed with me there he just checks that I'm okay.  Being a light sleeper is a curse.  He probably sat up in the living room the rest of the night, as he usually does when I am in the midst of one of these piss poor sleep cycles.   I woke at 7am freezing cold.  My nose was cold, my body was tense with cold and I ended up putting on a jacket after I dressed.   I contemplated what home school was going to be like with me having slept less than 3 hours all night long.  Decided I'd better lean hard on my Bible this morning and got busy doing that study.Glad I did because Josh came running into the house well before 9am this morning eager to start his day.  His daddy promised to take him fishing and so we worked and worked and worked.  We finished 12 worksheets today and that didn't include the talk about measurements and liquids and solids and such that we had while I fed the pets.Sam came to pick Josh up by 11:30.   Josh usually doesn't leave until nearly 12:30 most days by his own choice.  He was ready to finish up today and happily showed his dad his work and tools and put things away.  Sam asked John if he'd like to go fishing.  John declined saying \"Nope.  I've barely seen your Mama this week and we're going to do something.\"After they left John asked me what we could do.  I was prepared this time.  I mentioned a state park that isn't far from our home, about 40 minutes away.  It's in the mountains just north of us which always surprises us both that we are that close to what John calls mountains (I refer to them as foothills though some are quite steep!).   We took a picnic lunch and we found the park beautiful.  Did I have things I needed to do this afternoon?  Yep.  And a nap had seemed a good idea, too, but guess what?  Getting away for three hours was as good as a vacation and I mean that sincerely.  And while the nap was just a pipe dream the other jobs got done without much struggle and strain.  I've planned a lovely end to the day tomorrow which involves the boys.     I have to be away from home again tomorrow but it shouldn't be an all day thing.  And then I get a break of two whole days before the next week begins.Friday:  We woke well before 7am this morning.  That is because of the daylight that comes through the blinds.  I think, if I can remember to do it, that I'll shut the curtains tonight.  I normally leave them open at night because John dislikes a really dark room and I'm no fan of them either, but I'll just bet we sleep a wee bit longer if the curtains are closed.  And this weekend is my chance to catch up on all the rest I've missed this week.It didn't hurt to be up early.  I had asked Katie to let's do her grocery shopping early if we could.  Now Katie shops for a full month and when she goes she gets everything: WIC, food, any shopping that needs to be done for baby or Taylor, etc.  Today we went to five stores just for her shopping.   It was a long and wearing day even if I didn't go into each of the stores with her.  I didn't rush her, or at least tried not to do so.  She is hyper focused when she's shopping and shops very efficiently.  She's not a wanderer/looker sort.  She knows what she means to get and she goes right to it.I stopped at Kroger to get a turkey breast on sale for 99c a pound, something I've been watching for.  If I weren't already out of grocery money I'd have gotten two.  I have room in my freezer for it.  And if I have enough change in my purse I may stop again on Monday when we're back in the same area and see if I can't get another but I'm awfully glad to get the one I did.We went into Walmart together.  The purpose was to look for suitable clothing Katie might buy to wear to work but no luck there.  Nothing nearly as nice as what is on their website in that store. Unimpressed in that location anyway.  They are abysmal on WIC items allowed and the store is poorly laid out overall.   There was no sanitation for the buggies at all.  Katie and I both keep sanitizer in our purses and we used that.  All that said, she was able to get what she needed for Taylor and I got a pair of shoes for myself, a rather nice looking pair of black sandals for $8.  I haven't had a nice pair of black sandals for a couple of summers now so I was especially pleased to find these.I filled my car again this week.  Katie has a job interview and Caleb has a consultation with a specialist next week and Taylor will need to be picked up next weekend and taken back, too.  We're going to have to juggle a few things to have gas money for the rest of the month but that's fine.  It's just necessary stuff and no help for it and only for a short season.   I thought about all this yesterday when John and I 'escaped' for a bit.  \"We hadn't ought to spend the gas...\" I thought, but you know what?  I'm awfully glad we did!  I needed that break in the midst of this season of go go go.Tonight we're having a very quick and easy meal of hot dogs and that is mostly for the adults.  I've invited the boys and Bess to come over for a Strawberry Shortcake Supper.  I've made a shortbread (that turned into short crumbs) and a shortcake sponge (basically an old fashioned hot milk cake) and have cut and sweetened a load of berries.  It's going to be a fun and lovely way to finish off this week.   We'll have Shabat with the boys, likely earlier than it's meant to be but they love having Shabat with us.  How was your week?"},

What's in for 2020 that I'm interested in wearing?  Pearls.  Not the Barbara Cleaver choker type nor the 1920's flapper type but something with a fresh take on pearls.  John got me two sets of pearl earrings.  One set is a sort of charm that hangs from my gold hoop earrings.  Another set is a more natural looking pearl that is on a tiny french hook.  I love both pairs.  I also would love to get these from Analouisa.com .Saturday:  A quiet day at home which suited me just fine.   I reheated cinnamon rolls and cooked sausages for our breakfast this morning.  I took out a chuck roast last night with plans to make that for today's dinner.  No plan for lunch...and it bites me yet again."},

This week we had a bit of winter weather.   For us it means that we were cold with nights below freezing.   I'm not complaining..  We live in a fairly temperate area and any change from warm is usually welcomed with cries of joy from nearly everyone.  What we miss in snow and cold, we generally make up for with plenty of wet weather.  Last week we had rain every day for seven days.  It didn't rain non-stop but it did rain at some point every day or night.   This week we had three lovely very cold sunny days and then it warmed up and rained again and is still raining."},

In fact, the rest of this weekend will be fairly pleasant and all next week will feel even nicer.  Hot enough to not want to work but not so hot you can't enjoy the porch for a bit if it's shady and you've got an icy glass in one hand...and a fan in the other to keep the gnats away."},

Katie texted that she feels the 'funk' coming on.   Seeing as how I am now on day 10 of recovery, I don't believe she's going to be up to even such a small family meal as we'd planned.  I'll lay odds she opts to spend the day at home in bed resting hard, especially since she's on probation as a new hire and cannot miss work unless they send her home.   She'd told me on Friday that Matt is ill with the stuff as well...Ugh.  I'm most thoroughly sick of being sick and not feeling well and having family ill.  The little boys and Bess were not much better this past week and Isaac was sick in the night last night.  I am prone to agree that what we've likely had is flu given the duration of it for all households.

{"title": "In My Home This Week:  Full Speed Ahead", "date": null, "text": "Saturday:  I am both loving and not liking the rainy and partly cloudy days and nights we've had of late.  I've had to water the pots of plants in the yard only three times all summer long.  That is just plain lovely. The plants I have are literally leftovers that sprang up on their own this year.  I now have two pots of mint.  Did you know it blooms?  I didn't!The oregano is ungainly in length.  I cut several overly long stems and brought them indoors to strip the leaves.  I need to go out and harvest more now that batch is dried.  The rosemary has gained in girth and height.  A wonder of wonders really considering I had to pet the poor nearly dead plant back to life last summer.  It's so lovely to brush my hands over the stems as I go down the back steps and smell that wonderful aroma!Since I didn't have a chance to actually buy and plant anything this year, I'm especially grateful for the flowers that have chosen to reappear and the rain is to thank for that.  Rain, thunder and lightning too, have nutrients and minerals that water from the well doesn't have.  Plants thrive during a wet summer.Sunday: Washed and dried a load of clothes, most of them hung to dry.  It was plenty sunny and nice today, despite the humidity.  They were well dried by the time we returned from church.The stop at the grocery was not especially frugal.  The 'few items' I meant to put in the buggy weren't splurge items but golly did they add up!  Most were items I couldn't get at Aldi or which were more expensive at Aldi last week and therefore knocked off my list. What I bought today pushes me into next pay period's budgeted amount and so I shall 'cease and desist' before I do hard damage.I have a pretty good idea that we're going to be skipping buying groceries next pay period simply because I have so much on hand.  Funny how much less two eat than six and how far food goes when no one at all is home to eat it.  We weren't gone every day last week but we were out at least three different days and that made a big difference.  I won't plan hard on not spending  until I see how this week goes but with John starting a new work cycle on Tuesday, it's unlikely we'll spend as much time wandering away from home as we've been doing and more time settling down to what needs doing right here.I have made out a menu, mostly of things we haven't had this summer, things we'd normally have but the items were real dislikes for some of our family, or I had on hand but couldn't stretch.   We did a pretty good job of eating out of the freezer and pantry as a larger family and for that I'm grateful.  I don't court picky eaters, but I don't try to get anyone to eat anything that is an extreme dislike and will make changes to accommodate tastes if it's a mild dislike because in the end there is less to waste. However, I will be making up for lost time while the last of the summer season is upon us.I have a long list of projects to do, most all of which take more time and muscle than money.  Bess told me she'd read off the list the other day and it made her tired just thinking about it.  I laughed, but it is a lengthy list of things and I've added to it since then.   I've had plenty of time to see what was necessary over the past few months.  There's also plenty of deep cleaning to do.  I hope I can wash curtains this week.I am missing the little boys and their sweet smiles and the little moments I shared with each or both.  I miss having them both crowd onto my lap together to sit with me and rock.  I barely caught a glimpse of them this week and spoke to them yesterday while they sat in the car as the family stopped by on their way somewhere.  I swear Isaac's face is rounder than it was a week ago.  Josh and I talked for a moment but I didn't want to hold them too long, since it's so hot outdoors just now.  Life gets awfully busy when both parents are working and one little boy is in school.  I keep telling John these seasons with the children go quickly.Monday: I slept a little better last night than I'd been sleeping.  I had a painful knee all weekend long.  Saturday I took over the counter pain relievers without any noticeable difference.  Sunday I settled with a heating pad and that seemed to do better than any pain reliever. As we finished our breakfast we had a visit from Sam.  That was pleasant and we heard his plans for the house renovations which continue.  We also heard all about Josh's first school bus ride.  He was reluctant to go to school but he wanted to ride the bus.  Unfortunately he MISSED the bus this afternoon, some lack of communication error I think but fortunately Sam was home and went over to the school to pick him up.  Bess was mighty upset over it.  She'd gotten the call just as she arrived at work, but gracious goodness, he's not the first child to miss a bus nor will he be the last as I reassured her.  Someone would be with him at the school until one of us could fetch him.After Sam left, I felt ready to tackle the work of the day which is easy enough to want to do when the sun is shining.  I nearly let the heat and humidity outdoors quell my spirit but I didn't.   I hung out a load of clothes to dry.  It was so hot outdoors the towels were completely dry within two hours.  As I fed the pets, I noted how dirty the porches are.  Both need a good wash down as well as cleaning.  I weeded the flower bed in front of the back porch.  That was hot work as easy as the weeding.  I noticed that weeds were trying to take over all of the flower beds.  Fortunately they have been mulched and we've had plenty of rain so weeds come up easily.  I'll work on those flower beds  a little  over the week and soon have them back in shape, I think. I decided to wash all the kitchen curtains since the weather was so amendable to drying.  Hung on the line, the curtains don't wrinkle at all.  They were so very nearly dry, just barely damp in the thickest seams at the top when it began to thunder.  I brought them indoors and hung them at the windows.  I was sure they'd dry quickly here indoors and they might as well be hung on the curtain rods to finish off.For lunch today, I made John's favorite tuna pasta salad.  It's the only pasta salad he likes for me to make, because he says it's the only one I get just right, lol.  As I made lunch today, I thought about what I'd do tomorrow.  I want to make a few dishes ahead and get some things into the freezer for convenient easy meals.  We've eaten out a lot lately and even if we do pay for it from our allowances and share a sandwich at times, it's a whole lot cheaper to come home to a ready made meal.  I was thinking of making spaghetti and chili, as well as cooking the chicken carcasses that are in the freezer and picking over the bones.  I want to freeze the chili and spaghetti frozen in flat packets that will thaw more quickly.  I can make enchiladas from the chicken pieces and place those in packets of four, and possibly manage filling for a small chicken pot pie or a packet of chicken a la king, which I would freeze flat, as well.I need to reorganize my freezer. I've kept a gallon jug of ice in it to take with us when we grocery shop and had bagged up some ice for Bess to use until their icemaker was hooked up.  Things have gotten out of order and I don't know just what I have and what I don't.With all that thought out, I mopped floors today after lunch.  I decided my next cleaning task would be to deep clean the front entry and the dining area of our main room.  There will be no load of clothes to wash tomorrow, so I will do the curtains from the living and dining area and possibly one of the back rooms.   I have been using the shortest cycle to wash the curtains since it's mainly dust that is my concern, not deep ground in dirt.Now I am off to finish my book, D. E. Stevenson's Miss Buncle's Book which has kept me giggling as I enjoy small English village life and the characters who inhabit it.  I highly recommend this book and the three sequels that follow it.   I've been listening repeatedly to Leo Delibes.  You may not be aware of his name but you've likely heard  \"The Flower Duet\" in some form.  It's such a lovely piece.  I could almost imagine the composer sitting in the garden watching the flowers bow and bob in the breeze on a summer morning.Tuesday: I was up early this morning to see  John off to work.  As usual, I packed his lunch, made him coffee and breakfast here at home.  I used up the last of the blueberries in our morning oatmeal which was sweetened with maple syrup.  I highly recommend the combination of blueberries in oatmeal.  I like to heat the berries just enough that they pop with a warm juiciness in your mouth.Just as soon as John had left home I jumped to work.  I took down the curtains in the living and dining area and washed them.  Gracious but I sneezed and sneezed carrying those curtains to the laundry.  I guess they needed that washing!  By the time I'd loaded the dishwasher and made my bed and put things away and emptied trash cans the curtains were done washing and I was ready to hang them out on the line.  I decided that sweeping the porches was my next priority and I swept debris off the patio and pulled weeds that have grown there.  I have the loveliest moss growing in the edges of the patio next to the skirting in a perpetually damp area.  I'm convinced it's not good for the concrete but I do love a pretty  patch of green moss.  Apparently so do frogs and snails.  I was shocked at how quickly the weeds had grown in those same crevices, though.  I shouldn't have been with all the rain we've had, but I was just the same.After sweeping the porches and patio and doing a bit of weeding, I felt a shower was in order.  It was mighty humid and thick outdoors, the sort of humidity that makes your skin feel damp long before you start to sweat.  I was 'het up' by the time I got done with that little bit of outdoor work.  And 'et up,' too with the mosquitoes who'd found me their breakfast buffet of choice.Going to shower made me think of cleaning the shower stall with the vinegar/dishwashing liquid solution so I got that done and then took care of me.  John dislikes the smell of the solution which is one of those rare things he can smell distinctly and immediately, so I try to use it only when he is not in the house.  It works so very well but I don't like to leave it too long because the vinegar is corrosive on the metal drain.You might think that was quite enough work but I had planned to deep clean the dining and entry way.  I found myself decluttering first, something I'd not planned to do, but it presented itself.  I soon had emptied a drawer completely of everything in it.  I was able to better store John's mother's glassware and brought the candles in from the pantry closet where they'd been for months.  Incidentally, I  discovered the odd smell permeating the pantry were scented candles I'd bought last fall.  I rather liked them last year but not so much there in the pantry mid-summer.  I knew nothing there had spoiled but I had looked all over the pantry trying to determine the source of the almost curry like aroma permeating the closet.  Well, everywhere except the box of candles!I polished the buffet and set the top nicely with the antique lamps I'd gotten from Mama and the Challah platter that Katie and Sam had given me.  It looks so lovely and fresh.   That was my inspiration spot because  I cleaned and cleaned and it looked a right mess long before it looked nice again.  I hauled out the old dresser I'd made over as a record/CD storage.  John decided we'd have a new cabinet and we put in the order for it last night.  I got notice this morning that it had shipped so I figured I might as well move the old dresser and vacuum that spot well.  I'd like to move the filing cabinet out of the area but at present I cannot as it is where the printer must sit.  I have loathed that file cabinet for years upon years but it's been usable and we've kept it.  I can only juggle so many things around inside the house, lol.  Eventually I'm sure we will find something that will work as well and looks a good deal better.During one of my sit down and rest spells, I noted that the bookcases in the living area still looked awfully cluttered and decided I needed to do a deeper cull.  Result: one shelf which is now home to books that would not fit in the box of culled books.  But I know that everything on that shelf is going to be donated regardless of whether it looks full.  It was easier to cull books today for some reason than it was the other night when I tried to do the same job.  I was far more ruthless.  Books sitting around waiting to be read for years, books that were gifts but not to my taste, books that were copies of books I already had on hand.   It was hard but necessary and the result is that the bookshelves look much nicer.After I'd rested a bit, I took down our master bedroom and bath curtains and put them on to wash, rehung the clean fresh smelling living room curtains and then vacuumed all the rooms.  And last, I settled before the sewing machine to properly hem the slipcover I'd made for the little slipper chair I'd put in the kitchen sitting area.  I'd noted that there were numerous lose strings along the hem and was just going to trim them off, but realized I'd done a hasty job of hemming and hadn't done it properly so the strings were only going to reappear.  Now it looks much neater and nicer.About that time it began to thunder and the skies turned dark.  I hurried out to bring in the almost but not quite dry bedroom curtains, just as I'd had to do on Monday. Then I settled into my chair with a cup of coffee and put my feet up. Sam called to say he'd drop by for a few minutes with the boys.  I was tired but not too tired to see the children.  Josh was happy to see me and ran indoors hopping and jumping and telling me how much he liked school and how much fun it was to ride the bus and how he had a new superpower. Isaac was standoffish.  He acted so funny as he walked through the house.  Doors were open to room he'd not usually been in and he'd stand in the doorway and look hard and sort of kneel and look harder.  You'd have thought it a strange house and not where he'd just spent five months of his life.  The few changes that had been made seemed to confuse him though Josh quickly asked questions about items that were missing and noted what was new (the bench at the backdoor).Sam had been gone only minutes when it finally began to rain.  Somehow or other, the sound of rain made the house seem cold and I couldn't bring myself to look forward to a cold pasta salad without adding in a piece of hot buttered crisp toast to go with it. I've been at a complete loss this summer and last because of our local  peach packing shed closing down.  Even though I know that the peaches are being harvested and sold by a big name company under the guise of a local business, it's not in town and it just doesn't seem the same.  I mean, silly as it sounds, I have no way of knowing if I'm getting a real home grown peach from my county or one from any old orchard from any of the surrounding counties.   I miss knowing what I'm eating is right from my home soil. I broke down Sunday and bought peaches at the grocery, only my second taste of them this summer.  I've just enough left to make John a peach cobbler and I doubt we'll have another peach this year.  It makes me sad, because peach season, especially freestone peach season, has been the best six weeks of summer for me.  I must try to find a small local peach stand I guess and I shall pretend the peaches are from the home orchards even if they aren't.  Next summer....next summer I shall eat peaches every week of freestone season.  And put a few away in the freezer for winter days in January or February when a peach cobbler with fresh peaches is  true treat.I have been happy this evening.  I've seen the little boys, whom I'd begun to miss a good deal and I've a nice clean house about me.  I stumbled upon  \"Larkrise to Candleford\" on the BYU channel and thoroughly enjoyed it.  The sky is clear enough that I can see the sunset tonight which is bound to be lovely with the skies full of clouds.  I think I shall keep my promise to myself and go dig a few of the vintage magazines out to look through and read a few more chapters in my book and let the evening unwind slowly towards bedtime.Wednesday: Another day, another bit of work accomplished.  The ottoman I use is slip covered once again, this time without the ruffle and looking much more tailored.  I find that while I want feminine things in my home, I also don't want it full of pink ruffles either, although I am loving the current blush pink trend for accessories.   After I finished the slipcover, I hurried into the kitchen to make our dinner.  Bbq'd Chicken Wings and Potato salad, with a fresh Peach Cobbler.  Just as dinner got done, Sam ran down to borrow milk.  They were out and apparently Isaac is not fond of running out of milk, anymore than he likes to be hungry.  Unlike Josh, who would steadily refuse to eat for days as a one year old,  Isaac is not only wanting his meal,  he wants it on time as well.  None of this inexact business of eating whenever you feel like it.  8am, 12pm, and 5pm if you please and no lateness at all.  So the milk was all used this morning trying to calm him down until breakfast was ready.  Milk was needed for the rest of the day and it's the day before pay day.  Hence, the borrowed milk.I'd had the package of  chicken wings in the freezer for the past few months, certain it would never make enough for five to eat them,  It might not have stretched that far, but we had enough leftovers to make two more meals for us.  I'll keep one in the fridge to have over the weekend as a quick heat and eat meal and I've put one in the freezer for dinner entrée another day.  I'm always happy to have a few items in the freezer to make my life easier without the expense of buying anything ready frozen.   I still haven't made up my batch of freezer meals as I'd intended, but I shall be home alone again Friday and that might well prove to be my day.After lunch, I went to work on John's new pants meant for work.  Hemming, adding reinforcements and buttons to the area where his suspenders dig into the material.   I like to do a neat job of that reinforcing though John says he doesn't care what it looks like, as it shall stay hidden from view by his belt anyway, but I do the best job I can do just the same.  Sewing the buttons through the extra thicknesses of material is the hardest part but we've found the buttons keep the teeth in place so they don't slide off the pants altogether.   John doesn't mind a suspender losing it's grip when he's wearing jeans even though those things fly off in such a way they might give you a black eye, but he's no time for that sort of business when he's busy with a patient. It wasn't totally unpleasant working with the hand sewing task this afternoon, as John had found a lovely old black and white movie of \"Jane Eyre\" with Agnes Moorehead, Orson Welles and Joan Fontaine.  True to the book and really lovely.  Makes me long to read the book all over again, something I've not done in years.  I sobbed and sobbed when Jane's friend Helen died at school  when I first read the book fifty years ago and I've seldom made it through the book since without crying. What I didn't do last night, was get out my vintage magazines.  I decided that the ottoman must be slipcovered and in order to make good use of the remains of the oldest slipcover I had to pick apart the seams.  This netted me enough fabric to make the ottoman slipcover and avoid using the big section that  had worn thin and begun to tear.  I think, given that I paid  about $30 some years ago for the slipcover, it lasted rather well and has given good life.  Indeed it goes right on still, although in parts.  I watched a movie last night that was free for Amazon Prime customers, while I ripped seams.  It was okay, strictly low budget, simple clean story.  I can't even tell you the name of it at the moment, but it was nice.John and I have spent a little money this week.  I mentioned we'd bought a cabinet for the records.  We bought the bench at the backdoor.  We have also ordered a new mattress for our bed.  Our current mattress is barely four years old but it's a pillow top and has become mighty uncomfortable.  There are troughs in the mattress.   It's gotten increasingly more difficult to sleep upon and we always seem to arise with more aches and pains than we'd gone to bed with.   This mattress set cost us nearly big money and while it's 'good' for ten years it's very telling that the guarantee on return of money is just 100 days.    We're going the unconventional route this time and have ordered a mattress online, one of those compressed memory foam gel affairs.  Katie and her husband, and another couple who are friends of ours have them and rave over how comfortable they are.   John's EMS unit recently ordered the same sorts of mattress for the paramedics beds, too. We ordered ours from Overstock.We have said for years our next bed would be a king-sized one but we didn't order a king-size after all.  In the end, it came down to the fact that we've got two new sets of Queen sheets, a queen-size bedframe and a brand new mattress pad.  The mattress was reasonable but buying all those items added up to far more than we wanted to spend overall. Ordering a larger bed was not only going to be expensive but would require us to completely rearrange our room, too.  There's plenty enough work around here to do without making more! We decided that after all we've felt we had plenty of room in a queen-sized bed all these years and we'd be just fine with what we're accustomed.  And that's how we saved money, lol.Friday: Gracious!  It's just after 12pm and I am a tired woman already.  I've finished every item on my lengthy 'to do' list this morning and had  three phone  conversations, as well.  It was a mixed lot of news this morning.  I'm glad that I've had plenty of work to occupy my mind and that there were also the sorts of tasks that allowed me to think things out, as well. I wanted to share yesterday and this morning with you before I send this off.   Yesterday was my eye appointment.  On a whim, we stopped at a new vision place that is near a favorite grocery about two weeks ago to make an appointment for me to get an eye exam.  I'd noted I was having a little difficulty seeing lately and since it has been two years since my last exam, I wanted to go on and see if it was imagination or fact.  It turns out, it was fact.  Nothing dire wrong except a weaker left eye and hence the additional blurring and trouble seeing. John amused himself trying to pick out my next pair of glasses.  I really liked some of his selections but they didn't do a thing for me when I put them on.  In the end, I got full frames and they are not standard issue glasses.  I was happy that this place detailed what we were paying and what our insurance covered.  The last place never did that and we were left wondering what everything cost, or if the insurance covered anything at all.  No questions this time around.We walked next door to the grocery and picked up my prescription and then went up the frozen foods aisle.  Store brand turkey breasts were 99c a pound this week.  This is a typical cost in August and a good time to buy them in bulk if you've the space.  I don't have freezer space, but we'll get several meals off a breast and I can use some of the leftovers to make sandwiches.   I've promised John a late summer favorite: turkey and dressing.  I don't know why turkey and dressing always seems such a treat to me in August and February...Maybe because there are no real holidays in this month?   Usually in February it's because it's cold and that is such a hearty meal.  Maybe because I think, in August, that I need comfort food.  Or just possibly, because the turkey breasts are such a good buy and it seems a good dish to start a roasted turkey with.You know what?  The turkey breast was absolutely all that we bought.  No kidding!  My prescription is very inexpensive (under $5) so that's no strain to pay out of pocket money.  The turkey breast wasn't much over $6. We came home, me wearing sunglasses over my glasses with the dark film glasses they'd given me at the vision place behind my glasses.  I was comfortable like that and had no problems seeing.   It was funny that even with my eyes dilated, I blinked when they turned on the lights during the exam, but John literally jumped.  His eyes are sensitive to light and always have been and going from dark to bright hurts him. I realized how much I wasn't seeing however, when we arrived home....I could see things on the back porch.  No shock since I've hauled furniture out of the house this week.  But John kept talking about packages.  I couldn't see any packages so I figured it was a small box.  Well there was a small box but there were also two big packages.  Our new mattress and the new display cabinet had arrived.  Also arrived was my favorite cold weather scent from CVS.  I'd discovered the perfume was the same cost there as at the discounted fragrance site.  I was able to use coupons and my extra cash bucks to get an even better price on  it. Now the perfume is a 'fun' thing but the other two items were for the house and that means a great deal to me.  We don't get anything new for the house, bigger items, that often.  John opened the display case right away after we got it indoors and started to work assembling it.  It took him about 1 1/2 hours to put it together and only a Phillips head screw driver.   We ordered it from Sauder because we have bookcases I've had for 26 years in the living room that are from Sauder and they look as good as ever.  I was so impressed with this display cabinet.  There were NO raw edges, every piece perfectly finished, and the instructions were easy to understand for all but hinges and magnets.  We figured those out on our own.  I was so pleased this morning to put the records and CDs in the cabinet and find we have room to spare...Now to just get rid of that ugly old file cabinet next to it! I made us a quick supper of burgers and oven fries and a pot of coffee.  As we'd worked it had begun to thunder and eventually poured rain.   I'd been thinking I'd need to water the Hibiscus but it got plenty of rain last night.   The rain was so heavy it caused the electricity to continually flicker as though we were about to lose power at any moment.  John decided that was a good time to put the new mattress upon our bed.The mattress came in a big black duffle bag.  It was so heavy I doubted we'd manage to get it on the bed.  Well once the plastic wrap was off the mattress, it began to expand and oddly it got lighter as it expanded.   I told John I couldn't understand it and he, clever man, used an example I could understand.  He said it was no different than biscuit dough rising into a nice light biscuit as it filled with warm air.  Now that I understand very well.I can say honestly that sleep last night was easy and I woke this morning without the much accustomed aches and pains I'd been experiencing of late.  We ordered a firm mattress and I would not change that.  You sink lightly into the mattress because it is soft.  It made me quite glad we'd chosen firm rather than medium or soft.This morning, I did the usual routine: breakfast, coffee, lunch packed and sent John off to work.  I started a load of clothes to hang on the line.  I hung them out quite early but 5 hours later I brought them indoors slightly damp still.  Into the dryer they went.  Because I had used a portion of the ground beef to make hamburgers, I couldn't make both spaghetti sauce and chili.  I decided upon chili, so I started that this morning, as well as putting the chicken carcass to boil.   That netted me 3 cups of chicken meat and 2 pints of broth, plus enough to make dressing and gravy for our turkey dinner tomorrow.I found I had quite a lot of clearing up to do this morning and my list was long overall.  Happily everything on it is done except determining the solution to that black file cabinet.  John has, quite rightly, put the brakes upon spending further money on household things at this time so it's up to me to find something I can easily afford from my allowance.Oh dear.  We've just had a quick rain shower come through and a moment ago, as I looked out the window at the now sunlit yard, I heard a sudden POP followed by a loud crack of thunder...Lost my TV to it.  So I'm closing down.  So glad this computer has battery power and wasn't connected to charge."},

{"title": "Transparency", "date": null, "text": "I have always loved those pages in Encyclopedias where you open the page up and there is the skeletal system, then you turn a clear page and there are the organs, then another page layers on the muscular system and finally you turn the last page and there is skin and hair and a person.   As I've studied genealogy I've wished often for such transparency sheets to overlay maps of the states where my ancestors lived.  So often it appears they have moved but what changed was boundary lines, new counties formed, old townships died and faded away and the relative rarely left the place in which they had settled after migration from another state.I have often said with my blog that I wanted to share myself with you all.  To be transparent.  Who I was, where I am in my mind/spirit/life span, my financial circumstances, my talents, my lacks of talents, my hopes and my loss of dreams.  I have tried to do so without revealing personal information that might be irresponsible. But I've also wanted to share a little more.  It has actually been on my heart and mind now for a number of  months that I needed to go deeper in sharing myself, my very inner self, though you might well think I've done quite enough of that already.I want to be transparent to you as much as I can without causing harm to others who may have intentionally or unintentionally done me damage, or revealing things that are more reflective of the character of another than myself.  It's one thing to share my failures and failings and foibles.  It's mean spirited to share those of others.  At least in a more or less public setting, I've found it especially difficult to balance the pointing out of my failures without revealing what caused the situation in the first place."},

The renovation on the house began this week.  It's looking like it might be a little longer than hoped, as I'd suspected it would be because every reality reno show I've ever seen has proved to be just so.  That is my full extent of experience with such but it's enough.   Bess came back from a couple of hours of work on her own feeling a bit discouraged.  There are missing walls, and problems in floors and a myriad of other things that must be dealt with and that's just one small portion of all that needs to be done.  At this point Sam is again questioning the wisdom of even attempting to sink any money at all into the project.  He'd meant to do only a portion of the work.  The rest was meant to wait until they move in but it's now looking as though most of it must be done to just make it acceptable as a house.  And it's  hard to see devastation and believe it's going to be home."},

One day I discovered he really liked fruit with a serving of cottage cheese on top.  Can't buy those in a cute little individual cup...so I compromised again.  I bought cottage cheese and went back to portioning out cans of fruit into individual jars with a scoop of cottage cheese from a tub.  Even buying canned fruit and a tub of cottage cheese was less than buying just the individual fruit cups.  I went right back to saving money."},

I'm at that stage where things feel a bit much: too much to do, too little time to do it all in.  But I don't want to lose sight of what this season is really meant to be about.   Our church passed out books to each family this season to use for Advent."},

How was your Thanksgiving?  Ours was super busy and super nice.  I had 3 of my 4 children at home and 6 of my 10 grandchildren.   Our dinner guests were 18 in number for dinner and 14 for supper.   Thankfully there were plenty of leftovers to serve for supper. And enough leftover  still to put dressing and sweet potato casserole into the freezer.   Taylor barely ate which is odd for her.   But Isaac...That little boy put down bite for bite every bit as much as all the other children together from start right through to dessert for a finish.  And my but he was happy over it!   It wasn't long before Gramma had him down for a nap after that big meal.  He's going to do well with Thanksgiving traditions, taking his nap after eating turkey, isn't he?"},

In case you haven't seen them, I thought you might like to look them over, too.  Personally,  I think these are pretty items  that would make wonderful gifts for a wedding shower or a housewarming , as well as Christmas gifts.  They are under $30 for the most part, with a few under $20 and I thought I'd featurethem here just in case any of you have gift giving occasions coming up.   Metallics are very popular just now.  Brass is enjoying a resurgence in décor favor and copper is as well.  Gold and silver tend to remain popular.  All the pieces I've featured here are gold in color and that's partly why they caught my eye, because I knew they were current.  I think the designs are nice and classic and will therefore fit with most décor styles."},

If a week is what you make it, then I was determined to make something of this one despite not feeling well for the first few days.  In the end, I accomplished some tasks, though not all the heavy duty stuff I'd anticipated doing.  I had some leisure time.  I  made meals.  It was a week."},

Huber shares her early life of travel and of learning to appreciate beautiful, locally grown foods.  She shares her Christian walk.  She shares her physical travels.  She shares her She shares memorable meals she's made over the years.  She even shares a few recipes, though just a few at the end of the chapter, one or sometimes two, not many but enough.  The recipes are not the sole focus of the book.  They weren't meant to be.  It's about a journey, both physical and spiritual and food just plays a natural role in that journey.I highly recommend the book if you happen to be a foodie, a Christian or someone on a spiritual journey, or if you love travel or coming of age stories.  That this book just happens to include recipes too is a bonus to all the rest.This book was provided to me courtesy Bloggingforbooks.com"},
{"title": "Giving When Funds Are Tight", "date": null, "text": "I think one of the most beneficial things we can do is to give to others.  Why is it beneficial?  Because it switches our focus from what we don't have to what we do have.  Often we get caught up in the feeling that we lack abundance.  Giving switches that focus of 'not enough' to 'more than enough'.    That said, I know that there have been times in our life when giving financially was asking way too much of our over stretched funds.  We never let that stop our giving.So how did we do it?In my home this week......I decided the blog was due a fresh perspective.  I thought it would be a good change to bring together \"This Week In My Home\" with \"Living Well\". One of the reasons for the change is that often I don't make the meals I share early in the week.  I thought it would be better to share what we actually eat.  Then too, there was the work.  It was great incentive to share a list of jobs I wanted to do with you all, but there were additional jobs I didn't share that were pretty big jobs.  I'd much rather tell you what I did do, especially on those weeks when I might not have accomplished my listed work.  I'd at least like for you to know why I didn't get things done!"},

Here is one benefit to the lack of rain.  The birds flock to the bird bath to bath or drink.  This week it was mostly Blue Jays who visited.  I watched Friday afternoon as one turned from the bath after drinking, his beak still glistening in the sunlight before he flew off.  A few minutes later it was a Brown Thrasher which is our state bird and most aptly named as it wears a decidedly brown suit of feathers and it makes a huge noise when it's seeking food on the ground as it 'thrashes' about in the dead leaves.  On days when the windows are open and the sheers have been pulled back, I can see the birds clearly but other days I catch silhouettes more than color."},

No, it's not a difficult book.  It's written clearly and feels as though I'm in a personal conversation but the content of what he's saying makes me stop and examine myself and my relationship and my ideals and adjust them as I feel led after the soul searching.I recommend this book to anyone who is wandering why you are stuck, or who wonders if you really do have a mission in life or how you will ever hear from God. Saturday:  We slept in this morning, something we seem to do more and more of lately.  It's very unusual for us to sleep beyond 7am and to make it until 8am is really something.  Kinda nice though on Saturday morning, agreed?Watched what there was of sunrise.  It lightened up.  But sunset was worth viewing.I didn't do any dinner prep yesterday, but dinner was easy enough.  I chopped butternut squash and onion and an apple, halved some petite potatoes and nestled these all around a whole chicken that was well seasoned.  I poured a little apple cider in the pan and then salt and peppered the vegetables.  I let it cook slow in the oven then cranked up the heat for a half hour at the end so the skin on the chicken would crisp and the edges of the vegetables would brown a bit.  Oh my!  Cider Braised Chicken is so very good.Not a very clear picture but there's a reason why I wanted you to see my bulletin board a little more closely...Back in the summer, I wrote about my desire to refresh my embroidery skills.  Well I had a lovely surprise from a reader who told me she'd been decluttering her craft room and she had a 'few' embroidery items she'd love to share with me.  She understated 'a few'!"},

Spruce up the door wreaths to look more autumnal.  Especially now that so many leaves have started to turn color and fall.Post the bills after we get check in the bank.  Banks are closed Monday.Grocery day worked in here somewhere.Continue work on the porches.  I got the front porch porch siding cleaned and washed windows there last week.  I ran the soapy brush over the porch and along the algae rails but they need more scrubbing.  I didn't do anything to the back porch last week at all.Go by Kroger and see if the Ball jars are still buy one case get one case free as they were last week.  This is a clearance item.  I'd like another two cases of the wide mouth quart jars which are very handy to have for storage.  I'll pick up my two free Friday download items while I'm in there.I have $6 in ECB for CVS that I'd like to spend but must do so before Tuesday is over.Gather a load of stuff to take out to the shed.Start a restock list of supplements and vitamins, so I'll know what must be ordered.  And place the order!Make John's requested cookies.I have a day out with Mama on the calendarStart working on the Jamberry party I'm hosting October 23-27.  Pay attention girls who want to join in.  You can find me on Facebook.   I'm planning party games and my theme is all things Fall.  Jamberry has introduced some new products and is expanding their line to include some cosmetics I think.  They've just introduced a matte finish lipstick line.  Message me here or put in a friend request on Facebook if you'd like to join in.While I'm out this week I hope to find some more mums to replace the two that dried up in the stupid heat last week.   I think I can deadhead and trim and then  replant them but they do not look nice enough to be there in front of the back porch.  I'll see what I can find that's suitable.  I should be able to start adding some pansies and possibly parsley to the area about now....I plan meals...though I don't know why I bother!No, I haven't had good luck of late in making the planned meals.  I'm constantly failing to prep ahead, or even to thaw meat a day earlier than it's wanted.  Then John will decide he wants to go out to eat or wants a certain something that wasn't on the menu.  I know I'll be eating out at least twice this week and possibly a third time when we're out getting groceries unless I plan ahead to have something quick and easy.  I've already shared our meal for Saturday...I guess I'll plan a couple of meals just in case.We still have a bit of egg salad and pimento cheese left for sandwiches.  I'll make some chicken salad as well since I cooked extra chicken breasts on Saturday.  We also have some Marinated Smoked Turkey and Cheese sandwiches in the freezer as well as some Chicken Noodle Soup so suppers are pretty much taken care of this week.Chicken Pot Pie, Pear Salad, Cranberry JellyFancy Pants Burgers, Mashed Potatoes, Green Beans, Garlic ToastI never did get to make this meal and I really was looking forward to having it.Pan Roasted Chicken Apple Sausages and Vegetables, Green Salad, Gingerbread with Whipped CreamI usually buy turkey sausage and they have a tendency to get very dry when pan roasting.  I expect the same of these Chicken Sausages.   For this reason I'll start the pan of vegetables with a foil cover and then just let the sausages and vegetables brown a bit under the broiler afterwards.   I'll use butternut squash, onions, apples and perhaps a potato or two.  I'll use a little apple cider in the pan to steam them....I plan my leisure:And again...why bother?  Honestly last week my leisure looked like a round of 1 each on my favorite games at the end of some long days.  I didn't do any of the things I'd thought I'd might but I did enjoy a glass of iced tea on the porch after I'd finished cleaning.  Hardly felt like leisure as much as necessary so I could keep going that day.  Oh yes, I did manage to work my way through the September issue of modern day magazines I had stacked by my chair. And one vintage October issue.  I did that yesterday.This week I hope to:have a spa morning.  I want to do a proper mani and pedi and put some wraps on those fingers and toes!Really.  Work on genealogy.  I'm yearning to do this.Read the next book in my October pile.  I forgot but I did read a book last week.  When I was all done I sighed deeply and John asked me why.  I told him I'd just finished my book.  He told me he was sorry.  I told him it was the last book in that particular series and he looked concerned and said he was very sorry, lol.   About how I felt about it myself.What have you planned for your week?"},

{"title": "Living Frugally and Well:  Summer Breezes", "date": null, "text": "Saturday:  Played it smart this morning: baked a cake, cooked biscuits and started a chicken roasting in the oven early this morning.  The cake went in first and the biscuits and chicken went in as the cake came out.  Cakes like dry heat in an oven, while pies and muffins and breads don't mind moist heat at all and can be baked all at once if need be.Wish I had remember to start the zucchini while the oven was going.  I didn't and so I heated it up again nearer midday and boy was that a mistake.  It warmed the house up, made the AC run harder than it would have done and necessitated turning on room fans as well as upping the speed on our ceiling fans.  Sigh...Noted and will be sure to pay attention to that in the future!"},
{"title": "In the Good Ol' Summertime:  Water Play", "date": null, "text": "As a child, summertime was hardly summer if water wasn't involved in some way.  My father was a little afraid of water.  I've no idea why but he was, so we were banned from going down river with Granddaddy when he fished in the river swamp.  He also wasn't keen on our going into the swimming pool, either.  Since I've pretty much spent all my life in the country not going to the swimming pool was far more common than going.There were other substitutes for the elusive pools in our lives like getting wet under the water hose or running through the sprinkler, all of which suited us admirably.  Not something we got to do nearly often enough because when you live in the country the pump runs on electricity and wells have a nasty habit of running dry.  Water was to be conserved...But I must say that aside from Granny I've never known but one other who had a well run dry.  Granny's wells were generally near the surface hence the running dry (you pay per foot for the drilling).  As well, she watered the cows daily so there was already a tax upon her well and electric bill that most didn't have to worry over."},

That's the COP part of the title.  Change of Plan.  I wasn't upset about the cancellation.  The truth is, I saw it as a gift.A few weeks ago, our music leader pastored for the day.  He gave a rousing good sermon about sacrifices and what we're willing to give God and what we aren't.  I was convicted twice already in telling others that I really needed alone time and so I generally stayed home on the Sundays John was at work.  The people with whom I shared this didn't say a word, nor even look at me hard.  It was a conviction I felt deep down in my spirit that something was wrong with that statement.  And then I heard Pastor Jason's sermon.  It wasn't that he stepped on my toes...but he surely opened up my heart and revealed to me why I had been wrong."},
{"title": "Summer Eating:  Vegetable Salads", "date": null, "text": "Yesterday for dinner, I served a 3 Bean Salad.  My salad was from a can but it was quite good and nice and cool.  It made me think of other salads that have no lettuce.  It seemed a category worth exploring for cool summer eating.I have a recipe I haven't made in quite a few years.  It is made up of fresh green beans steamed but still quite crisp.  One the beans are cooled, add diced tomato and make up a vinaigrette to dress the salad.  Chill.This week in my home......I am amazed but the weather men have been on a roll of late in predicting the weather rightly.  There is a chance of showers every day.  Every day it rains just enough to soak plants.  The flowers are so appreciative they are just overflowing with blooms.  April showers may bring May flowers but July showers bring a frenzy of summer blooms and I'm loving it!  Who knew what a mild summer with rain could be like?  I'd gotten so accustomed to last summer's hot dry wind and lack of rain where everything curls up and turns brown right away.  Our temperatures are not meant to get much above the high  80s  (the 'feels like' temperatures are much higher) which is unheard of for this time of year."},

I focus on seven areas of my life: Spirit, Marriage, Family, Self, Home, Blog, Finances.  You can certainly choose any focus areas you like and be even more specific than I've been if you'd like.  These are the areas I have chosen to focus on for the past few years."},

{"title": "Book Review:  As Kingfishers Catch Fire by Eugene H. Peterson", "date": null, "text": "I wanted a book to make me think a little more deeply about God and this book has certainly done that.  It's a series of sermons that Peterson preached over the years after he'd found a deeper personal  relationship God.  He longed to impart that feeling of personal relationship to his parishioners and I think he succeeded well. I'm pleased to say that while there are many insights I'd have been sadder for missing, the book is not written in a complicated theological language.  It's written in laymen's terms, easy to understand, but with all the depth that an experienced pastor would bring to a hungry congregation.This book is lovely and well worth the time to read.  Because it's set up in sections you can easily read scriptures consecutively that tell the story Peterson is aptly retelling.  It's set up in chapters, with breaks, so that one might easily pause in reading and take it up a little later when a point requires further pondering.I'm very pleased with this book and think it will become a well loved 'friend' upon my bookshelf, referred to again and again through the years.Thank you to Blogging for Books for sending  the book as a consideration for review purposes."},
{"title": "In the Good Ol' Summertime - Porches", "date": null, "text": "I seriously cannot remember a summer with any of my grandparents where the porch didn't figure prominently in memory.Granny's favored seating area was on a side porch, where people tended to come if they weren't family.  She kept four chairs on that porch  and a handy set of stackable chairs just inside the door.  Also  just inside that front door was a stack of hand held paper fans.  These were mostly passed out by some local funeral service and featured photos of  guardian angels holding infants from tumbling over a cliff...you know lighthearted themes like that. Granny's porch happened to be on the shady side of the house and overlooked her garden and flower beds.  This only added to the ambience of the porch.  It was always peaceful there and I say truly I spent many and many an hour on the porch with her as a child and as an adult.  Many of my deepest life problems were sorted out and many a heart ache soothed there."},

{"title": "Keeping Cool or I Love Air Conditioning", "date": null, "text": "I mentioned in this week's Iced Tea Chat that I love air conditioning but you know the first years of marriage I lived without it. Not just during my first marriage but also the first five years John and I were married, too.  We had window units but to run them cost more than we could afford.  Our house  was set up to allow for cross breezes.  That's one fault to be found with many modern homes, you know.  I remember Big Mama's home was built with plenty of doorways and windows that allowed air to flow from one room to another.  Yes, there was a loss of some privacy since bedrooms opened off one another but not so much that  you were bothered by it.  And the result was a home that was somewhat cooler even in deep summer heat and a good bit warmer in the winter too because the heat could flow better.How did we keep cool?  Oh there was a science to it!  It mostly employed using what we had and doing all we could to insure the indoors stayed cooler than the outdoors, no easy feat.We put up reflective shades on the sunny side of the house.   My 'reflective shades' were mostly sheets of cardboard with aluminum foil over them.  On the big patio doors it was just straight sheets of heavy duty aluminum which was wider.   I use duct tape to hold in to the glass.  You'd be surprised how well this worked.  Of course, the taped on foil did not get moved on a daily basis but the foil covered boards were moved from the shady window to the sunny one.  I'd say it helped reduce the indoor temperature by at least 10 degrees.  That's pretty substantial if it's 100F outdoors!"},

I'm not completely able to see without them but doggone it I can't afford to wreck them while I fight off gnats either.I walked down to the mailbox later to put in some outgoing mail and ended hiking up the neck of  my tee shirt so that I could cover my ears.  That was a help.  It made me think that a scarf wrapped about my head  might be the solution when working in the yard.  If you wonder why I'm not using any sort of repellant it's merely because I have had an abundance of purchases and birthdays (with three still to go this month) and our leeway has given out in the budget.  Gnats are not life threatening, just tiny irritations.  I will say however, if anyone were to be minded to try torture I'd start with mosquitoes and gnats.  Forget the old tricks of slivers of bamboo under nails or those torture stretching rack things (which John always thought looked rather therapeutic, lol, he always says it looks like it would pull kinks out of your back rather nicely).  Just shut me out in the yard with a thick cloud of tiny buzzing insects all about and I'd probably spill state secrets if I knew any!Well that got me thinking about all sorts of things.  Tiny irritations are enough to break a person if they keep right on being permanently irritating but most things of that nature we do build up some tolerance for in the end, now don't we?  I expect the first 24 hours would be the hardest and thereafter I'd be coping a bit better.  It's the way we're made that makes the first onslaught so hard and then we learn to just deal with it. But what about those tangled webs?  I am really talking dense spider webs of relationship patterns. Two years ago, when I was laid up in the hospital, there were three people conspicuously missing in well wishes and support.  I can tell you honestly that of the three there was not one good reason why any one of them couldn't have been there for a visit at least once.  Of the three, one made a phone call to let me know that my illness was an inconvenience to their personal life plans.   In no manner could these three be bothered to go our of their way to actually wish me well.  It was very sobering.  It brought home to me the number of days I'd devoted time and energy to these people in trying to build solid relationships and how often I'd accepted less than nice behavior in return.  Honestly, petty as it may sound to some of you, there's nothing quite like not knowing if you're going to live through the next 24 hours and noting that of the people who reach out, three in conspicuously important  relationships with you are silent.  I get all the 'Well some people don't know how to tell you how they feel...\" etc.  I do understand that some are just reluctant to be near illness.  I get that.  This was not the case in either of these three situations.  They've done this plenty for many people in their lives. So yes, it took some deep and serious thought.   I had to let go of bitterness and fully forgive.  It's a bit like trying to rid yourself of mice or some other particularly pesky  destroying thing.  You think it's all eradicated and you start finding evidence elsewhere in your life that you aren't done yet.  It's painful and it gets wearying but you have to continue to do all you can or it takes over, and it does mean to take over.   Bitterness and strife and unforgiving attitudes do nothing at all to harm those who inflicted the pain but it is physically and spiritually poison to the one who decides to live in it.  It's a bit like playing in poop and then wondering what stinks and why you're infected.Well as it turned out, of those three relationships, one is exactly as it was before.  It's in name only, truly. It was I who held on to the relationship and I was all alone in holding on.  I live in a small town, a small southern town at that.  There's a pattern for introductory conversation.  Southerners want to establish relationship with people.  They start by asking \"Who are your people?\"  because families in small towns and rural counties intertwine throughout the years.  My cousin marries yours, or your aunt happens to be my great grandmother or even the looser connections, my butcher is your brother in law's first cousin.  It all counts as connection.  In a rural Southern area we 'claim' folks as kin even if the relationship is diluted by several generations and branches off multiple times.   In this particular close blood relationship where DNA is beyond evident, to have someone look at me and say, \"I've known 'x' for thirty years and never knew you were family...\" it pretty much sums up how close we aren't and never will be.   Of the second relationship I've never seen the person again.  Nor heard another word.  It was as though I really had died as far as these first two relationships are concerned, as though who I am today is a ghost to them, an embarrassment of vapor that  will not pass on to the other side.And then there is the third relationship.  It's not a relationship I want to completely write off.  It too is a close blood relationship.  I want to tell you it's because I respect this person but that's not really all of the  truth.  I do have respect for some of the things done, for the relationship itself, but if it were not blood relation  I would absolutely walk away.  I've been asked before, \"If this were a stranger named Smith would it matter?  Would you let Stranger Smith treat you in such a way?\"I'd say it was a matter of admiration of the individual , because I do admire some of the things this person has done in life.  But that too isn't completely true.  There are a lot of things this person has done to destroy relationships between others and succeeded quite well in doing.  There are a lot of petty jealousies and hurts that have garnered retaliations that were embarrassing and painful and extremely hurtful.  There are a lot of resentments that one is expected to make up for, even while being assured that you never can make up for them.  It is a relationship in which one is expected to sacrifice all other relationships because no other shall have any importance compared to this one and if you so much as hint that another is at least equal, we're right back to the retaliatory behavior.  That may mean physical as well as verbal abuse or it can mean being cut off completely until you are deemed necessary once more.That is not to say that I hadn't realized long ago that I needed hard boundaries with this person.  I created many and after that late spring 2015 crisis I realized that my boundaries needed to be still tighter and built with greater fortification.  I won't tell you it isn't hard.  I long to do certain things but I can't because if I do, the walls are breached immediately.  It's that insidious a relationship between us. What brought all this to head over the past week has been an ongoing physical deterioration of the individual. It is a concern.  I made a suggestion of something helpful and perfectly reasonable and offered to attend to it immediately.  I was told no, as I have been told no  to every reasonable suggestion that would help.    Seven days later, I get a phone call and it was suggested that now the suggestion is valid and it would be a good time for me to tend to it.   Only it wasn't a good time to go ahead.  I discovered in questioning that I'd have to travel many miles, and attempt to contact several people to get key items that were necessary to perform the act and none of the preliminary work that might have been done had been.  It wasn't that it was just an inconvenience at that moment but what would have taken an hour at best the week before would require at least a full day of my time at that moment.  I had not been feeling well and  I said apologetically that I couldn't do it.  I suggested an alternative that required much less time on any one person's part or merely asking the person who lives with them to tend to it.Not only did I feel guilty in saying no, I could hear the disappointment that I wasn't willing to just drop everything at that moment and do as told as I would have done in the past.  It was obvious I was not playing the game and it was considered not fair play on my part.  I struggled with all sorts of things as I said, spiritually and mentally and emotionally and thought I'd ought to just give in when John put his foot down and said \"No.  Absolutely no.\"  Unreasonably, I felt even more torn and resented his thinking he had the right to say no. So to insure that I didn't, my body immediately reacted to the stress.  I've had a bout of a painful condition that isn't life threatening but does drain my energy and leave me unable to attend to my household.   It also insures I don't leave my home.   I've laid about and been depressed and been sharp and irritable.   My mental anguish had become physical and I knew I literally needed to heal in more ways than one.And so this week I ran smack into my own fortifications and it hurt like running headlong into a stone wall should.  It made me mad and sad. It left me confused and questioning my own wisdom and my Christianity and the very core beliefs that I not only espouse but try to live by.  It hurts to say that this person is my enemy but it's truth.  Because you see, however much I've built up my walls, this person knows full well that I am weak somewhere and is seeking that weak area where I break.  I've called this person my torturer in the past and it's truth.  The behavior that drove me to build my walls has not changed one whit.  The manipulations have changed slightly, a reaction to the changes I wrought in distancing myself from certain behaviors two years ago.  But the enemy still lies in wait.I cried out to God asking why this is so, asked how I can cope and asked what I should do.  \"Give me a sign, just one sign, that tells me how to proceed!  Please!\"   And the answer came, but it was hard to understand at first.  \"Heap coals on your enemy's  head.\"    Heaping coals on his head does not mean to set fire to this person, which sounds harsh enough to be mildly satisfying in nature,  but is actually a charitable act. A pastor explained  in a sermon we heard this past weekend:   In the old testament days, when  cold days came, beggars who had no money for wood would walk the streets with a flat pan on their heads and beg for embers.  People would drop a live coal onto the pan as the beggar walked past their window. He took his coals, went home and cooked his meal and warmed his home.  So I am to be charitable, not vengeful.In the New Testament, Paul instructs us to do all we do with love, because he says that all we do without love is meaningless.  Had I no love at all, it wouldn't matter how this relationship goes on would it?  I wouldn't struggle so hard to forgive, to try to forget and to wipe away every bit of bitterness.  I had no choosing in the loss of the two other relationships.  In each instance, I was dropped out of that person's life by none but themselves.  I didn't remove myself. I simply stopped being pushy about being given a place in their lives.  But in this last relationship,  I am entangled in a web.  I continue to hold onto a stubborn hope that things will change.  I seem to feel that if this relationship too is a failure it makes me a failure. The truth is, I haven't chutzpah enough to cut it off completely because I am certain it would make me a horrible, terrible person.It's not all untangled to my satisfaction but it's the best understanding I have at this time.  And so I struggle to determine just how I must act within my safe boundary and do what I can without creating an opening that does me harm.  No, it's not easy, not one little bit. I don't have a very good sense of balance at the best of times.  In situations like this, I have none.  It's hard.  I don't really understand why our relationships with some must be so difficult and painful and with others it's easy travel.  I don't understand it at all, but I know it is so.  That I do.The past few mornings I've been watching a deer graze on the front lawn.  There is nothing more peaceful than a deer when it feels perfectly safe.  This doe grazed like any cattle does and was out the same time each morning.  I'd grown rather used to looking out the window at her as she ate, her tail flicking gently.  As she walked across the yard, she was never in a hurry but just slowly walked across.  I was pretty sure she had a fawn somewhere near.  It's common that at least one doe raises a fawn here on our property. I missed the doe on Tuesday morning.  I missed her Wednesday, as well.  And then Maddie took off from her breakfast Wednesday and ran into the brush and barked and came back with a fawn's leg bone in her mouth.  The aroma told me the fawn had been dead for some time.  Maddie didn't kill it.  I suspect the coyote that treks across the place from one pasture to the other  had discovered the fawn and killed it and Maddie just stumbled on the remains.  I found myself weeping hard.  It seemed too much this physical ailment and the tangled webs I'd been fighting my way through and the spiritual seeking that had felt like beating at skies of bronze, to have the one peaceful thing I found shattered, as well.  It was as though the evil world had intruded on my last frontier of peace. I wanted to run away and hide until all my worries went away.  They never do go away though do they?    And it's not in my nature to hide anyway.  I tend to face my troubles head on, much as I'd rather not.  I can't protect myself in any way except to be strong.  Even when being strong is the hardest thing I know to do.  I have to face the hard things as well as the soft easy things.  There is no safe place that will go untouched by some form of disaster or pain.  I can only choose my best path, not the easiest one, but the best one.John has borne the brunt of my not feeling well and being snippy.  He's well aware of what a struggle this relationship is for me and has been.  I had to stop resenting him and recall that because I was damaged in other relationships before him,  in this relationship I have been nurtured and pushed to grow in equal measure.  His interest is not what makes his path easiest but what makes for a healthy happy relationship for the two of us.  He's learned the same as I that peace at any cost is never ever peace.  It's bondage.  Peace is standing firm assured that your best is not necessarily what another wants but what is right and true, even when it's hard.No happy sunny post this week.  No easy chat.  If the vague references frustrate you then I'm sorry.  I have never wanted to harm anyone with my blog posts and even though I'm assured that not one of the three mentioned here reads this blog or cares to, I'd rather not have them lose their privacy or anonymity.  Yet, I did want to share that difficult relationships require more of us than those which are easy.  I wanted to share because someone else out there is struggling hard as I have.  Perhaps you aren't aware that the troublesome relationship has been affecting your marriage or your relationships with others.  I wanted to share too because I find writing therapeutic.  On page, I can edit and worm out those other thoughts that get caught in the webs and confuse things still more."},

{"title": "More Shoe Box Meal Ideas", "date": null, "text": "As I worked in my pantry this week.  I arranged my few shoe box meals a fresh and added ingredients to one or two.  I've not really worked with this the way I'd planned.  For one thing I haven't purchased all the ingredients I need for the few I'd put together.  I'll do that shopping and set them up proper.Naturally as I worked I thought up new boxes and would like to share those ideas with you all, as well. I'd thought about breakfast boxes: dry individual boxes of cereal perhaps and envelopes of dry milk and a bit of canned fruit such as blueberries or plums in light syrup for one idea.  And why not a box with a packet of pancake mix and a can of spam?  Oatmeal packets and muffin mix in another, and perhaps biscuit mix in another box with Vienna sausages or something like that.   This is another idea I need to work out more fully and really I must make an appointment with myself to go to the stores and scout around as to what I might purchase.  I needn't purchase it all at once but to have an idea would allow me to build my list and purchase a bit along. Other ideas that came to me: Baked Beans and Brown Bread and Potato Salad.  Brown bread used to come in cans as did date roll.  I hope I can find that. Summer sausage with Canned Potato Salad and perhaps Beans.I used to have a rather nice recipe called Spoonbread Supper.  It began with chopped ham (canned will do obviously) and a box of cornbread mix with a bit of green onion (chives would do as well) that was baked and topped with diluted cream of mushroom soup.  It was quite good as a meal.  Here again, it's a matter of adding in sides such as peas and carrots and perhaps a fruit or gelatin or pudding as a dessert.Macaroni and cheese with a can of tuna and green peas to make a casserole.  A packet of bread crumbs or potato chips to top this dish would be nice.  Again, you'd want to work out your sides.I'd completely forgotten those microwaveable shelf stable meals.  I admit I've only ever had the one with roast beef and gravy and mashed potatoes.  It was okay.  I'd perhaps like to try another brand.  You can add green beans to this and it will do rather well.What about a jambalaya mix with a can of tomatoes and okra, canned chicken or shrimp, some minute rice, a bit of dried onion and peppers. I was just thinking of so many other canned entrée items I'd forgotten: beef stew or chicken and dumplings.  Those jars of Tamales used to taste very good.    You could do a Mexican dinner with a packet of Spanish or Yellow rice and a can of refried beans to go with the tamales.As you can see the ideas abound.  I'll be the first to confess I'm not overly fond of many of the canned pre-made entrees but they are all reliable and easy to make if you're ill or if someone unaccustomed to making meals must cook.  Because I'm not fond of them I wouldn't make the mistake of overstocking but a single can will do no harm on that score. I'd like to do a trial run at least once a week with the boxes I've set up, so I can work out kinks.  That would allow me to note which were successful and which were so so and which I'd just rather not do at all.  Making them will let me know quickly enough which are tolerable!  Have you come up with any new ideas for shoe box meals since the first post back in April?  Please share your ideas in the comments section."},
{"title": "Kitchen Organization on a Dime", "date": null, "text": "Olive oil tins as utensil holders.I am an organized person.  I love nothing better than to have a place for everything and everything in it's place.  For one thing, it helps me to remember where something is.  If a certain item is found in a certain spot every single time, I never have to go hunting for it.I would love nothing better than to spend all my time in one of those sorts of stores that has every organizational aide known to woman or man for closets and cupboards.  I don't want to pay big prices though for clever organization and since most of those stores are located in big cities, no desire to travel to find items, either.  So how do I stay organized?  It's a combination of using what I have and making the most of what I have on hand.  Here are some of my most recent organizational tools.  You might be surprised.First I am a saver of things: boxes, containers, jars, jugs, etc. In the top kitchen drawer I keep my baggies.  I store washed and dried cereal bags in a bread sack.  I fold them tight and press the excess air out of them.  I like to store meat in the cereal bags.  It's something I don't mind tossing in the trash after, I can tape them shut and mark directly on the bag what is in them.  I can put like cuts of meat together (say all breasts) and tuck those bags into a large zippered bag to keep them together.  Easy organization, a nice reuse of something that typically is thrown away once empty, and if needed I can even cut on bag into squares to put between pieces of meat or homemade unbaked piecrusts and prevent them sticking together.I also have a small mustard jar in use keeping my rubber bands all together. Cottage cheese and sour cream containers are nice for storing leftovers, but I tend to forget items I can't see, so I rely more heavily on glass jars and glass containers.  I'm slowly collecting those glass rectangular pieces with snap on plastic lids.  Love them!   I  pick up one or two at a time when I'm in Ross or Marshalls where they are cheapest.  I do save the lids off the sour cream and cottage cheese containers to put between homemade burgers.  Makes taking out one or two from the freezer a cinch and because I can pat the burger out to fit the lid, I have a controlled portion as well.  And individual ice cream cartons or yogurt lids make great slider burger portions as well as keeping them separated."},
{"title": "This Week In My Home:  Cramming in All We Can", "date": null, "text": "This week in my home......I am weary this evening, and so I'm late in posting.  I do apologize. Inspired thinking simply isn't happening today. We made another flying family visit, going down to south Georgia so we could be with Josh for his birthday party.  Officially his birthday is on Monday but it was far more practical and better attended on Saturday than it might have been on Monday.  I was surprised at the changes in my boys in just two weeks time, just as I was surprised at Taylor's fast forwarding last weekend.  Josh was adorable telling guests, \"Welcome to my home, guys!\" I didn't expect to have a lot of his time or attention with so many guests, some of whom were his size so he had important things to do.  I did get a few snuggles and hugs and kisses towards the end of our day there.   Tuesday Isaac will be 4 months old.  His eyes have cleared of that almost cloudy baby fuzz and are the clearest, most earnest blue you'd ever hope to see.  He had staring contests with everyone because he is a studier of people and there were plenty to study.  To Grampa he cooed and gurgled and the two napped together in the big recliner.  Then he happily snoozed on Gramma and took a break between naps to frown and stare at  Uncle Moose and then came right back to Gramma for a follow-up nap.  The big excitement of his day was getting his diaper changed at which point he kicked and gurgled and cooed and arched his back to let me know I could pick him up at any time.But I confess it's hard to make that trek and then back in the same day and despite a good night's sleep I feel weary.  That's our third weekend of travel in three weeks time.  I'm worn down. I'm afraid we've done all we can this month to cram in the family visits and we won't likely do this again together for some time."},
{"title": "Frugal Friday:  Savings Is Always Normal", "date": null, "text": "Saturday:  Off to visit Katie today.  I packed some chicken breasts and blueberry cobbler for dinner, had ice from the icemaker to keep things cold.  I also carried along a packed picnic supper for us. I encouraged John to stop for breakfast.  Yes, I did.  I paid out of my pocket money.Had a perfectly lovely day and that is priceless.  My little granddaughter is a delightful age, learning an amazing number of things daily.  There were lots of snuggles, and I loved that she had to 'cook' for me.  Perhaps we're raising another foodie who enjoys cooking and serving to loved ones as much as Katie and Sam and Amie and I enjoy it.  I love seeing it translate to the newer generation of our family.Left my sunglasses at Katie's.  We have this ironclad rule that it has to be mighty important to warrant turning around and going back.  Sunglasses do not rate a turn around.  Instead we stopped at a gas station at roadside.  I got some big Jackie O type sunglasses (the only style available) for $3.99.  Out of my pocket though John gave me money to buy.  I won't allow him to pay for a silly mistake on my part.  Funny thing is Katie left her sunglasses here last time she visited and I'd just returned them to her today.Katie sent home leftovers for a meal for us today.  John's portion went into his lunch.Got on the scale at Katie's.  We don't have one here at home.  I was aware that I'd gained weight but somehow seeing the actual number on the scale was just the wake up call I needed to refocus myself on my personal health.  I'll be changing up my eating habits and utilizing my measuring cups once more.It was so cool outdoors this morning, I was able to open windows.  The AC didn't kick on until about noon so the house got filled with all that nice fresh air.  It was lovely to sit by the window and listen to the birds going crazy with busyness.  It's rained a good bit this week and was cloudy but the birds were just reveling in the sunny morning.  I couldn't blame them at all.  It's what prompted me to rush outdoors as soon as I'd had breakfast and play about in the flower beds.  Would you like to mosey around the flower beds for a bit?  I've been working in them this week.  No, not around the front part yet, but here along the back.  I've shifted some pots about and moved some decorative items from one bed to another and then I filled two more planters with soil and lily bulbs with daffodil and muscari underneath.  I've been reading that layering planters is the way to extend the life in pots over a number of seasons.  One thing would be filling out while another is dying back.  I have day lily in one pot and Asiatic lilies in another.   They aren't showy just yet, but hopefully they'll get there before long.  I didn't take a picture of that end of the back bed since it would just look like five empty pots, lol.  But here's the little bed at the back porch this season:"},
{"title": "June is Peach Season", "date": null, "text": "In the late winter months when cold weather usually starts to pall, I remind myself that peach season needs those good cold hours to make the fruit.  Then sometime in late February (usually) the trees begin to bloom.  Often you can see acres and acres of trees blooming at once.  It's the loveliest thing!From there on we pray the cold weather is over and done and no harm comes to our peaches. I personally like freestone peaches which tend to come in a bit later, towards July.  However, this week we noted as we drove down to John's work place that peach harvest was in full swing.   These early peaches are known as 'cling' peaches because they cling to the stone.  These are generally what you find canned in stores.Tuesday at Aldi we noted the peaches were small.  I skipped buying them because there is just something different about the peaches sold in a grocery store and those sold in a packing shed.  You can't say I'm talking nonsense, but I assure there is. I generally buy my peaches while they are still firm but just picked from the trees.  Then I bring them home and let them slowly finish ripening.  Oh.my.goodness.I have two early memories of peaches.  One was of being at Grand mama C's home.  She always froze her fruits and vegetables in these tidy little white waxed boxes that you slipped a plastic bag inside and tied off with a twist tie.  The box kept the fruit flat.  I really must look for some of those little boxes because they do make for a very neat fit in the freezer!"},

I tried to think what date I'd choose to 'begin again'.  Food for thought, right?I guess I've had that time in my life already.  It was the date about two years ago when I found myself in the hospital.  I had come very close to dying twice during that time.  I looked long and hard at my life and determined that if I was being given a second and third chance then I was doggone well going to change some things!  And I did."},

All of a sudden a diaper change and kicking little legs brought Taylor's focus upon him.  She watched, she helped, she touched his hand and his feet and felt his head.  She was oh so gentle the whole while.  Then she offered to help put on his jeans and once the jeans were on Isaac was invisible to her once more."},

{"title": "Charm School:  Your Shining Glory", "date": null, "text": "When I was young, my straight hair bothered my mother no end.  She pin curled it, she put rollers in it.  She used Dippity Do, sugar water, beer and hair spray on it prior to pin curling or rollers.  Tender headed with fine straight hair it was torturous to me to have so much done to my hair.  My mother finally resorted to perms which left me with a head full of frizzy unruly hair that bushed about my head like an afro long before the look was popular in the early 1970's.I finally rebelled hard my 14th year when Mama asked Granny and Aunt Myrtle to trim and curl my hair.  They worked on opposite sides of my head, Granny to the left, Aunt Myrtle to the right and the end result was that one side was two inches longer than the other and both sides stood out from my head like Bozo's red wig.  I took one long look in the mirror and one long look at my mother's face.  It was obvious she saw what a huge mistake it was.  I said quietly, \"No more.  I have straight hair.  I will have straight hair.\"  Eventually the perm grew out and I allowed my hair to grow long like the rest of my classmates.  By the time I graduated I had hair that reached mid-back, was parted down the middle and fell in glossy folds.  And so my hair stayed until well after Samuel's birth when I chose to have the typical 1980's permed bob.  I must say the look suited me and this hairstyle was professionally done but after ten years I'd had enough of that as well.  From there I went through a new hairstyle about every six months.  It's only been in the past couple of years that I've found my current pixie cut which suits me.  I've not grown tired of it, I can easily style it and I am continually complimented upon it.  I know that for this time in my life, it's the right cut for me.Saturday:  We were up early this morning but not because we had heavy tasks to attend to.  All I needed to do was cook potatoes, steam green beans and keep food hot until everyone got here.  No problem.  I even had time to lounge about, do my morning Bible study, finish off my book and give myself a manicure.  Lovely Shabat morning.John made me a tumbler of unsweetened iced tea this morning.  I hadn't tried the Yeti tumblers though he's continued to rave over them.  Well now I know why.  He made my tea about 10:30.  At 6pm this evening there was still ice in the tumbler!  I'm sold!Three of my crowd (all in the same family) have an intense dislike for mayonnaise.  I wanted to make a potato salad.  I chose to use a recipe I recall Katie using years ago while she was at home and preparing meals once a week.  It is an Herbed Potato Salad.  I don't have the cookbook she used to use, but I did my best with what I had on hand: sour cream, dill, chives, parsley, salt, pepper and lemon juice mixed into hot potatoes.  It's different enough but not so far off one wouldn't recognize it is potato salad.  I found the mixture a little 'dry' for my tastes, but I wouldn't have wanted any more sour cream in it.  I think when I try this again I'll add in some mayonnaise just to increase the creaminess overall.  Still it made the mayo haters happy and nobody else minded the change in recipe in the least."},
{"title": "Charm School:  Good Looks Begin Within", "date": null, "text": "In reading any of the books upon my list, each begins with what we all know and have heard many times over.  However, in school we often begin with a review of what we already know before we move on to new knowledge.  So let's begin at the beginning and work our way from there, shall we?I am simultaneously using each of the books and websites I listed as I come upon subjects.  The information is then cross referenced from one to another and that's how I shall be submitting it to you, rather than doing an individual review of each item.  I think we'll have more the atmosphere of lessons in that manner and that is what I wished to do with this subject of learning to be charming and elegant.  By the way, if any of you have any recommendations for books that you personally own or websites you especially like, please bring them to my attention so that I might share them.  Sarah reminded me of  one such site that I'd shared with you all last year:  A Lady's Code is an excellent site with good information.Now let us begin today's lesson.Every one of my books recommends we begin with the image in our mirror.  I love how one author stated it because it is both humorous and too true: \"In your lowest moments, when you look in the mirror do you feel like a magazine advertisement for \"Before\"?\"   Gracious!  That did make me chuckle and wince both at the same time.  Yes, I can say honestly that many times I look in the mirror and feel like the 'Before' photo!   So where do we start?  At that mirror.  A full length mirror is likely best, but you'll also want a mirror that allows you to see your face and hair and other features close up.  I am blessed (?) with two full length mirrors above our big garden tub.  I add the question mark because you do see yourself clearly revealed in all your glory and shame when you have full length mirrors in the bathroom!  Stand before a mirror, clothed or not as you choose, and look at yourself as you would a stranger.  I mean it.  Wipe away all those pre-conceived (and too often wrong) assessments you've made of yourself in the past and look objectively at yourself.  How's your posture?  Do you slump or stand with shoulders curved forward or thrust unnaturally far back?   I know I often tend to slump a bit.  I can hear Granny tell me 1000 times more \"Stand up straight and don't round your shoulders!\"  She was quite right.  I often see young women who stand in such a way.  I'll lay odds that nine times out of ten it's lack of good confidence that causes them to slump as they do.  Why don't you bring a chair in so you can sit before the mirror for a moment?  That's a good way to get a good view of whether you are sitting with proper posture.  Here too I find I often slump.  This is partly due to the fact that I work with my laptop on my lap and I tend to lean forward over the laptop.  I really do need to get a tray or work table that will lift up the laptop to a better height...But I digress. How's your figure?  I mean really, how is your figure?  Most of us have bulges and bumps and few of us are at the perfect weight but  NO figure is completely without merit.  Do you have long slender legs?  A nice waistline?  A good bust? Do you have slender wrists and ankles?  Most of us are perfectly aware of the supposed faults of our body shape but have you looked about at others?   I've been a people watcher for years and if you are in a public place you'll soon note how many women have your same body type.  We'll address this further in a future lesson, but just be sure that you are no more unique in your shape any more than you are in your height or shoe size or coloration of hair/eyes and skin!I am fully aware of a few exercises that target my problem areas.  Aren't you?  I have some areas I need to address and while I can certainly lose weight, and who doesn't need to do so?, I am aware that diet alone won't correct lax muscles.  For now, just jot down on a piece of paper what you consider your best features and what you'd like to change and do be realistic, dear.  You can't grow the length of your legs physically but there are ways to look taller and just bear that in mind when you note corrections you'd like to make.  Is there a foundation garment you perhaps need?  It isn't the day of the girdle anymore thank heavens, but there are foundation garments that can help trim certain areas or lift others and smooth still others.  Now let's do a close up.  Use the smaller mirror and your own eyes to determine if your facial features are sharp and angular or rounded.  Is your nose long or pert?  What is the shape of your eyes and eye brows?  How is your mouth?  Look at your teeth.  Are they white?  I don't mean the sort of unnaturally white we see too often these days but are they white?  Is your skin clear and fresh looking or is it sallow and prone to breakouts?    How does the skin of your throat and ears look and the décolletage of chest?  Is the skin there coarse and loose?  Really look at yourself and don't just criticize.  Freely note those things that are quite nice.  Perhaps you  are pleased with the shape of your eyes or mouth or you have really nice teeth.  Perhaps you've tended well to your skin and it's fresh and nice looking.  May I share here what I found?   I find the shape of my mouth rather pleasing, my eyes just a tiny bit too close and droopy at the outer corners.  I've worked on my brows for years and the shape is rather pleasing but I  must add to the length of them when I do makeup.  My teeth are good but slightly crooked.  My nose is proportional to my face but I think it's a little large though it is straight.  Access the shape of your face.  No matter that you did this years ago and have always known your face shape.  Did you know our face changes shape as we grow and age?  I used to have an oval face but I'd noticed there had been a change.   One author suggested tying a ribbon about the face, going under the chin and up around the top of the head with hair pushed well back.  I think one of those stretchy sort of hairbands works just as well.  I have often suspicioned of late that my face was square and I was quite right.   I have delicate features (a small face).    Did you know that your face may be triangle, heart, square, oval, round, heart or diamond shaped?  I had no idea!  I'd always heard of round and square and oval but no clue the other shapes also existed.  That was a new lesson. Do you wear glasses?  Does the shape of your glasses suit your face?  I need to go check on that myself.  I do know my features are small enough that big round owl glasses do not suit me and simply overwhelm my face.  Aviators aren't for me either.  I'll definitely be looking at recommended styles for a small square face this afternoon!Now look at your hair?  Is your hair texture straight or curly, coarse or fine?  Dull?  Shiny? Dry? Oily?  Does the color look lustrous and natural or is it fade?  I'm finding I'm rather pleased with my hair now that I'm not dyeing it any longer.  The color is darker, far more black than I'd realized and the gray highlights  that natural dark color.  It's striking with the silver I have at my temples.  Do you like the style you currently wear?  I still love my pixie type cut but I'm currently looking for ways to style it so that I'm not forever wearing my hair in just one way.  I checked sites online to see if a pixie cut  suited a square face.  Yes, it does.  I'd instinctively chosen Anne Hathaway as my personal model for hair last night and today I discovered that she has a square face.  That was a bit of instinctive guessing that boosted my confidence in my own assessment of self.  One site suggested slightly spiking my hair.  That is the way my former stylist did it and it was fun to wear that way.  I noted a few of Anne Hathaway's mix-ups with her hair, some of which I liked far better than I did others.  I'm trusting my instincts on this one and feel sure I can carry off those variations of hers I chose to save to my file.In order to determine if your hair cut and style suits your face, put into the search box of your favorite search engine the shape of your face and the style of your hair such as page boy or upsweep, etc.  Add any additional information about length of your hair such as whether it's long or short or medium.  View several of the resulting search sites.  Some are infinitely more helpful than others and some are fairly useless.Now I shall discuss proper hair care next post but let us continue with this lesson at present.How does your skin look?  Is it smooth and clear?  Are you prone to breakouts?  Do you see large pores?  Do you have fine wrinkles?  Do you have a skin care routine?  Is it the same routine you've used since you were a teen? It might well be time to do something fresh.  I noted after years of using the same products that my skin looked dull and uneven.  I had to find new products to use.  How do your nails look? Check both hands and feet.   Are they smooth and well shaped?  Do you have rough dry cuticles?  Do you have calluses?  We'll talk about proper hand and foot care later on, too, but for now note any problems you see or anything you find especially pleasing.We're all done with the mirror now. You can dress and put away your chair and let us look internally at ourselves.How is your health?  Your physical health is a good indicator of how well your nails, skin, hair, teeth and eyes will look.  It's what is going on inside our bodies that determines what happens on the surface outside as well as affecting your emotional and mental health.  Are you plagued with indigestion?  Pain?  Are you anxious or nervous?  There is almost always something we can do to ease those symptoms besides mere medication.  I am not discounting medicines by the way, but I do believe that if addressed organically with diet and exercise and rest, a real difference can be had.Let's talk about sleep....Do you get enough?  Sleep is one of those things we all need for good health.As teens we were forever hearing about the needed eight hours.  That's only just barely right for a teen, did you know that? Children and teens might well require up to twelve hours sleep daily in order to function rightly and be really healthy because they are growing so rapidly.  The minimum required is eight hours.  As we grow older our need for sleep lessens somewhat.  That is because we are no longer actively growing.  However, that is not to say we have no need of rest.  Sleep is essential to cell renewal, to recharging the brain and to slowing down organs so they can self heal and repair in order to function properly.  At the very least we should have six hours of rest nightly.  Even if you do not sleep fully that entire time, to lie quietly in bed, with mind as blank as you can make it and eyes closed, can be refreshing.  It's not as beneficial as sleep but it's helpful.  Do you keep regular sleep hours?  I'm not asking if you're a morning person or a night person.  I'm asking do you routinely retire at a certain hour each night and arise about the same time most days?  Do you follow a night time ritual to trigger the part of your brain that brings on sleep?  Oh this too shall be another short lesson so we'll move on for now but keep this in mind and make any notes you need to have as a reminder.How's your diet?  Do you 'eat the rainbow' in fruits and vegetables?  Do you eat adequate amounts of proteins and fats and fiber rich foods?  Do you eat a good variety of seasonal fruits and vegetables?  Is your diet balanced or do you lean hard on snack foods?  Diet will be a addressed more fully a little later on but suffice it to say now that you truly are what you eat, especially on the outside.   Are you drinking enough water?  Too much coffee or soda?  All of these things work together for or against you.  Keep that in mind!This next is a rather delicate subject, but I must address it because it is part of good health....It's about your bodily functions of elimination.  Do you drink enough water?  Do you go to the bathroom at regular times?  Do you have problems that should be addressed in this area?  Elimination is very important.  I know  present studies say there is absolutely no toxin in body waste but I don't believe it for one minute.  I know how I feel physically if my body is not functioning normally and I know how I feel when all is as it ought to be.  Chronic problems can prevent the absorption of nutrients and vitamin retention if you go too frequently or cause you to feel quite ill and show up as acne and poor skin quality if you don't go frequently enough.  I will address this only a few moments more and then we're done with it, but I was much amused by one of the books suggestion that we determine what our 'time of day' would be and stick to it.  Frankly, I'd never assumed I had that sort of control over my body but now I do wonder.  We're taught as children to control the movement of bowels and the urgency to eliminate and perhaps as adults we should be practicing the control to move them at will?  It's something to think on for sure.If you do have chronic issues there are all sorts of remedies to be tried that do work.  A doctor's advice is not remiss if you have really chronic issues.  Diet will help remedy issues for most but if that fails and other natural remedies do you no good, do see your doctor and take his advice on the matter.Do you get enough air and sunshine?    Do you spend at least ten minutes daily in the sun absorbing all that good Vitamin D3?  Did you know that many of today's current ailments stem from the LACK of D3?  We were made by our Creator to absorb it from the sunshine and with all the hoopla about using sun screen and processed foods we eat, the loss of basic nutrients in foods that are stored for long term as well as the loss of nutrients in soil no one gets nearly enough D3 anymore.  It's vital!  A lack of D3 can be traced to heart defects, loss of thyroid function and even has been shown in some studies to contribute to Diabetes!  Ten minutes at least once a day is all that is required.  Choose a portion of the day when the sun's rays are not so direct and soak up that good sunshine!Does anyone sleep with a window open anymore?  I think in this day and age we're all a bit afraid to do so.  I'd love to sleep with a window cracked near my bed but John absolutely puts his foot down about that.  He was burgled three times before he moved from his old home state and he practices extreme caution about open windows.  Well, it's not just night air that refreshes.  Daytime air is just as good.  A few minutes outdoors daily getting a few rays of sun is just as good a time to breath in deeply of outdoor air.  Airing the house daily for a few minutes cannot hurt either.  If you're out driving, roll the windows down just a little and get some air then.What about exercise?  It doesn't have to be strenuous but daily exercise is beneficial.  It helps you to breathe more deeply, it pushes the body to perspire which can flush out toxins and it causes endorphins to rise which can elevate your mood.  Many recommend gentle stretches at night before bed to relax the body.  Just as many suggest that stretches in the morning can encourage blood flow to joints and organs.  Do you like to walk?  Then walk.  If you prefer a more regimented program then make up your own routine, one that targets those areas you hope to correct in your figure.  I personally find the Pilates core movements are easy enough for someone of even limited ability.  I plan to incorporate them once more into my daily routine.  It just so happens those core movements hit all the spots that trouble me most about my figure and will help correct my posture flaws!Now let us discuss hygiene.  I guess in the day and age in which I grew up indoor plumbing was common place rather than the exception.  I am fully aware that running water and indoor baths are still relatively new to many homes even here in the United States.  I mean that we've really not had them in every home for a  100 years yet!  That said, I always wondered at the need to even mention the need to bathe and shampoo routinely, but then I met a woman who was not aware of basic hygiene principles. She had a home and a decent enough one at that.  She simply didn't bathe routinely because she was never taught to do so.  It was not uncommon to note a bead of dirt about her neck or to note that her hair needed washing.   I could never quite shake that image from my mind after visiting with her on more than one occasion.   We should all bathe on a daily basis.  I do realize for some of the young mothers that is a dream with toddler and under aged children but we should all bathe daily.  Soap and warm water do more good than you'd imagine.  Did you know that perspiration releases certain toxins that remain upon the skin?  Body odor is normal but it certainly shouldn't be evident to those about you.  Bathing refreshes the skin, as it also removes dead skin cells.   Granny was my lesson on water conservation.  When the well was in danger or running dry and filling the tub wasn't possible she bathed using a basin of water.  I myself employed a basin of water nightly when I was unable to shower for two months at physical rehab hospital due to my injuries.  There really is no excuse for going without a bath!Summary:  Standing before a mirror critique and be kind to yourself as well as truthful about what is wrong with your figure, your hair, skin, posture.Determine the shape of your face.  Look at websites to determine if you're making the most of your facial shape with the correct hairstyle and the shape of your glasses.Diet, fresh air, sunshine and exercise as well as rest affects both your internal health and external appearance of health.   Determine how well you meet these daily needs.A daily bath is necessary for good hygiene and good physical health."},

{"title": "A Medieval Home Companion", "date": null, "text": "Amie gave me this book when she was in high school because she was sure it was something I'd love to read.  I am positive she read it herself before passing it on to me because that was usually what she did, read and then give to me with the recommendation that I read it as well.This little book is quaint in some ways and quite wise in many others.  For the month of May, I decided to start my charm school with the chapter on Worship, Dress, Deportment and Speech and within a few pages I found wise advice.For a little background, the manuscript the book is based upon is a sort of lengthy letter written in book form by an elder man to his very young bride.  It is believed he was in his 50's or 60's and she but 15.  I am touched at the beginning by his introduction in which she asked him in their bedchamber to never criticize her before the servants or friends but to wait until they were alone each evening and then to instruct her how she might better conduct herself.I had a nice response from you all about the ShoeBox Meals.  I wanted to share the information that readers chipped in with:Lana noted that Southern Plate has a similar thing that she's shared on her blog.  Shelf stable meals that she stores in a zippered storage bag and calls Bags to Dishes.  Follow the link to see her ideas.  I've just glanced at the site but have it bookmarked to go back to.  I read one recipe and she mentioned that there were now nearly a month's worth of meals online.  The link I'm giving you is linked directly to these specific set of recipes.She also suggested this menu:    I would add the taco soup recipe that is made up of 5 cans of food and a cornbread mix.  I immediately thought of Pioneer Woman's Seven Can Soup as another good possibility.Judy shared this suggestion for a shoe box meal:  I would maybe add--Chicken/Dorito casserole..[ Using can chicken breast, cream of chicken soup, dorito chips, Can of cheese whiz. Dried pepper/onion flakes. Green beans, Pineapple slices.Michele offered this suggestion.  I went to find the recipe and yes indeed it is a great idea for a shoe box meal.  Even better it's pretty much a one dish meal:  Just a quick thought about tuna salad. We like ours a little on the dry side so we use mustard instead of mayo. Also, there is a delicious recipe for chicken barley chili on the back of the Quaker Quick Barley package. I make it with all canned goods. I usually make it in the slow cooker, but it is fast and easy on the stove top as well."},

{"title": "More on 'Salad Days'", "date": null, "text": "I thought of several things after my post yesterday and then you readers chipped in with some hints that are too good not to share.  So here goes with my thoughts and then your additions.I generally wash only one head of lettuce at a time unless of course, I'm serving many. For just John and I the standard head will do us for about three or four salads each.  I wait until I'm ready to serve salad for the first time and then I wash the head of lettuce.  I cut off the root end (and if I'm being smart I set it right away in a dish of water or pop into soil).  Then I wash well and set to drain on my drying mat.  While the lettuce is still damp, I cut what is required for our salad.  If I've planned to have salad the next day I'll go on and double up on what I cut up.  I wrap the remaining lettuce in a clean cotton cloth which I keep just for this purpose.  I like old solid cotton napkins and flour sack towels for this purpose.  Then I pop the damp bundle into a zippered baggie and close it and place in my vegetable bin.  Lettuce will keep up to a week this  way, though I admit we seldom have any last that long.I've found if I'm planning to have salad the next day I'd better not put it on the table.  John will absolutely eat every bit of it!  I generally make a large enough salad that I get about 2 cups and he gets about 3cups.  Lettuce is one thing that is a 'free' food for most diets, meaning you can eat up to 4 cups of it without noticeably impacting your carb count."},
{"title": "More on Homemaking", "date": null, "text": "Tammy shared her routine with us and I thought you'd like to see that comment.Monday - kitchen day - clean out the refrigerator, quick inventory of the pantry, prep food for the week including baking, then cleaning of counters, floors, and straightening cupboards and drawers as needed.Tuesday - deep cleaning day - weekly rotation of concentrating on \"zones\" which include living/dining, bedrooms, bathrooms, porches/garage/car.Wednesday - laundry day - we do laundry daily, but this is the catch-up day. I do our sheets, rugs, any odds and ends in the laundry room. I also take this day to clean the laundry room and check inventory of supplies.I've been reading a lot about the food services that now box up produce, meat and fruit for a home and sell it at an average of $20/meal for 3 meals.  Not saying it isn't a great idea, especially if you happen to be in a big city with limited access to shopping and must walk or transport food without a car.  I'm pretty sure under those circumstances I'd be utilizing the same services myself! I can't help, however, recall that in one of my vintage women's magazines a woman made a suggestion for 'shoe box meals' and these services remind me of that and have made my brain wheels turn.Now this woman happened to be paid once a month.  In those months in which there was a fifth week she struggled to make her grocery budget stretch.  So she settled down with the calendar, noted when the fifth weeks occurred (twice a year usually in May and November) and then she made out a menu list of meals that she could make from canned foods and basic pantry items only.  She purchased a few extra items during the four week months.  She set up seven shoe boxes with a menu card on the front and into each box she put the components for those meals.   Personally I thought it was a great way to insure a few convenience meals were on hand."},
{"title": "Salad Days", "date": null, "text": "Angela asked me last week to share salad topping ideas.  Well that made me think of all the wonderful things you can do with a bowl of lettuce.  I mean it's basically a blank canvas!First let's look at the types of lettuce.  I personally like a hearty leaf lettuce.  Romaine is one such, leaf lettuces both red and green, Boston (or Bibb), frisee...I suggest you try any leafy type lettuce at least once.  Romaine is the least expensive and the most easily found.  Often you can find a pack of three 'hearts of Romaine, which is the inner parts of Romaine for about $3.  A proper loose purchased head of Romaine has a lot of coarse dark green outer leaves.  When I mention they are coarse, I do not mean they are tough but they have a sturdiness that is not at all like iceberg lettuce, which is pretty flavorless compared to the leaf lettuces.  Then there are the bitter lettuces, like arugula and endive.  They can be a bit pricey but to add to a bowl of green leafy lettuces the price is somewhat absorbed.  Personally, I'm not terribly fond of bitter lettuces.So experiment and try different lettuces.  If you end up going back to Iceberg because you like it best, then you've at least tried something new.  Iceberg does have it's merits.  Usually it's quite inexpensive and it's almost always a nice crisp lettuce.  It has less chlorophyll and more water content and essentially is flavorless.  It does well as a finely shredded lettuce (cut very thin with a sharp knife) or torn by hand."},

Since most are probably familiar, I'll be brief.I've thoroughly enjoyed reading Good Housekeeping's Book On The Business of Housekeeping, A Manual of Method  by Mildred Maddocks Bentley, published in 1924.There's all kinds of advice in the book.  If ever you wondered why so much work in the long ago days this book pretty much covers it.  Divided into five sections, the fifth is on laundry and is the longest and the most detailed.  Every aspect of doing the washing is covered from making soap solutions and the equipment required to detailed instructions of exactly how full a load of laundry should be. While there were many labor saving devices back then such as an automatic washer and a wringer as well as ironers that could do many pieces of ironing in a day's time, it was fully expected laundry would take two full days work. The first day was solely compromised of washing, mending, treating stains, starching and drying. The second day was relegated to ironing. The more fortunate woman had a maid who attended to the laundry.  Otherwise the whole of the household work was shoved into a mere four days a week while laundry took up the first two."},

In my scenario, I'm taking a chicken, a bunch of celery, a bag of carrots and a bag of onions and I'm going to show how those same ingredients can be used in a variety of ways to make different meals.  Now this is far more economical than you might think, because while I'm not limiting anyone to just one chicken or one bunch of celery, etc., several of the meals can be made from just that one chicken.  Pot Roasted Chicken may not be something you commonly think of but I've made this on more than one occasion.  You can do this in the crockpot or slow roast in the oven. I leave the chicken whole and then chop some carrots, onions and celery and place them around the chicken. I have often added potato chunks and apple chunks to the pan and it's really delicious!"},

Oh horrors!  Those have to be the most awful words ever spoken in any  relationship.  (John) and I promised we'd never use them during a fight  and to this day we've both honored that vow.  But I have used them  during this marriage.  I used those awful words one day when working on  my budget during my ever increasing battle with personal finances.You see,  I'd never really learned to handle money.  Money was the source  of a great deal of worry, pain and fear. Would there be enough to cover  bills?  If bills were paid would it stretch to cover groceries?   Clothing needs?  Would unexpected expenses arise?  Would I make a fatal  error in the totting up of the checkbook?  Would I be forever robbing  Peter to pay Paul?I want to share with you how I came to the  point of screaming \"I want a divorce!\" at money.  One of my first  memories in life: men coming into our home to carry out our belongings,  my bedroom furniture included.  My parents went through a bankruptcy in  the early years of their marriage.  I was four.  My parents had a  nice home, a new car, a house full of new furniture, three children  and two jobs.  And they lost all but the three children and one of the  jobs when the bankruptcy occurred.  In the early 1960's, a  bankruptcy was taken very seriously.  It was a reflection of your  character.  An employer put a lot of stock in character back then and  bankruptcy was grounds for dismissal especially in certain fields.  My dad happened to work in one of those financial fields."},

Use what you have.  Do what you can.\"  I'll gather my inspiration where I can and this quote Mariana shared does it for me!Food stayed simple today.  While I was tempted to take something else from the freezer there was plenty of that chicken in the fridge. I reheated the legs and wings and cooked green beans and potatoes.  We had a slice of cake to follow.  It was good.  It filled us up.Noted that butter is awfully low in my food stock just now.  Well it ought to be.  I haven't purchased any in two months!  Fortunately I don't have a long list (it IS short paycheck week) for this pay period so I can stock up a little.   I wonder if we'll see any Easter baking sales this year?  It used to be that there were plenty near Easter (in April this year) but in the past few years all I see on sale are candies, cake mixes and pricey toys meant for bloated baskets from the Easter Bunny.  I'm not interested in giving children a second big gift giving experience to rival Christmas, but I would appreciate sales on butter and sugar and such.  In the meantime, I have started a 'need right now' grocery list and a 'watch for good sales' list.We had to switch on the AC this evening only briefly.  So briefly it ran one cycle, but it was enough to push aside the heavy, too warm air in the house.  Air too full of pollen (it looks dusty outdoors!) to consider opening windows.Made John's lunch items for tomorrow while I prepped supper sandwiches this evening.  I used another portion of that chicken (gracious, I'm ready to cluck!) to make sandwiches tonight.  As I restocked my pill boxes, I noted that I need to stock up once more on vitamins and supplements.  I'm going to do a thorough inventory of my stored stuff before I even think of  making any purchases though. Last time I didn't and ended up with still more of the very supplements which I  had in  good supply.  Knowing we had the time change tonight, I went ahead and set all the clocks ahead by one hour.  This insures the coffee pot timer goes off at the right time in the morning, and that we aren't late rising for John's need to go to work."},

Not that I buy packets of stuff or jars of pre-made gravy to use, but it's not uncommon for me to use a bouillon cube or base for gravy instead of pan drippings, which is a whole other thing than you can make with broth, too.  Honestly, the quality of gravy made with real meat drippings was such that I was reminded of my discovery one long ago day that while instant potatoes are good for those days when there are no potatoes or very limited meal preparation time, real potatoes mashed and served with butter beat the pants off instant.  Ditto for gravy made from scratch in the proper way with pan drippings.    The baked apples for this meal made it a very filling meal altogether.  Truth told, we really could have managed to feed one more today with an extra apple thrown in, without feeling we were going lacking.  It was a proper Sunday dinner sort of meal even if today is Monday."},

One thing I am surely learning as I go about these challenges.  It takes time.  It makes work.  It's not quick.  At 10:30 I finally sat down with the cookbook and scanned the recipe for egg noodles.  3 egg yolks and 1 whole egg!  Wow.  I hadn't counted on that.  Note to self, look at recipes next time when planning meals.  But, being the substitute cook I am, I decided I could sub in 2 eggs and forget the whole business of using up four eggs (with whites leftover).  I also determined if I was going to use 2 eggs, I'd best make half a recipe, so I cut the flour in half.  Now I have half the noodles and fewer eggs than I'd planned as my leftovers.  Now, at this moment, I realize that I likely could have made the whole recipe since I was using the two whole eggs.  Another fail on my part."},

Now that said I thought this particular site was the most helpful, mainly because it provided the information in distinct categories.  This site suggested you should start with a BASE for building protein.  Base foods are:Category 1:  Breads, Cereals, and GrainsYou should choose whole grain products.  Rye, wheat, oat, rice, spelt, quinoa, Long Grain Brown Rice, Whole wheat products and Whole grain cereals.    These include; breakfast cereal, pasta, noodles, flour products, etc.Any item from Category 1 should be combined with any item from any of the next three food groups below.  Often recipes combine several from each category but it's helpful to know that the base will work with just one other food, isn't it?"},

{"title": "Dressed Like A Lady:  It's Not Just Clothes", "date": null, "text": "Parts of this post are a repeat post from July 2015.  I thought it appropriate to our theme this week of 'Dressed Like A Lady'.  I do not currently use all the brand specific products shown within the original post.  Often it is about the TYPE of product used rather than the brand used, so please note that.  I've also added more  information to the material to round out the post for our purposes here this week.While this is hardly a fashion blog and not likely to turn into one, it has certainly been my focus of late about how to look my best on a budget.  That being said, it's understandable that as I put on my makeup today I couldn't help but note some basic items that I consider my 'go to' items.  I do have other make up items but they don't stay in my cosmetic bag.  They move in or out depending upon my mood/season/desire for change.  My basics stay pretty much the same.  I thought you might be interested to know what I use and why/how.I start with a concealer stick.  I prefer one that  is in crayon form.   I have some sun damage to my skin from years of time spent in the sun without sunhats or sunscreen.  While the damage is not horrid, there are some dark spots I like to tone in a bit.  I also have dark outer corners on my eyes which make my eyes appear droopy.  I put this on first before I use foundation."},

{"title": "Dressed Like A Lady - A Challenge for Us This Week", "date": null, "text": "I watched a marathon of several episodes of the six seasons of Downton Abby at the end of December.  I love much about this series: witty repartee, outstanding actors and actresses, beautiful English countryside, gorgeous costuming, and a real live look at history as it was.  One of the things I noted in several of the last episodes I watched related to the dress of the Ladies of the manor.  I thought,\"I could be well dressed, too, if I had a lady's maid!\"  Well I can be well dressed without a lady's maid if I just pay attention to the things I noticed while watching the program.They planned ahead what they would wear the next day.  When the Dowager lady Grantham discovered she'd be having a caller the next day she told her lady's maid Danke that she'd wear something else instead of the dress chosen.  I was less concerned with what was said  after that because I was too busy going \"Huh! She'd planned her wardrobe already!\"  A couple of years ago I was desperate to make my wardrobe 'do' for another season when I found myself in tight finances.  One way I insured I didn't wear the same thing over and over again was to take some time to set up an outfit complete with accessories.   I still do this. I base these outfits upon known weather, plans, etc. I always  have one or two outfits for the unexpected things that might come up.  I set up both dressy and casual outfits so I'm always prepared.  The bonus for doing this: I save plenty of time in getting dressed instead of standing there pulling on a dozen things and discarding them.  I also save money.  I found that I wore more of my wardrobe more often and if I find something is seldom used, I soon remove it and place in a giveaway/donation bag."},

{"title": "In My Home This Week:  I Got Sunshine!", "date": null, "text": "In my home this week......I thought I'd do something a little bit different and just share a few random thoughts.  Okay?...I am watching as my calendar begins to fill up for the last of the month.  I am always amused by these times when the calendar fills and how the days all seem to fall together.  And then I'll go for weeks without any sort of an engagement or appointment at all.  ... I read an interesting passage in my Bible, in Leviticus this past week. It spoke of the Sabbath of rest for farmland.  I know that we often see fields here in the South uncultivated for a year or so after cotton is grown on it but I don't know any farmer that adheres to the Sabbath rest for the farmland.  I would be interested to see how the Sabbath rest would work for a field, because the promise is that if you do this, the sixth year of harvest will be so large and so abundant you will have enough food until harvest time in the eighth year...with foods leftover to toss away!  Now that is abundance!  Wouldn't that be awesome?...My celery, romaine and cabbage are all doing very well in the pot of soil. I am sure the warm air and sunshine in the mornings is doing them a world of good.  I have three more romaine root ends I hope to set in a pot this next week.  And in Georgia, it's time to plant green peas.  Peas don't seem to mind frost or cold here.  Parsley would do well this time of year, as well, and lettuce but it does need to be protected from frosts.  I have lettuce seed somewhere...Gracious I need to get busy and start planting so I don't miss out on good homegrown foods!"},

{"title": "Coffee Chat:  ALL the Possibilities!", "date": null, "text": "I am very much a New Year's glass FULL sort of woman and every thing, absolutely every thing is possible.  My Katie, whom I love for her quiet wisdom, tends to be more realistic.  She is prone to remind everyone who spouts off their resolutions that they will be the same person on New Year's day that they are on New Year's Eve.  She's got her point.  We aren't changing a thing if we're so caught up in talking or writing or daydreaming about changes that we aren't doing them.  I've learned to prefer action over day dreams.  I've seen my youngest daughter's wisdom in her too too truthful statement.  It was action that pushed us last year to get so much accomplished to improve our home.  The decluttering, organizing, refurbishing, sacrificing wants for carpeting and tile and shed, putting in the labor to slowly put in a few feet of mulched flower bed each month, etc. were all positive changes.  I looked about my home on New Year's day this year and said to John, \"I LIKE our house now...\"  I didn't hate it before, but this past year I learned to move beyond just being grateful for it, and appreciating it, to really LIKING it.  What's more the house itself seems to recognize this fact, though you may think I'm silly for saying so.  There is an atmosphere and energy connected with homes and ours most certainly has responded to the care we put into it this past year and has become a peaceful, positive, upbeat place. What helped us along this past year, I believe, was my adherence to the sound advice on a scrap of paper torn from a magazine at an unknown point which came to earth one morning as I moved a stack of papers.  \"Start where you are, use what you have, do what you can.\"  It was a motivator for me all year long.  Every time I got discouraged or wanted to quit, thought I couldn't do something because I hadn't any money, I'd say those words over to myself and get busy.  More got done last year than I believed possible.  And so this year, I've looked and looked for an inspiration phrase to motivate me as that one did last year. I have, at this point, most assuredly 'started'.   It's continuing this journey that interests me most."},
{"title": "January Challenge II: Organize the Kitchen", "date": null, "text": "It hits me every single January: the desire to clean hard, declutter, and organize.  This year it's not nearly as big a task as in the past, thanks to the fruit basket turnover of the whole house late last year.  BUT, there's always room for improvement.  I stumbled upon this calendar for decluttering on Pinterest. I am fortunate that I don't need to do a lot of work anyway, but  I love that this is broken down into daily tasks, so the job of organizing is never overwhelming. Yes, I know that I've started a week late on posting this but some days the 'task' is to read about her recommendations and suggestions on organizing and storage.  That's not hard duty and you can quickly catch up to date just by following the suggestions.And this does tie in with the USE IT UP challenge.  I definitely found some things to USE and some that I need to use up!Because I am ahead of the game, I was able to sort out my spices today, as well as the dish cupboard, under the sink, and one bank of cabinets where we keep things like snacks, cooking oils and such, and tea/pastas.  Honestly, I did most of this during commercials while I watched The Kitchen on Food channel."},

{"title": "Eating on a Tight Budget: Mother Hubbard's Cupboard, Final Post", "date": null, "text": "This will be the final post in the first part of this series.  I was pleased so many of you interacted and commented about this series.  I thank you all for participating.  Just as a reminder: My challenge this week was to stretch $20 as far as I could to provide meals for TWO. In my scenario, I had no pantry and no freezer to pull foods from and I was in the current season with nothing growing nor able to forage for any foods.  In a perfect world, a neighbor or family member might well have helped out.  Heaven knows Mama was the food angel for our household many times, bringing in a bag of fruit or a grocery sack filled with meat she'd bought on sale to help carry us along.  But in this scenario, it was John and I and $20.I took note of several things this week:1. Were it  necessary, I COULD provide for us on $20.  The meals wouldn't be well balanced and nutritionally sound, but they would sustain us and feed us three meals a day.  2. Second, I recalled why I like some of the recipes used during this challenge.  While I didn't go without proper seasonings, I do recall days when I didn't have the additions I made to the main dishes and that they filled us up.  They still do.  They are good, solid meals.3. I want to explore a bit further into this realm of eating cheaply and build up a repertoire of recipes to turn to.  I am going to be looking for inexpensive ingredients that will add nutritive value, fiber and protein to replace meat.  I noted today as I made a big pot of vegetable soup that the barley I used has a protein value.  It's low but it does have protein value.  So this is an area to research.4. Funnily enough, this scenario and my attempts to  get by on such a low amount, opened my eyes to the numerous spices and herbs I use only occasionally and made me aware of which I use often and often.  It also opened my eyes to how much food we have in this house!  It also made me aware of the many ways I might well stretch out the money I spent this week.  For instance, Debbie's comment about re-growing the green onions made me remember that I could attempt to regrow the celery as well.   That reminder prompted me to set romaine stems, celery root and cabbage end all in water.  Even if only a mere handful of leaves results from those attempts it would essentially be a handful more that I didn't have to pay for.  I plan to pot these items in soil, but not this evening.  It's quite cold and rainy outdoors.  It can wait through the weekend."},
{"title": "Frugal Friday: Use It Up...", "date": null, "text": "Saturday:  John worked last night.  I wanted to make him a big breakfast due to that, rather than our usual light Saturday morning fare.  I had half a steak left from Christmas Day dinner and made hash browns, fried eggs and toast.  He seemed to really enjoy it and said he'd just skip dinner or at least wait until later to eat.I took a frozen entrée of Turkey and Dressing with gravy from the freezer intending to have that for today's dinner.  Then Mama called saying she'd like to stop by here around noon.  She then texted to say she was bringing pizza.  I made a salad using the last of the tomatoes and lettuce and took that half carrot cake from the freezer to thaw.  It made a pretty good impromptu dinner and yes, John did eat, lol.  We just had a very light supper for tonight and did eat it a bit later than usual.There were two slices of pizza left.  That will be part of our supper one night in the early part of this week.Mama took home the rest of the carrot cake with her.  I was glad to send it with her.Sunday:  We had eggs and toast for breakfast.  I did this because John planned to go one of the DIY stores following church and this meal holds me longer than bagels and cream cheese will.John decided after church he'd rather run by Publix and then go home.  I took advantage of this decision to purchase bread for the week ahead and buy the few items I know I cannot get at Aldi: waxed paper, tabasco sauce, Worcestershire sauce.  John wanted microwaveable soup for his work lunch now that it's cold.  I walked up the soup aisle with him (he has carte blanch for choices like this as it is his work lunch).  I priced the bouillon pastes, which I prefer over bouillon cubes.  The first item I found was $6.99 a tub (about 1 cup total).  I was a bit put off by the price so I walked further up to price the bouillon cubes.  They too were $6.99 a bottle and not oversized containers of it either.  I glanced a little further down the aisle and noticed the Hispanic section of soup and bouillon items.  Just before that started I found  Publix store brand bouillon pastes for $4.99 a jar.  I bought beef, chicken and vegetable.  Those three items went onto my pantry shelf for now.John decided he needed to purchase water to take to work.  We have such good water here but the water at his workplace is city water and just tastes off.  He was going to buy a couple of 1 liter bottles which are much less expensive than standard soda sized bottles.  Then he spied a real bargain of 3L bottles of water for $1 each.  He got one for himself.  I suggested we get four more and put those on the pantry shelf as well.  I invested $20 in my pantry yesterday (with an extra box of waxed paper) and was glad to be busy stocking it with things we most certainly can use for real emergencies.After we returned home, I put some sweet potatoes into the microwave and reheated the turkey dressing we were going to have for yesterday's dinner.  It was very good.  I was reminded that I really should return to prepping a crock pot meal to cook while we were gone to church now the weather is cooler."},

{"title": "A Budget Balanced Meal", "date": null, "text": "I've longed to make a certain recipe for a bit over a year now.  Last week I finally did.  It  came about as the result of a leftover makeover.  I thought about each ingredient as I put the recipe together: Broccoli.  I was using stems and a few florets that I steamed together.  I have been guilty many times of not using the stems as I've planned to do but this time, I did use forethought and steamed them while steaming the florets for a meal.  I had a few florets left and chopped the stems up with them.  There was the broccoli called for in the recipe and it was using up every bit of that food.  Not bad thus far. Croutons were the next ingredient.  I make these using leftover slices of bread, those too small to make toast or a sandwich and the end pieces.  I generally put the cubed bread in the oven when I have it on to bake something else.  I remove the item that was cooking, set the pan of bread cubes in the oven and turn off the heat.  Generally within an hour or so I have a pan of croutons.  So this ingredient too was inexpensive.I knew the recipe called for two different salad dressings:  Blue Cheese and Ranch.  I'd just made up a half recipe of  Ranch dressing over the weekend.  John prefers Blue Cheese or French.  The Ranch dressing wasn't  likely to be finished before spoiling.  No hardship to use it up to avoid waste.  The Blue Cheese dressing is more pricey.  I was cautious about using that ingredient.In fact, from here the recipe and my made up version were widely variant.  I did not want to use half a jar of that dressing in my recipe!  That would have increased the cost by $2.  The recipe also called for 6 eggs...Nope wasn't going to do that either.  That was another $.50 in cost.  8 ounces of shredded cheddar...Uhm nooooo...Cost $1.79.  This simple little recipe meant to use up a variety of things leftover was now escalating into the $4 range, a per serving cost of about $1 each serving.  No, I just failed to see the economy in that!Now I've shared that I seldom know the cost per meal I serve or even the cost per serving of any recipe, but common sense helped me this time.  Had this been a main course, $1 per serving is not too far a reach, but it was meant to be a side dish.  I decided at this point expertise was going to have to come into play over recipe.  Eggs are generally meant for binding in a strata type recipe.  I knew from past experience at altering these types of recipes that 6 eggs are just not necessary.  I decreased the Blue Cheese Dressing by half and used milk in place of it.  A thinner liquid by all means but it worked just fine and I did have the egg for thickening the liquid.  I added 1 beaten egg, and half the cheese called for.  In the end, my Broccoli Strata total cost came in somewhere closer to  $1.80 for four servings.  Still a little high but far better than $1 per serving.  And this was a half recipe I was making, not a full recipe!  By the way, the Strata set up just fine and tasted awesome.  Even the leftovers were good.As I planned menus last week, I looked at several recipes.  Many I'd have loved to try or make once more, but I couldn't...They weren't part of my budget balanced meal plan.   I found myself looking at recipes and meal plans overall differently... All because of  that  silly bit of leftover broccoli I wished to use!"},

If then the light in you is darkness, how great is the darkness!Matthew 6:22-23 ESVOur word here is 'Az meaning \"strength\".  It comes from an ancient root word which has a deeper meaning than physical strength.  It denotes spiritual strength.  There is a second word in this verse that begins with 'Ayin and that is 'acharown which means 'latter'.  I referred to the  Proverial Woman in our previous verse as being spiritually prepared.  This verse, in analysis of the Hebrew, gives ample evidence of that.  Her 'clothing' here are truly her spiritual character.  The word that is translated as dignity also translates into 'excellence' and 'majestic',both words which gives an added depth of meaning.  That she 'laughs' represents her joy in  her own latter  days when she is standing before the throne of God.      In my home this week:I had a full week last week.  Guests, traveling, groceries, errands.  John is currently nursing something that appears to be more allergy than a cold but it's wanting to settle in his chest.  He's taking lots of Vitamin C and drinking plenty of fluids.  He's not running fever, so there is that...The entertainment value alone of the bird bath outside the living room windows is awesome.  Right this minute there are two Blue jays and a Red headed Woodpecker squabbling over water rights.  I've seen Blue birds, Cardinals, Mockingbirds and Brown Threshers out there but the Jays are the most predominant.  I think I shall see if I can't set up water in other areas about the yard, and see about getting some bird feeders and seed set out as well.  I've noticed Misu stops by for a drink when she comes back from the fields by the way.  She never bothers the birds, but she will climb the steps and stretch out to drink from the bird bath before heading back to her home base on the front porch."},

{"title": "The Proverbial Woman vs 23", "date": null, "text": "Proverbs 31:23  Her husband is known in the gates when he sits among the elders of the land.Nun(noon)  is the fourteenth letter of the alphabet.  The pictograph for Nun looks something like a sprouted seed.  The sages say this letter represents both the faithful and the rewards of faith.  It means 'fish' and represents life.  Joshua was the son of Nun and on his succession to Moses as he entered the Promised Land was called \"the Son of Life\".I find it interesting that the letter Mem means water and the letter Nun represents fish.  What is a fish without water?!Noda is our first word in this verse.  The lexicon does not have any word which begins with Nun, but another translation of this verse says that her husband sits with distinction.  I am thinking noda  may well be an adverb that describes how he sits in the gates.   If he is sitting with 'distinction' he has not only the right to sit there but is respected among the elders of the city.  Young men might go to the gate but it was the seat of wisdom, a place of judgement and settlements in the ancient city.  It was a place for business deals where reputable witnesses were party to contracts and agreements.  In other words, it was a valuable part of any city.  To 'sit in the gates' one had to have displayed many respectable and admirable traits. Earlier in Proverbs we see this:  Proverbs 8:1-3  Wisdom is calling!  Understanding is raising her voice!  On the heights along the road, where the paths meet, she is standing; by the gates leading into the city, at the entrances...A man was appointed to sit in the gates.  He didn't just decide that was where he belonged.  Deut. 16:18  You are to appoint judges and officers for all your gates [in the cities] Adonai your God is giving you, tribe by tribe; they are to judge the people with righteous judgement.The reputation of a wife could absolve that of a bad husband.  Remember Abigail and Nabal?  When David and his men were hiding from Saul, they watched over the sheep and shepherds, making sure that no harm came to Nabal's property in the wild fields they roamed.  David's men were sent to Nabal and requested provisions, Nabal refused.  Abigail, hearing of how rudely her husband behaved ordered the servants to load up provisions and take to David and his men.  Later, when Nabal died, David remembered this remarkable woman and sent for her to become one of his wives.  (I Samuel 25).   What might Nabal have been had he realized the value of Abigail's wisdom?  No doubt this husband is sitting in the gates as well because his wife is such an exemplary woman.  She has rightly seen that she is a reflection of her husband and his reputation is something she values as much as her own.   I believe again it's her example, not just of her work ethic but of her spiritual wisdom, her compassion to those less fortunate, which elevates herself and her husband in their community. Hello dear.  Do come in and have a cup of coffee with me.  There are those lovely spice cookies to go with our cups, or the little Danish butter cookies.  We have an abundance of sweets this week.  It's both my desire to have a little something and my thought of more impending company though I can't tell you anyone whose meant to be here until two weeks from now.  Yes, indeed, the guest room has been booked once again.   We'll take coffee to the living room and sit by the window so we can watch the birds at the birdbath.  It's warmer by the window with the sun coming in. Less  smoky than outdoors.   And isn't it lovely to at last have cool weather and find our hot drink such a comfort?I was just sitting here smiling over a post I made many years ago on Facebook, one of those 'shared memories'.  In it I proclaimed that henceforth November should be my favorite month of the year and I see no reason to change my opinion.  Monday night I sat there across the room and watched the sun set.  I don't know just when the trees on the horizon went bare...but there the branches were etched black against that lovely panoramic view of the sky highlighted by the beautiful blue and purple and coral of the setting sun.  I don't know why God allots us such beauty at the day's end and beginning but He does and I for one appreciate it.  A day can only seem more lovely when you see the rising sun and the glory of it and no matter how awful it's been, beauty at the end is soothing and reassuring somehow.  It's something too to see you through those long dark hours in between when it's sandwiched between glories. Over the past weekend, we saw our oldest son and his three children.  We so seldom get to see them these days but I did enjoy them.  I watched them scuffle their feet through the fallen leaves and John and I stood smiling at the kitchen window watching the twins stroll slowly back up the driveway as they chatted. Five and Seven are vastly different than Four and Six.  They are more independent in their play which is a blessing.  It meant I could sit by and listen though I appeared to be busy on my own.  I love listening to the imaginings of children as they play.  They were satisfied still with the same toys we've had here since their own infancy.  And they loved the freedom of being able to head outdoors when they wanted and run downhill and back up again.    I was grateful once again for what I was able to pass along to another generation of children, the same joy I'd had visiting here while I was growing up.  I think it's important children have a place to be free and safe at the same time.  How fortunate I am to have that here.  It's a sort of living legacy of Granny's to have bought this place for her children and have wanted her children's children to have it.  Now it's my children's children...This place has been a generational blessing thus far.It was a good visit.  I planned and prepared well and so there was no exhaustive work to do on top of the visit.  The children ate every bite put before them and nary a complaint nor whine over what they didn't like.  Our only squabble was a constant request for juice.  We had juice and we had chocolate milk but just one serving of each and then we also had plenty of good well water.  We don't get to see these children often any more and it's hard for us and them, too.  But it is the way things are.  I guess now they are older they've been thinking and talking about it.  Daniel asked me quietly one evening as he played on the floor near my chair, \"Gramma...do you miss us?\"  \"All of the time...\" I replied.  \"We think about you and talk about you and we look forward to when we can see you again.\"Later while I was brushing out Hailey's hair she said \"I love you, Gramma...I miss you.  I think about you a lot.\"  \"I miss you, too, Hailey.  I think of you, too.  And the next time you're thinking about me, you just remember that I'm thinking of you.  We're together in our thinking of one another.  And when you remember that I'm thinking of you, you remember that I love you very much.\"  It's a lot for a five year old to miss Daddy for six months at a time and to miss grandparents, too.  It's a lot for a seven year old.  There's not much that can be done about it except trust one another's love.I've had time to think about this business of missing grandchildren and grandparents, too.  I shared with you about how seldom we got to spend time with Grandaddy and Grandmama.  Yet, I knew without a shadow of a doubt that they loved us.  It was plain in the way they smiled when they saw us, in the way little things we each favored was remembered.We saw the three children then we spent the day with Katie and Taylor.  We could only visit mid-week this month with all the comings and goings and work schedule.  We missed seeing Matt, but we did get to watch Zoey the 100 pound German Shepherd, lay herself in adoration at John's feet and roll over to expose her belly.  She's a lap dog for all she's 100 pounds.  A very sweet natured doggy and so gentle with Taylor.  Taylor has learned that Zoey's paw pads are sensitive and ticklish, so she'll gently poke at them and laugh out loud as Zoey snatches her feet back out of the way.  Zoey in her turn will give a ticklish swipe of the tongue to Taylor's toes and make Taylor snatch her feet away.  At one point, when Zoey was sleeping on the floor, Taylor lay down with her head resting on the thigh of Zoey's leg and played with a book while she rested against her dog.This will be  a rare month for me.  I'll see Josh next weekend when I go down to see his daddy baptized.  Now there's an answer to years of prayer!  Sam was the one child who has never had a desire to admit he needed salvation.  For whatever reason he truly believed it was enough to be a good person and do good things.  It's hard to explain surrender to someone who sees themselves as strong and able and decent.  And in the end, it's something one must experience for oneself.  It's that personal relationship with God thing I am forever going on about.  I'll see Josh that weekend and on Thanksgiving Day, for the first time in years, I shall spend the day with my three of my children and their children.  Rare indeed!  John shall have to work and will miss it but this is as near together as we've all been on Thanksgiving in nearly 10 years I think.I've thought of Granny a lot these past two days.  For one thing, it's her birth month and that date is drawing near.  For another, I recall a November day when I was off work, when we'd been here just a year, and Granny came up the back steps (no deck or porch then) and knocked on the door.  It was a glorious day.  The trees were bare, the sedge grass in the fields golden as ripe wheat, the skies bluest of blues above and the air brisk.  I had all the windows open and was letting the house 'breathe' as we say it when we're giving the house a good airing.  I'd been busy all morning and had just sat down.  When Granny knocked on the door I wasn't in the least surprised to see her.  \"Come with me.\" she said and we walked the place from front to back.  Not such a lot of walking really but interesting walking with sights to admire and fresh air to blow the cobwebs from our mind and hawks and geese overhead and crows cawing across the fields.  I don't recall a word of conversation.  I recall feeling happy and as though every single thing was right with the world.  I am sure we did talk.  Talking was something we always did with Granny, she was that sort.  The sort that inspired confidences and deep heart to heart talks and soul searching.  I don't recall the conversation but I recall the peace of that day and it's stayed with me in some depth ever since.  Granny had a way about her that made you feel peaceful and at rest somehow.  Shalom peace is what she had.I realized this week that it's been five years since she passed on.  I...  I can't say I miss her.  I do in many ways...but I wouldn't be her granddaughter if I didn't have the gumption to move on with my life.  She did it over and over again.  She lost children and a husband and a grandson.  She lost her parents and a sibling or two.  She went on.  Missing is something you just carry with you, aware there's not a thing you can do to change it.  Missing and remembering and appreciating the time that was. Missing and using every bit of knowledge and wisdom ever imparted.   Missing and knowing that one day we'll meet again.I said no projects for these two months except to finish those we've started.  I bought enough landscape block to finish off the one flower bed this week.  The truth is I'm bored.  I've grown accustomed to being busy. There is still painting to be done.  There are plants, a start for those pretty pots of winter blooms I hope to have.  I promise myself I shall not do any more big projects until the New Year.  There are holidays ahead and taxes and insurance just paid so money needs to be built up once more.  There's plenty of little household tasks that need to be seen to.  There's a holiday this month and I could do a little preparation for that.  There's a full shelf of never before read books and the DVD player Sam gave us this past summer that I keep meaning to get connected to the TV and there are movies to watch.  There's loads of things to do!  And yet I do none of those things and I think ahead to new projects.Speaking of books, I've just finished House of Memory by Richard Collier.  Not a new book but an older one that was on my bookshelf of unread books.  It was really a nice read, a book about the home he grew up in as a boy.  There are not just memories of his life but memories of an era, that space between the end of the Edwardian era and the start of the roaring twenties. The loveliest description in the book involved a normal day for his mother.  The book is a keeper I think, at least for now.Are any of you feeling as world weary as I am at the moment?  I had hoped with the election over and done that we'd move away somewhat from the rants and raves and outcries, but apparently no.  No, there are protests and marches and outrages.   I don't recall an election year that was ever as horrid as this one...I don't want one word from anyone about their candidate winning or losing or dire predictions.  I have been through many a year here on this blog without protesting choices made in elections.    I might well squawk over a law passed that adversely affected my income overall  but I could see the blessing in having income enough to adjust things accordingly.  And do you know, I can't help but feel that we owe a certain loyalty to whomever is in office.  I won'tsay I agree with every single thing done by any president, but it's my country and the person at the helm should be supported.   Change is never easy but change we must if we're to be a proper nation.  So let's all just hush up and get busy with the work we all should do to be our very best!  And remember this: triumph and tragedy, the world goes right on.  Meals to prepare and clothes to mend, people to come home to at day's end and sunrise and sunset will go right on occurring.  I think I mentioned that my insurance coverage is being discontinued after this year.  Fortunately I found a replacement policy that will be about the same amount each month.   At least so says the website.  However, not everyone is as fortunate.  I am referring to Patsy whom many of you know through her blog, A Working Pantry.  Their costs rose so very much that it's going to create a real hardship for tem.  I wanted to suggest, if you all don't mind, that she and other bloggers like her (I'm thinking of Brenda at Coffee Tea Books and Me now and Brandy at Prudent Homemaker) should be supported through their Amazon affiliate links.  I believe I'm correct when I say that if you click on an item they've featured you can go on through to whatever you yourself might need to purchase it will still give them Amazon credit.   As well, if they have a 'support this site' button, then please make a donation.  Even a dollar or two is a help to these bloggers.  If a blogger has Google ad sense take a moment and click through on an ad.  It takes a moment and yet it earns that blogger a cent or two for their time.  I'm talking about giving a helping hand to your favorite bloggers, supporting them in small ways that can cost you little time or effort, just a moment or two of thought.  I often order through Amazon but I only seldom think to use an affiliate link.  Hadn't we ought to try to help?Well, I think I shall wander outdoors and refill the bird bath.  I think it's getting low, because the birds keep picking up leaves and tossing over the edge.  I've had such a nice visit with you and with them (oh look!  bluebirds!).  Come back soon!"},
{"title": "The Proverbial Woman vs. 22", "date": null, "text": "Proverbs 31:22  She makes bed coverings for herself; her clothing is fine linen and purple.Mem is our next letter.  It is the 13th letter of the Hebrew alphabet.  In pictograph this letter looks like a wave of water.  In Hebrew the letter means 'waters' and represents wisdom.  Proverbs 18:4  The words a man speaks are deep water, a flowing stream, a fountain of wisdom.There are other meanings of the word: waters, people, languages, nations.  The form of this letter, with one side open as seen here,  is said to represent the hidden truth of God, revealed.In the lexicon, the word used is Marbad. It is marvadim in the Hebrew version I'm using.  (Since Veronika kindly pointed out that the last two words I was struggling with did in fact have the same meaning as the lexicon words used, I will proceed with using them.  I so appreciate that help!!)  Marbad  is translated as spread or coverlet.  A few translations in English use the word 'tapestry' and indeed the primitive root word from which marbad  is derived is rabad and it means tapestry or covering as well.  Tapestry is a very intricate bit of weaving, and  is usually quite heavy almost like a carpet or rug. This would have been a very luxurious bit of weaving for her bed.  While some translations have used the term 'bedspread', I am not aware enough of the history of tapestry or the times in which our woman lived to know if it truly was a bedspread or if rugs were spread for a bed at that time. I reference this to the story of Jael:  Sisera came to Jael's tent to seek refuge; she gave him milk and rolled him in a rug to hide him...He fell asleep and she took that opportunity to kill him. Judges 4:21.If you read about tapestry making and the intricacy of the work done, how finely woven it is with a pattern worked atop that, then you'll understand that this work required costly threads and meticulous work, as well as a great deal of time.  That she made these coverings for her own bed bespeaks the value of her marriage bed.But there's more...aren't we finding that there always is with this woman?It is her bedroom that she chooses to make lovely with these coverings.  Her bedroom would be a place exclusively for her husband and herself, nost likely an interior room.  It is a place of intimacy.  Surely this is representative of her own relationship with God and the depth of her inner spiritual life. ..her clothing is fine linen and purple.Woman or not, these are priestly colors!  The word used for 'fine linen' is \"shash\"(shaysh).  It literally translates to 'white'.  It is interesting to me to note that the Hebrew word for shash is represented by two shin, another letter of the alphabet, and they look like two crowns side by side.  Purple was a royal and priestly color as well.   The color was acquired by crushing the shells of a certain shellfish from the Mediterranean Sea.  References to the white and the purple are scattered throughout Exodus chapters from chapter 25-28.  These colors were used for both the curtains that surrounded the Holy of Holies and the priests garments worn for duty in the tabernacle.In light of the previous verse it is not hard to believe that she would wear the garments of a priest. It most surely is spiritual clothiing as much as physical clothing and further evidence of the strong role she plays in her home as an example and guide."},
{"title": "In My Home This Week:  Whew!", "date": null, "text": "In my home this week......I don't know just what this coming week will hold. I only expected half of this past week, lol.  Sam and Bess stayed the night one night in the middle of the week on their way to the northern part of the state (that was unexpected). I babysat a sick Josh while they tried to do an errand in the city that night and the next morning their first stop was Urgent care with the boy.  He did not feel well, poor baby.Friday I was trying to order my thoughts towards the arrival of my older son and grandchildren, only to get a text message moments into my planning session  that he was going to arrive FIVE hours early!  Oh dear!  That restful easy pace I'd been thinking would be mine had to go into overdrive and several ideas of things I'd meant to do were tossed away completely.It was a rollicking visit.  Thankfully the weather was slightly cooler, the kids happily roamed and ran and roared about outdoors and then came indoors for quieter (relatively) play.  They cleaned their plates at every meal eating every bit as much as any adult, and pretty much went top speed from morning until Gramma slyly sent them all to bed a half hour early (hey they can't read clocks yet!) and were asleep by 9pm.  It was wonderful, every bit of it.  But 9pm was almost blissful and that's no lie. Typical  of November, we're seeing a bit more color on the trees now.  Last week it felt rather odd to have the AC running most of the afternoon (and into the early evening hours) and to watch leaves drift from the trees at the same time.  There was definitely something wrong with that picture!  Cooler weather blew back in over the weekend, but truly it's not cool in my opinion.  It's 'about right' but it's not cool.  Cool weather to me necessitates a sweater or light jacket and allows me to be quite content to keep them on!   However, the weather man insists upon calling it 'cooler' and even 'cold' (sheesh and he's supposed to be from Nebraska or something...) and so I shall refer to it as 'cool' as well, just to differentiate between pleasant and the stinking hot we've had for what feels like endless months now.There are now chipmunks out back...if Maddie has left any of them alive.  I think chipmunks are cute, far more so than squirrels who tend to be a bit too destructive in their ways however acrobatic and funny they might be.  I was so pleased to see my first chipmunk on the place but at least twice now I've found Maddie feasting.  I have a strong suspicion that in her mind they are just so many more baby rabbits, which she seems to consider a great delicacy.  Sigh...It is her sole indiscretion.  She typically chases birds from tree to tree, or plays tag with the bees.  She admires adult rabbits from a distance.  Any other feasting she does is the result of thievery, because Misu is the huntress in this household.  And no doubt that is how Maddie came to know there were chipmunks about. The blue jays still are loving the bird bath under the pecan tree.  I've been checking it for water levels every day and refilling when needed.  There's one rather persistent mocking bird who is brazen enough to chase away the jays.  And when no other birds are lurking a smaller bird shows up.  I haven't gotten a good look at him just yet, so I don't know what type of bird he is.I have a confession to make:  I've never allowed myself to like blue jays.  Granny disliked them so you see, and told me they had the habit of pushing out other's birds eggs from a nest and leaving their own to be hatched and raised (as does the cuckoo and a few others).  And too, the Blue Jay's cry is persistently 'Thief!  Thief!' which I feel is so hypocritical given their way of foisting off their children on others.  But here in the winters the jays and the red birds are the lively bits of color in an otherwise brown and  grey landscape. And this autumn I've come to appreciate how their blue and gray and white coloring complements the tobacco gold of the pecan leaves.  I don't know that I can quite forget their nature, but I suppose they are just as God made them, and so I will do my best to appreciate the finer things about them...as long as they don't scream 'Thief' at me too often!...I plan my work week: I didn't get to a thing on my list of work for last week...So I'll just transfer it to this week's list.  Now that I'm officially slowing down for a little bit it's all copasetic.  No worries.  I expect things will get done during the month.  It's Harvest week.  Bills, groceries, running errands and all that sort of thing.  I'm trying to plan ahead for the holidays since the next check is the short one and so Thanksgiving dinner must be pretty much purchased this week.  Lots of thinking carefully and at the same time being careful not to stock the pantry but just 'buy what we need'.  It shall be a struggle of sorts but I'll get it done!Paint the kitchen cabinets (finish the last wall).Get guest room cleaned up and ready for the next guests.  I don't know who or when but they're coming, I'm sure of that!John has a long week off this week with no work days so I'll be at the mercy (and fun) of his spontaneous choices.  I'll leave the work plans where they are....I plan meals:Pot Roast with Mashed potatoes, Green Peas and Salad, GingerbreadLeftovers of roast dinnerPolska Kielbasa, Cabbage, Pierogi (or potatoes au gratin if I can't catch the sale at the store on piergoi)deli takeoutTamale Pie, Pineapple SaladCranberry Glazed Turkey Tenderloin (leftover makeover) Brussels Sprouts, Roasted Butternut SquashVegetable Beef Soup, Corn Muffins,  Apple and Pomegranite salad, Snickerdoodles ...I plan my leisure: I hope we can maybe visit Katie this week.  We haven't discussed days or anything yet.  (Katie, don't panic I hope by the time you read this we've talked.  We won't just pop in.)  I would love to get some good Winesap apples and see some fall color if we do go northward."},
{"title": "Weekend Reading", "date": null, "text": "I had links set up for last weekend and simply never got time to post them.  Now I have a long list after two weeks of reading newsfeed and such.  So I thought it best to go ahead and give you all a nice list for this weekend.  It's varied enough I think to interest you.  Enjoy!I love to shop for antiques even though I seldom purchase very many.   This list has the 'best' antique stores in small towns state by state (just one per state) but for goodness sake make sure you go visit those near you in your own states.  I can't name the number of times I've meant to pay a visit and found when I finally broke down and did it that the place had closed up just a month or two before.  It always pains me to think of what I missed seeing.I was surprised at who owns some of my favorite brands...Big corporations have sure taken over a lot of companies.  Great for those small businesses that hopefully made a profit for their product but sometimes if you've noticed a change in a favored  brand a takeover might be why.For those of you who enjoy The Royal Family, I thought this short video and article about the Queen of England was fun.John mentioned the movie, \"The Station Agent\" to me one morning on our way to do errands.  We stumbled upon later that week and stayed up until midnight watching it.  That's a long way past our bedtime!  It's a good film and I thought I'd suggest you to those of you who have Netflix or get the Audience channel on cable.  I was not at all surprised to find St. Augustine on this list of the 'best' small towns in America"},
{"title": "The Proverbial Woman:  Vs. 21", "date": null, "text": "Proverbs 31:21  She is not afraid of snow for her household, for all her household are clothed in scarlet.Lamed  is the twelvth letter of the Hebrew alphabet.  In pictograph it is a shepherd's hook or goad.  It is considered the 'heart' of the alphabet.  The original meaning of lamed is 'to prick, sting, incite, goad'  as a shepherd might goad cattle into movement or action.  The Hebrew name of the letter itself means to teach or to learn and refers to the Torah.     labash is our word in this verse.  It means 'to clothe' but the primitive root word means \"to wrap around\".On the surface of things this woman uses common sense and knows that there are seasons.  She has prepared her family for the season of snow.  We don't have snow often in Georgia, but I would think in an area where there was deep snow that red would most surely stand out.  It is unlikely that anyone wearing red would be 'lost' in snow.Interestingly, when the Hebrew meanings of the words are studied in depth we learn that the scarlet dye was obtained by grinding the dried body of an insect.  It is only the female which produces this color.  I thought this spoke volumes about how our Proverbial Woman has sacrificed herself, in a sense, for her family.As well we cannot forget that it was by blood that the Israelites were saved during that horrible (and wonderful!) night in Egypt when the Israelites were finally able to walk out of the slavery of generations.  And that was a foreshadowing of the blood of the Lamb of God slain for our sins in years to come.One of the pair of tables Mama gifted me this week.  They were purchased from one of her new neighbors whose wife wanted to replace them with square tables.  I am pleased as punch with this gift ad thrilled at the quality of the tables.  Mama got them at a bargain price.Saturday:  Not the sorts of changes we've been making in our home but switching up some of our financial things.  I'll post about it early this week.My first task today was fighting a pile of ants that came in from an unknown spot and got into the two biscuits I meant to put in the freezer to save for stuffing.  No savings there!  I had to throw them outdoors and spent the first 30 minutes of morning spraying, wiping and sweeping up dead ants.  Yuck.Made roast beef hash for dinner.  I cut up extra potatoes so we'd have some for potato soup after church tomorrow.Chopped extra onions to go into sloppy joes and potato soup.Stacked dishes.  I never meant to be cooking today but we went out yesterday afternoon and that threw me off my work plans.Made chicken salad and egg salad for sandwich fillings this week.Bess's mom, Jenny, sent me two big pill cases, the sort that hold a week's worth of pills.  I have one for morning meds and one for evening.  I used a chalk pen to write \"a\" for am on the one box and \"p\" for the evening ones so I'd not mix them up.  I don't trust myself to remember which color is meant for which part of the day!  I am very grateful  for  this kind and thoughtful gift.  It bothered Bess that I set up dosages in two paper cups each day.  I explained that I hadn't found a pill box big enough to hold all of my pills.  Jenny is a nurse and knew just where to source what was needed.  Wasn't that thoughtful?Can you believe it's November?  No, neither can I!  And yet it is.  October is a memory and the weeks ahead suddenly seem to press in upon us.  It all feels like a downhill rush after October doesn't it?   I have not highlighted post this time around, but I did go through and reply to most questions and commented on a few comments, too.  I'm between guests at the moment and have much to do to get ready for the next group, but wanted to get out a post! Aside from the Proverbial Woman posts, all other replies are in order of posting from the first ones this month to the last.  The Proverbial Woman posts will continue until I finish the series up.  I hope to do that in the next week but we'll see how long it takes to research some of these verses and words, lol.  I knew it was delving deeper but I hadn't realized just how much I'd be stretched in writing these posts from a spiritual perspective rather than the practical.  Georgene did ask about what resources I used for these posts and I'll share them with you all.  I used Hebrew4Christians.com to get an understanding of the Hebrew letters.  I used bereansonline, the Eshet Chayil and this site to get a better understanding of the Hebrew meanings.  I used blueletterbible.org  lexicon and Strong's commentaries to get a better understanding of Hebrew meanings of root words.  I have used the random other website but I didn't bookmark those and can't tell you which they were.  Debbie in KS  John and I attended Messianic synagogues for  about 4 years total with a year's break  between year 3 and 4.  We wanted to learn more about the Jewish roots of the Christian faith which frankly was glossed over or 'forgotten' very often by pastors.  The Bible was ALL written from a Hebrew/Jewish standpoint even though the New Testament was largely recorded originally in the Greek language.  Those men who became the first Christians were many of them of the Jewish faith.  Even the Gentiles of the region in that era knew life more from a Jewish standpoint than any other.  It was this fact that led us to go more deeply into study of Torah and Old Testament.  We've discovered some wonderful teachers along the way:  Perry Stone, Jonathon Bernis, Larry Huch, and John Hagee are some of the most outstanding.  I find that today ten years after we'd begun our journey that more and more we hear from the pulpit reminders that our faith has it Hebraic  roots.  Another time perhaps I will write a more indepth post about our experiences.  We feel strongly that we should keep a Sabbath day (not necessarily Saturday but we do) and we do a Sabbath evening prayer and candle lighting service complete with kiddush (communion) each Friday evening.  The Messianic years were pivotal years for us and richly rewarding.   The essence of the tenets of the denomination is that Christ was/is the Messiah.  Many Messianics are Jewish and grew up in the Jewish faith but had a spiritual revelation of Christ in their lives.  Hence many of the Jewish traditions were brought forward with an awareness that all Torah and Talmud foretell the coming of the Messiah who did in fact come to earth. It is a lovely blending of New Testament with Old in Messianic synagogues."},

I did save a good bit but not enough to pay it off. I wrangled figures and I simply cannot swing it. At best, I can manage just about half.  So I'll make that first payment.  It has, however, made me determined to do all I can to front load all those annual fee accounts and set those funds aside in full, immediately.  I've thought long and hard about this and how to go about it.  I said earlier in the year I'd use overtime, windfalls and holiday pay in smarter ways.  It seems to me that tackling those small fees and annual renewal accounts first with those monies and having it all set aside is a good way to do that.  I can put them in a separate savings account meant just for that purpose."},

Prayer time, Bible study, menus, goals....Just skimming.Frankly I'm not fond of this state but it occurs now and again whether I mean it to occur or not.  Sigh.  I'm not bored, not in the least.  I'm not over tired nor overly busy.  I'm just not accomplishing much of anything for all that I appear to be busy at all times.  And my mind just won't truly quiet off, as I like it to do so that I can read and study and delve and create.  Reusing old things (this frame has been on the front porch for the past five years) is one way I stretch and stretch my decorating budget...Saturday:  The cold wind of autumn finally blew in yesterday.  It was cold enough to snuggle last night and we did turn on the heat for a moment this morning, just long enough to bump the indoor temperatures up to 67F.I'd planned to have leftovers today but with a bagel and coffee for breakfast, something more substantial and warming seemed in order.  Pot roast with a pineapple upside down cake sounded good to me and came together in minutes.The Pineapple upside down cake used up the half can of pineapple rings I had left.  I used the juice in the cake in place of the milk the recipe called for.I used the electric frying pan to make the pot roast since I decided a little late to start it.  I don't use that fryin pan very often...And honestly after today I'm thinking there's little reason to keep it.  It cooked awfully fast compared to the stovetop.  This appliance was a gift to me and wasn't something I'd normally have chosen for myself.  I think today made up my mind to let it go to a home that will appreciate it.Last night after supper, before sundown, I put together the rice and chili left from last weekend and made up 7 burritos to go into the freezer."},

Perceive means to 'become aware or conscious of, to understand'.  Discern means 'to recognize; to distinquish between'.  The word used here for merchandise is 'chacar'  the same as the word used in verse 14.  It means to 'go about, to travel'.  I believe that in this instance she is continually examining her motives and actions, distinguishing between them what is all too human and what is spiritually right.Her merchandise in this instance is truly the value of her character and her actions. Isaiah 23:18  For her merchandise and her hire shall be holiness...This woman knows her personal value is truly based upon her character, who she is in private as well as in public.   I think we as women struggle with this.  I know I did.  I had no clue what my value was as a person, as a woman, a wife, a mother.  I had to learn these things and if I could change much about my past, I'd choose to change those choices I made that failed to recognize my worth and the 'profit' of my example to others.  I would not have allowed certain behaviors, on my part or others', that discounted my worth.Her lamp does not go out at night.  Immediately, this passage reminds me of the passage of the bridesmaids in Matthew 25:1-13 where five of the ten bridesmaids showed up without oil for their lamps.  They were unprepared and missed the coming of the bridegroom.  This Proverbial woman is prepared spiritually.  She is, I think, also secure in any battles she might face.  Dark times come to us all.  We struggle with big issues at times.  This woman is aware that even in the darkest hours,  her spiritual lamp does not go out. She is safe in her God.Matthew 5:14:  You are the light of the world...This verse too speaks of this woman, of any of us, who  have sought after that personal relationship with God (and for Christians the relationship with Christ). We take on the light of his presence, and  shine out into the dark world about us."},
{"title": "Proverbs 31 Woman:  Strong At Heart", "date": null, "text": "31: 17 She dresses herself with strength and makes her arms strong.Chet (Cate as in mate) is our eighth letter and is represented in pictorals by a fence.  Some Jewish mystics say that Chet is the light that comes through from the doorway of heaven.  It represents life and wisdom and because it is the eighth letter it also said that it represents grace.The letter Chet is formed from both Vav and Zayin connected by a thin line.  This is believed to be because it is love which makes us as one with God.  The letter is often used to represent life and because of it's shape, it is said that it is the same form in which the blood of the lamb was painted upon the doorposts of the homes of the Israelites in Egypt on that first Passover.  Often this letter is associated with new beginnings.The word in the verse is chagrah and it translates \"to gird oneself, as with a belt or armor\".I happened to hear a commentary on this verse just the other day.  In it, the teacher said that the woman had pulled up her skirts and tucked them into her waistband much as peasant women had done while working in the fields for years upon years.  That is certainly a vision of a woman hard at work isn't it?  And coming on the heels of reading of her purchase of a field and planting a vineyard it is most certainly an apt vision.For all this I could not forget that the letter's pictograph represented a fence.  Why a fence?  What do fences do?  They protect.  They keep out the unwanted and contain that which is valuable to us.  Fences are usually our first line of defence in battle.   I cannot help, in reading this verse but   to think of  Eph. 6:10 Finally be strong in the Lord and in his mighty power. 11 Put on the whole armor of God, so that you can stand against the Devil's schemes.  Reading the Lexicon verses in which the word chagrah nearly all of them refer to armor or weapons.So I do not feel I am far wrong in thinking that this verse, in a spiritual sense, represents the preparation of this woman for battle.In drawing closer to God, we must, above all, learn to be spiritually strong.  Otherwise we will not grow in our relationship with him because we will be distracted and overtaken by a world of cares orchestrated by satan to keep us from our purpose.   In the same way, when the blood of the lamb was painted upon the doorposts of the Israelite homes, God told them to spread that blood in order to protect themselves during the spiritual battle that raged about them.   Hence, when this woman dresses herself with strength and makes her arms strong  it is surely a simile of her readying herself for spiritual battle.  Sometimes it is enough to put on the armor, to show oneself ready for battle and aware of the raging wars between earth and heaven.  But  we see in this verse that indeed, she makes her arms strong.  She has gone the extra distance to be fully prepared to fight if necessary.  She has disciplined herself as a soldier, going back to verse 10 and  the word chayil which I shared had a meaning of army.  She is an army because she will not fight alone as a solitary soldier but has aligned herself with God and his hosts of angels to do battle."},
{"title": "The Proverbial Woman:  A Lasting Harvest", "date": null, "text": "31:16  She considers a field and buys it; with the fruit of her hands she plants a vineyard. Zayin in pictograph looks like a sword and the meaning of the word is sword or weapon, but the root word means sustenance or provision.  The word is paradoxical. It implies that sustenance must somehow be wrested by an act of destruction of some sort.  The word which begins with zayin in this verse is 'zammah'.  It means 'to consider', not in an offhand manner but to think long and deeply, with purpose and planning.On the surface of it,  this verse points out that women in that time period were able to own property in their own right.  She considers a field...and she buys it. She assessed the possibilities of the land, she knew the value of it. Perhaps this was the decision that she struggled with.  Perhaps the wresting has more to do with the planting: with the fruit of her hands she plants a vineyard.  A woman who plants a vineyard. It doesn't say she bought a vineyard, she bought a field.  Turning a field into a vineyard is hard work.  And here I think is a portion of the meaning of the paradox in zayin.The Hebrew word which represents 'fruit of her hands' is 'peiry' and translates 'fruit of her efforts'.The letter zayin is the seventh letter of the Hebrew alphabet and represents the number 7, and the seventh day, the Sabbath.  The Sabbath day is a day of rest.  The paradox of a letter that represents the seventh day in a verse about something that is clearly labor is not without purpose.  Nor is the symbol of a sword, a weapon of warfare, without purpose. And let us not forget the 'sustenance' meaning of the root word.  Just exactly what is going on here?\"...Man does not live by bread alone but by every word that comes from the mouth of God.\" Deut. 8:3Exodus 20:8 tells us that the Sabbath day is a day of rest.  I can tell you sincerely that in my experience keeping the Sabbath involves a lot of work!  In order to rest on that day, I must prepare our meals the day before.  I have to plan well ahead and anticipate what our needs might be (consider the field) during that day.  While we are not legalistic and we do sometimes prepare food or even wash dishes if there are a good many of them, it's always a struggle to not get caught up in the busyness of the usual weekly work day and to stay mindful of the spirit of the day: to rest, restore, refresh and renew.  It is a 'new crop' of sorts, a refreshed energy for the week ahead, that drives us to observe Sabbath, as much as the opportunity to spend the day acknowledging the wisdom of God's word and work in our lives.  It is truth that to reach this day and fully relax, it requires a good amount of work.  I find it is more than worthwhile, but there are six days to do seven days worth of work.  I believe what we see in this verse is the Proverbial woman carving out time for God, considering the goodness of her God,  planting a crop of obediance thru the Torah law of keeping the sabbath.  And the example she sets becomes the long lasting harvest represented by the vineyard . That example is the fruit of her efforts that comes from living righteously."},

{"title": "Frugal Friday:  Upside Right", "date": null, "text": "Saturday:  Made a roasted chicken for dinner.  I kept the seasoning on it simple and cooked it in a slow oven.  The warmth very appreciated this morning as it was quite cool.We took morning coffee on the front porch.  The air was crisp, the breeze slightly chilly.  I wore a sweatshirt and jeans.  Maddie seemed right at home in her fur coat.  The sun shone brightly and the sky was clear and blue.  It was absolutely lovely.I mixed leftover baked sweet potatoes with the leftover roasted butternut squash and made a Sunday Sweet Potato/Squash casserole to have with our roast chicken dinner.  It was delicious!We had enough leftovers for a second meal from the casserole and chicken.Ran a very full load of dishes.  Shorter wash and air dried.Sunday:  I made French Toast this morning.  I just thawed and reheated.  With an egg and sausage each it was an ample breakfast.Took water and a granola bar with me for after church since we planned to go by Lowes.  It's always Lowes or Home Depot for us these days.  We've decided that either one is the new Walmart in our lives.  Picked up paint for the bathroom wall and cabinets, the right paint for the last dining room chair, a tub of sample paint for the soon to be record cabinet, hooks to hang my mixer attachments and  something else...All necessary to tend to jobs here.  John stopped at the supermarket to get a paper.  There were none.  Instead he came out of the store with dinner in the bag.  Unexpected but his treat. Sweet!After dinner John painted the bathroom wall and then worked on my shed door.  The handle broke and it couldn't be locked but he took care of it.Light supper after our late late dinner.Come in and join me with a glass of tea on the porch.  It's very nice out with that nice breeze.  Not cool but it does temper it a bit.  I've had quilts and curtains and our spread hanging on the line today.  Our bedroom smells so fresh and lovely since the sheets and towels went out yesterday.  I removed the living and dining curtains and washed those and hung out the quilts we use as lap robes in winter to air.  I cleared our bathroom of curtains and bench cover and valances and removed the curtain in the  laundry and kitchen/kitchen sitting,  as well.  All  are washed and packed neatly away until the new flooring is in. It's fall cleaning and removal of unnecessary things at one time.   So it looks a bit like we're in the process of moving really with all the pictures down and the curtains removed and pieces of furniture moved out as well...I contemplated earlier the fact that with the books packed up the bulk of my home was packed away.  16 boxes...I had no idea I still had so many books!  However, as I put them back on the shelves I shall do my utmost to cull still more.  I know full well I am holding on to some that I've neither read nor enjoyed reading.  I've held on to them because they are sets that I'd purchased long ago. Books I thought I ought to read.  Books I thought I ought to have for the children to read.  Books I've never read...I think it's time to let them go.Yes, I did say it seems like I'd packed up nearly everything in packing the books but I know too well that I'd be overwhelmed if it came to emptying every single closet, drawer, cabinet, shed.  Yep.  I know because when we moved in here 20 years ago that's what we had to do and I've often wanted to move again to just about anywhere but here but in the end, I am glad I haven't had to pack up house and home to do it!  John used to say that we'd just move and carry along our undies and a few clothes and start again and these days I'm certainly sort of inclined to think I'd just as soon myself!  Not that we are currently in any danger of moving, of course.  We purposely bought the house we did because we knew it would be suitable for older age and for two.  There may well come a day when we need to move into town where there's less lawn and less need of upkeep, but for now that is far in the future.I've been enjoying the work done on the Proverbs 31 Woman series I've taken up.  It's been fascinating to see a deeper spiritual life in this woman.  It's also been tough at times.  I wrote four posts over the last weekend but when it came to the fifth I very nearly quit.  I questioned who I was to think I could teach a single thing, much less something of this depth.  I worried.  I felt anxious.  I went back and rewrote the previous four posts.  I came very near deleting them all.  Then I had a revelation about the troublesome post and it was like watching puzzle pieces fall into place.   I wrote post number six the next morning in ten minutes time.  I will keep going now I've started but they may be staggered as I catch up with myself.  I know I'll be without Internet at least once next week and we've  had unexpected family come  in this week."},
{"title": "The Proverbial Woman:  Home is Where the Heart Is", "date": null, "text": "31:11 Her husband has full confidence in her and lacks nothing of valueThis verse is represented by the Hebrew letter Bet (pronounced \"bate\") and the pictorial symbol represents a house.There are two words in this verse which both begin with bet.  The first is the word 'ba'al' and in translation it is 'husband' 'master'.  Here is a point where many feminists begin to twist and turn in their seats...The idea of husband as 'master' of woman is abhorrent. I have to share this bit of Jewish history with you.  While it's very popular in this day and age for women to become rather riled at the idea of 'submitting' to a husband, and the word master might well be found offensive, in Jewish culture a woman was not just so much chattel to her husband.  She was a partner and an asset, a helpmeet, as we learned last lesson.  While it is true that a woman came into a marriage via a bridal price, it was not for mere monetary reasons.  The bridal price was to remind the husband that his bride had value.  It cost him something to wed her.  He literally had to 'earn' her. Think back to Jacob who had to work 14 years for Rachel and take her sister Leah as his first wife in the process!  It most definitely is not a picture of a man merely buying a woman!   As well, when the bride went to her husband, she took with her a dowry.  This dowry often was household goods, but it sometimes included jewelry, silk and tapestries, livestock and money, as well.  This was for her own added security, to both provide for her needs now and something for her future needs until her household was established."},
{"title": "The Proverbial Woman - From the Beginning", "date": null, "text": "For quite a stretch of time, John prayed the Proverbs 31 verses over me every Friday night.  As he prayed, I began to pay close attention to the words and to want to be this woman.  In the past, I'd read this particular proverb and wondered at this woman who is described in various interpretations as a woman of valor, virtue, character, worth, excellence.  I  read from many reputable sources (not the Bible!) what an impossible task it was to become the Proverbs woman, that it was meant only as a guideline, was not relevant to the modern day woman, or the modern day family dynamics where men often cook, clean, become househusbands... but you know I've come to see that women CAN become the Proverbs 31 woman.   She is not 'just a homemaker', which I think is a high calling in any woman's life, nor is she 'just a wife'. She is a woman.In the opening of this proverb we read that King Lemeul's mother taught him these proverbs when he was young and standing at her knee.  She reminds him that he was dedicated to the Lord in his childhood.  She warns him to stay away from women (in casual relationship) and to forgo strong drink which is apt to harm his judgement.  She reminds him of his duty to those who are needy and the right of the poor to find justice with their king, as much as any rich man.  And she instructs her son in choosing a wife.During our years as Messianic Christians I  acquired  The Complete Jewish Bible and I noted that the Hebrew alphabet letters were given a place in order beside verses 10-31.  Each of those letters represented a key word in Hebrew that was the heart of that verse. A man who studied Hebrew had kindly given me the word to correspond to each letter.  I'd written them down in my Bible.  What a lot I learned during the study of those words and the subsequent study of the verses!  I'd like to share those with you over the month of October.  I'll do it verse by verse until we've made our way through each one.  Will you join me?"},

She had a pleasant face and a ready smile.  A few weeks ago, I began a project at church and she volunteered to partner with me.  Little did I know what a powerful witness she would be to me.As we worked on the project and prayed over it, I became aware that she had a strong prayer life, far stronger than my own.  I could feel the very deep relationship she had developed with God thru prayer and I was grateful she had chosen to partner with me on the project.Two weeks ago, it was announced that Joanne had a severe health problem and had been hospitalized.  Yet even ill, her faith stood strong and in record time she was out of the hospital and back at church."},

Should be able to buy blocks this week to finish that up.Start next area (South end of the house).  I'm working my way around the house at present.  At the very least I want to buy some materials.  Not this month!Move the iris next to my shed to another spot now that John needs that area cleared.  It's too dry to move the iris and all the other plants I'd hope to move.Move the lantana from the rose bed.  If no one volunteers to help me, I'll likely just cut it back and try to kill it off.  I usually can uproot enough to move elsewhere and establish it.  We'll see.Take cuttings of the forsythia to try and root.Try to root cuttings of the New Dawn rose.Plant pots about house for fall/winter months.  There are plants that do very well here in the cooler months: parsley, pansies, evergreens, mums, snapdragons.  Also if it's mild enough I can plant lettuces but it's supposed to go into the 40's twice this weekend.  That's November temps for us...Plant the bulbs I bought: grape hyacinth and daffodils.Indoors: I hope to get the house settled once more after the flooring is done.Paint wainscoting and cabinetry in bathroom. 1 cabinet to go in the bathroom...will do this one this weekFind paint for that fourth dining chair and get a proper coat on it.Paint inside back door...Preferable to do this before new flooring goes in.  too late...but John says I must have a roller with a deeper nap on it to do the door properly.  Will try to pick one up this week.Start painting kitchen cabinets.Refinish the table currently between mine and John's chairs. Get Pantry and freezer cleaned, organized and inventoried.  Hopefully this last week of October.Other:Pay off medical bill that came in late September. Paid 1/3 of it.  Plan to pay rest this next pay period.  I don't have quite enough to pay it off this pay period and it's due now so I'll send what I have, but I'll only owe $15 on it next pay period and will pay it off then.Get John's Christmas ordered.Plan all upcoming holidays from table settings to menus to decorations.  Start gathering things to make it happen. Planned Thanksgiving for two.  Need to do trial run of table setting.  No...realized I'd donated the plates I'd meant to use.  I'll have to rethink that Thanksgiving table.Plan fall outfits starting with what I have.Purchase pajamas, robe, underthings, slippers. And 1 bra...I have money set aside to shop with.Do all I can to try to pay off house insurance in full when it renews next month. So far I've about 1/3 of the money needed to pay in full.  I don't know if I'll make this goal or not but I'll pay all I can on it.  Carbohydrates are necessary foods in any diet.  That is why you've never heard of a NO carb diet.  No, you might well eat lower carb foods but you will eat some form of carbohydrate.  When it comes to carbohydrates it's what you eat and when that is key to sound nutrition.  Carbohydrates produce energy.  The body does this by converting carbohydrates food into one of two forms: starch or sugars.  Starch is produced when you eat grains, cereal, pasta, rice, bread and some vegetables such as potatoes and winter squash.   Sugars are produced from the natural sugar content of the foods you eat: most leafy greens, peppers, tomatoes, carrots, beets, fruits and dairy and from those items which contain additional sugars such as baked goods or soda.  Even meat products have a low carbohydrate count.  Nearly all the food we eat does. Many of the carbohydrate rich food items also contain something else that is of major importance in a healthy diet: fiber.  Fiber can be found in raw fruits and vegetables and whole grains and to a lower extent in canned or cooked fruits and vegetables.   Fiber not only helps make us feel full when we eat, it also promote healthy intestines and flushes out unnecessary fats.  It soothes systemic inflammation, balances levels of healthy bacteria  to aid in digestion, removes toxins and excess estrogen to thin bile from the liver and will slow the absorption of glucose, controlling blood sugar spikes and decreasing the risk of diabetes.Recommended daily allowances  of carbohydrates in a healthy eating plan varies.  It depends upon many factors: activity level, how often you eat, medications, blood sugar control and cholesterol levels.   Most people require between 30-75 grams of carbohydrates per meal and 15 -30 grams per snacks.   There are no rock hard guidelines.  It is a balance each individual must find for himself.  A good place to start is with 45-60 grams per meal and 15 grams per two snacks daily.  Some people find it easier to count carb choices.  The right number of choices can be between 2 and 5 servings of carbs per meal and 1-2 servings per snack.    Either method works just fine. The key is to find the right number of carbohydrates for you.  The right number of carbohydrates will result in better blood sugar balance and neither weight gain nor loss.  Obviously if you must gain or lose weight then you'd adjust your caloric intake overall and increase or decrease carbohydrates and proteins.Briefly the recommended foods required for proper carbohydrate intake are: 2-3 servings of fruits per day and  3-6 servings of vegetables daily."},
{"title": "Eat Health:  Why We Need the Foods We Eat", "date": null, "text": "One of the things I've learned over the past year or so of studying nutrition and dietary needs is that all foods act together for a healthy body.  You can't cut out a whole food group and remain healthy.  All parts of the food groups are as necessary as all parts of the body working together. A nutritionally sound diet consists of Proteins, Carbohydrates and Fats.  Over time, our vision of a nutritionally sound diet has changed.  Look at the following images, in the order they are given and just see the changes from one to the other.  Both are US Government recommendations, one based on what our parents were told was a healthy diet and one based on what the government studies reveal is now healthy?  Why the change?  For one thing, the availability of foods overall has changed.  For another, we've moved from a nation that was formerly one in which people worked long hours at hard physical labor.  With industrialization and the elimination of manufacturing and agricultural jobs, our calorie requirements changed considerably.    You may left click and open any of these images in a new tab.  They will appear slightly larger there and be more easily read.You'll note this first chart relies heavily on carbohydrate rich foods.  Those were very necessary for energy and endurance.   And from my readings of 1930's and 1940's magazines I can tell you honestly that often those 2 servings of protein daily were sketchy ones.  Look at the current recommended dietary needs as portrayed by myplate.gov"},

One morning as I prayed, my attention was captured by the trees surrounding the cabin.  I noticed first the huge old pine tree that stood just inches from the screened porch.  Then I saw at the foot of the pine tree lots of smaller pines, some only 6-8 inches high.  I found myself completely absorbed in the wonder of those trees.  I felt in my spirit that God was trying to reveal something to me, some essential that I'd missed, but I never quite captured the thought.  I looked at the pinecones on the larger tree and wondered how old the small trees would have to be before they too bore pinecones.In my mind, I saw the young pines on a piece of farmland near my home, trees no taller than I with their spires of  blooms.  Were they of age to bear pinecones?  I pondered the trees for quite a while  but still I felt I was missing  what God wanted me to understand.   I took a scrap of paper and wrote down \"Pine tree\" and tucked the paper into my Bible.  I even took  a picture of one of the tiny pine trees.  I wanted very much to know what God was trying to impart and so I tried to make sure I had reminders of what he'd tried to teach me that morning on the porch."},

It is staying so very clean of late.  I am pretty sure it's because it's simply hot here still.  I am so looking forward to cooler air! I don't want to move too much indoors and haven't done a thing outdoors.   But it's more than that hot weather.  We are not messing the house up very much at all.  I'm not sure quite what that is all about.  It may be because John keeps moving things away from the wall and cleaning under them.  He bought more of those handy furniture gliders this week. Now every big hulking big piece of furniture we have has them permanently under their feet.  We have spare sets to put under the smaller pieces we can easily lift.  These things are so very handy!Anyway, the need to not do housework left me plenty of time to finish up some posts last week.  Hopefully this means I'll have a bit more content up for the next few  weeks.  I stayed busy enough  just the same.  I don't seem to have gotten very much done in the leisure department, but I did get a haircut.  I spent a lot longer than anticipated in a new salon getting my hair done.  Oh the joy of having your hair come out exactly right!  I told John it was so fun to hand the stylist the photo I wanted my hair to look like and then I watched it take shape on me.  I felt as though I could have floated out of the door.  I managed to finish another creative project, a short table runner that is fall inspired.  I am waiting until we're done with all the moving before I put it out."},

{"title": "The Household of the Ant", "date": null, "text": "photo source: www.photographyblogger.netI was recently reading through the book of Proverbs and was, as always, intrigued by the references made to the ant.   As a child, I often lay upon the ground and watched ants as they worked busily.  I loved to watch them on their self-made super highways traveling from job site to ant mound and back again, often in as many as six lanes, three headed out and three headed in. Considering how frequently we battle them here, I was curious as to why the Bible mentioned them at all.  Well with good reason, as it turns out.  Here's what I read and what I learned in research.Solomon mentions the ant in Proverbs 6:6-8  Take a lesson from the ants, you lazy fellow!  Learn from their ways and be wise!  For though they have no king to make them work, yet they labor hard all summer, gathering food for the winter.  (TLB)  Other versions say, \"having no king, or overseer, or ruler, provides her supplies in summer and gathers her food in the harvest.\"And Agur, in Proverbs 30:24-25:  There are four things that are small but unusually wise:  The ants are not a strong people, but they prepare their food in the summer.

She was active right up to the last moment, and as I entered her house, it was, as usual, spotless.  Grandmother had grown up poor, the oldest of six, five of whom she raised while her mother worked in the cotton mill.   Her upbringing made her especially careful of her possessions.  30 year old living room furniture looked brand new.  Appliances were polished until they gleamed.  To the end, her life was personified by the great care she took to preserve her home and make it attractive.  I've written often of Grandmother and her frugal ways.  She was my inspiration when I first married and began keeping house.  It has taken me many years to transform my life in such a way that my home was able to reflect the calm and peace that hers did.  And I sincerely believe it was the tranquil peace within her that shone out in her home.  It was attractive, clean, and well arranged.  No one ever entered her door without being offered something from her plentiful pantry.  She gardened and preserved foods, she sewed, and she renovated her home.  Grandmother never walked anywhere without trotting a little as she went.  She was forever about the business of homemaking and rushing to get it all done, but the moment company came in, she sat right down and enjoyed them."},

Most recently Sam and family moved in and out again about 8 weeks later.  John's job has been the same job but he's changed shifts four times over the 20 years we've been here.  We've added family members and lost some of them.  In essence:  we've lived perfectly normal lives in our home but each change has changed us and therefore our home has changed with it.  And yet...And yet, there were many things that didn't change.  Books remained upon shelves, things inside cabinets and drawers might have shifted places but they've been in this house since the beginning days.  Now they are being moved out and that makes this all feel a bit different.  I've noted that once you move things you've held onto for a long time you seldom return them to their former place, if you return them at all.  Letting go, even partially, often means letting go entirely when it's all said and done."},

The don't need to buy list is so I don't have a stockpile of things that I may not use for a while. For instance, if I find a really good sale on shampoo and buy several I put it on the don't buy list. If I notice something that I don't need right now, but might need soon that goes on the next month list so I can watch for sales, coupons, etc. Saves that old finding something at the back of the cupboard that should have been used a while ago to be at its freshest. When I make my list I always consider cheaper options. This is a good way to save a bit. If I write down a certain kind of cereal but I know there is another kind I like just as well that is what I get unless I have my mind made up I need a certain item, nothing else will do and it is well worth the extra. It seldom is.Debbie: Great posts and ideas!  I was wondering about your internet provider. Did they offer you a discount because of their shoddy service?  We found that our DISH TV, which we also bundled with our internet and phone service, gave us a lower price because of their \"outages\".

{"title": "Boot Camp Graduation:  KP Duty", "date": null, "text": "Of all the areas where I strive to save money, the grocery category is always the one I focus on hardest.  I focus here because for us, it is the highest spending category for us.  Yes, it is, despite years of cutting costs!  It's not that we eat loads of high priced foods but my grocery budget includes: foods, personal care, pet foods, paper products and cleaning products.  I can say day and night that it oughtn't to include any of those things but it does, and it will until the  end of my days...Which leads to my first cost cutting method:Determine once and for all, how much I shall allot to each grocery category of food, cleaning, personal care, paper and pet foods.  And keep those other things strictly separate from my food budget!  I find it reasonable to suggest at present that I allot $10/ a month to pet foods.   This will purchase a large bag of food for Maddie (16 pounds) or for the cat (10 pounds).  I will set aside $10 for paper products (paper plates, napkins, paper towels and toilet paper) and $10 for personal care items.  I will set aside $5 for cleaning products.  I think an envelope system would work best for these amounts.Now what follows are random thoughts, written out just as I captured them when I was brainstorming:  I've yet to decide what my target for groceries shall be.  I'm waiting to make that decision a little bit later due to the fact that John received a small raise.  It remains to be seen if this will lower our income (in case we are in a new tax bracket) or actually be a help.  I can't determine that until John has received a couple of pay checks.I don't want to give up the purchase of that good quality beef we like...but I am going to price and see if the one market that has weekly sale prices on good ground beef isn't the best market for that item.  John has also asked me to check prices at The Fresh Market on the other cuts of beef we normally would buy.  If it is the same price, the savings in gasoline alone makes it worthwhile to shop there instead.  It is another 'wait and see, check it out' thing, but it possibly will save us a little.  Not buying such a large quantity at once also will save.  Now that I've just the one freezer, I do need to decrease my stocking up to the space available.I think we'll be cutting down on other cuts of beef and living mostly on chicken and ground meat.  It's one way I can trim costs.  Though I really like the chicken breasts from The Fresh Market, the best buy still is whole chickens from the market in the next town.  They've been $.88 a pound for the whole birds, but recently were just $.75 a pound which is a fairly big drop in price.  That will definitely be the bulk of my chicken purchases since I am very adept at cutting a whole bird into parts."},
{"title": "Boot Camp Graduation  Part 2", "date": null, "text": "Continuing with my ideas for savings after finishing my frugal boot camp.  Groceries is one of our biggest expense areas and I'm saving that for a whole separate post. The items listed here are in no particular order.Insurances: Car, Home, MedicalI have researched car and home insurances so often that I'm an old pro at it.  I think we're about as low as we're going to get on car insurance and our home insurance is such a good policy that reputable insurance agents have encouraged us to keep it and not switch policies.  I'll bow to the experts on that score.  We've been taking advantage of the monthly payment option with both car and home insurance.  If we can pay the house insurance annually and the car insurance in six month increments we'd save a substantial bit of money, almost enough to cover six months of car insurance.  This is something I am going to try and focus upon in the coming year, saving enough ahead to pay those amounts in full when they come due.  Occasionally as an incentive they offer a substantial discount and that would be the time to take advantage and make the switch so I can maximize the savings.I'll have to find a new provider for health insurance next year.  In the meantime, we are just managing to make that payment each month.  Really there is nothing I can do in this area.ClothingJohn wears a basic wardrobe that doesn't vary.  It's the same in season and out.  He buys multiples of shirts in the one or two colors he prefers and ditto for his jeans and caps.  He says he's boring.  I say his method is incredibly thrifty, lol.One thing I've learned over this past year with limited clothing choices is that I am very nearly completely satisfied with a basic set of clothing myself.  If I learned anything from my husband it was the ease of a 'capsule wardrobe'.   I have begun a list of items I want for my wardrobe that I think will make it a little more versatile.  I need a nice pair of  pants in a good neutral, a blouse or two in compatible neutrals, a blazer in a good solid neutral.  I won't be an all black, or all gray sort as my accessories will lend the color needed to liven up outfits.  I'll buy those at thrift stores or off clearance racks as I always have.   And like John I'll buy certain basics in bulk (think 3 white tee shirts or two white blouses in different styles).  I think this will net me far more mileage than a couple dozen new items each season ever could."},
{"title": "Iced Tea Chat:  Fleeting Summer", "date": null, "text": "Hello, hello, hello!  I thought I'd take a little time to have an iced tea chat.   The front lawn is strewn with yellow stars under the Sweet Gum tree.  I love the sight of the yellow stars strewn haphazardly over the green lawn.  Reading back through old posts, this is a familiar sign this time of year.  It is a reminder of fleeting summer days, as is the slightly later dawn, the later hour of the sun slanting in the western windows and the earlier dusky evenings.  As we went down the driveway to church on Sunday, John said, \"Ooh!...but then we're getting close to September...\" as we came near the Sweet Gum tree.  \"Yes,\" I said sighing, \"we are...unfortunately.\"\"Unfortunately?\"   \"Yes, because it means summer is very nearly over.  Peaches will be gone by end of the week...\"  Also over are all the plans made for these glorious days.  Too late to bring them all about this year.  The season is nearly done.  Time to think of autumn and what I'd like to do in these months ahead.But end of summer is not without charm.  Here in August we can start to expect a few cooler days.  Not exactly chilly but cooler temperatures.  Seasonal changes start to show and add to the anticipation of the coming season, but don't subtract from the last lovely days of the current one.  I find this time of year I'll stand in the sun for a bit and soak it in, too aware that come winter I'll long for hot summer sun.  I will make a big pot of soup or chili.  I shared that idea with Mama today as we puttered about, after talking about how pleasantly temperate the weather was.  \"Chili...I've been thinking I'd like a pot of chili.\"  And Mama nodded and said \"Or a good bowl of beef stew...\"  Obviously she feels the same way I do about the waning summer days.I received a note from a dear friend yesterday.  Her daughter was in labor.  She'd written me earlier in the week, puzzled about how a Grandmother feels when she has her first grand babe in arms.  I explained to her how it was for me.  While I'd had to come to know my own little babies and  realize they were not a stranger of any sort, and I'd had that overwhelming sense of all I didn't know or understand and I was responsible for this tiny thing, when I saw my first grandchild (and all the others I was privileged to greet) I simply felt awash with love.  This child, even more than my own, was truly blood of my blood and flesh of my flesh and heart of my heart.  The mystery of who they were was a fun one I would watch unfold.  The experiences I'd had raising their mama or daddy had filled me with confidence I wasn't privileged to have long ago.  I had no grave concerns.  I had love and nothing but love.You know what?  Boot Camp is tough!  Seriously....I spent so much time reading and researching and thinking, that my head ached several days in a row, lol.  Did I learn anything?  Yes, I did.  I was reminded of much and I came to appreciate afresh the work that goes into living frugally.  Yes, work.  It's not just a matter of saving, it's creating the savings in the first place sometimes.So I did just loads of studying and reading and note taking.  As my last test of Frugal Fitness, I sat down with a pen and paper and covered over eight pages front and back with things to incorporate into my frugal life. Eight pages...and lest you think I'm being repetitive and merely writing down what I did two years ago, no...There are a few that are repeated because I need to continue to practice hard at that particular mindset/skill or because I never incorporated them and I should at least try, but some of these are new to ME, though not necessarily new.  It is sobering, after all these years of attempting to leave frugally and well, to discover how much more one might be doing.  I am not interested in living in a deprived way but I do want to be a good steward of our resources and I do indeed want to determine where I might save a little more, in order to make the best of what we have, as well as to add whatever I might to our retirement years.I took my budget sheet and worked my way down each category and listed savings means for each that I might use to trim costs further.  This is the way we paid off our debt load. It is the way we will successfully retire on a low budget.  I find it a little disheartening at times to look at how slowly raises came over the last fifteen years, how costs have risen,  and how many avenues we've employed only to have them dead end, but we travelled each path as long as we feasibly could and new pathways opened from there.  In order to not be overwhelmed, I will take one item from each category and work upon it until I have become mistress of it and then incorporate another.  I don't want to overwhelm myself.  Boot Camp is meant merely to fire the creative thinking parts of my brain and it worked very well.  Now the real training begins."},
{"title": "Shhh!  Be Quiet!", "date": null, "text": "It was so annoying....The two behind us in church today talked loudly through the music service, talked through the prayer, talked through the baptism, talked well into the sermon.  And in the rare moments when they actually listened to the sermon, one of those behind us would laugh loudly at the pastor's jokes, so loudly that we'd miss the next sentence or two. I warred with myself inside: should I turn and stare meaningfully at them?  Speak up?  Shush them?I'd seriously considered moving.  There were empty seats ahead of us and empty seats to the side of us.  But even as I thought of these possible moves, those places filled.  I felt I was just stuck and I began to seethe inside.I have a hearing problem.  It doesn't require hearing aids but one ear has a 50% hearing loss.  If there are two competing sounds going on (like two conversations) I generally miss the one that is deepest toned or farther from me, while being far too aware of the nearest conversation or higher pitched sounds.  This day, all I could hear were the two voices behind me.In my home this week......We have worked hard this past week.  I don't know what is upon us, but a definite determination to let go of things has hit us.  Mind you, I've about got such notions out of my system now and the house feels tons lighter due to it, but this week the bug bit John.  He hauled boxes and bags of things from the music room and music room closet, both of which are solely his province.  If the house felt lighter with my work, I promise you I heard the house give a great huge sigh as John's work progressed.  No need to ask if we're done yet, because we're not!I finished up all I meant to do to in the laundry, back entry and kitchen this past week.  What I've left behind me are prettier, neater, less cluttered spaces.  It makes me feel good to walk into those areas. This next week I shall begin the same deep cleaning of another space.  I think it will be ever so slightly easier this go round as I'll no longer be deep in boot camp.  I'm graduated as of Friday at sundown!"},
{"title": "Frugal Friday:  You're In the Army Now...", "date": null, "text": "The most definitely not photo shopped but oh so good Tamar Adler inspired soup of leftovers.  It was delicious and  made enough for two meals for me.Saturday:  Katie brought us a handful of vegetables from her little garden.  Two Roma tomatoes, two cucumbers, a squash and a beautiful jalapeno pepper.  I sliced the tomatoes and a cucumber, cooked the squash and served those items with our dinner today.  Katie also brought me a small baggie of Coke caps so I can enter the codes into MCR site.I took the leftover tomato slices and put them in with the leftover green beans and potatoes to make soup tomorrow.I prepared and pre-packed the non-perishable parts of John's work lunch for tomorrow.I saved coffee grounds, peelings and paper towels we used through out the day and added to the compost heap.I watered plants using water I'd stored.  I tossed this particular bottle as it was another of the round ones.  I can fit six flat bottles in the same space that five rounds one fit.Sent Katie home with a truck load of stuff gathered from the shed.  I won't have to donate it and I know it's all going to be used and loved in her home.   One thing that made me super happy was that she immediately spied the twin headboard I'd trash picked.  It has really good bones and I was hopeful she'd like it for Taylor's room when she moves up from the crib.  She did like it and took it home with her.  I can't wait to see how she transforms it but that will be a little while yet.I first purchased this book when it was published in 1997.  I cannot imagine not having space on my bookshelf for this lovely book.And there's good reason why I chose to end my boot camp with this book.Tracey McBride elevates frugality.  It's not about being cheap or miserly.  It is about living well, savoring the good things, learning to make the very best out of the lesser things and moving gently through life to a rhythm that is different from that of the world at large.  It is because of Tracey that I began to keep a gratitude journal after I left my last job and money was so very, very tight.  Every night I wrote out five things I was grateful for and I found that often enough, the things that had meant the most during the day had little to do with cash flow and a great deal more to do with appreciation.  It amuses me no end that at times I wrote out the menu for the day.  Amazingly the ones most appreciated and which tasted the best were also the most economical ones, but they were seasonal and delicious.  While I understood the rudiments of a frugal life (which Tracey beautifully explains with quotes from well loved authors and clearly written explanations), I had not gained the 'better life' ideals.  I learned these from Tracey.  Not only how to better manage our income but how to graciously ask for help (calling debtors and creditors if we were unable to make a payment),  how to enhance what we had (using herbs and wine or fruit juice and vinegar to create the subtle quality of wine in a dish), and how to expand a wardrobe (purchase only items that will go with at least five other pieces in your current wardrobe) among many other tips and helps.  The final chapters under Shelter are probably the most lovely chapters of the book.  It is through these chapters I learned to scout thrift and yard sales to look for beautiful pieces to bless our home and enhance our lives.Beauty in frugality is a rare thing.  It's a delicate balance of not only stretching the dollar but making sure that the stretching of it is both gracious and life enhancing.  I know this from experience now, but I learned of it first from Tracey.I get hard focused sometimes on 'making do' but ultimately I want to live well, in a genteel way, if you will.  While I might well be focusing on 26 ways to stretch my grocery dollar, I want above all for the people who sit down to my table to never guess that the meal was merely a means to stretch a dollar.  I want them to gain a wonderful memory of a meal eaten with good people, in a home filled with peace and joy and lovely things."},

Over the years I've come to appreciate what she has to offer.  http://www.theprudenthomemaker.com/blog/  Brandy has a lovely blog.  She is a talented gardener as well as photographer and she too has seen the hard times and lived to tell the tale.  She is such a gracious spirit and truly does her best to make things beautiful.  Her blog is fairly 'new' yet but she has a world of information and such on her website so explore it fully.http://gdonna.com/  Sarah mentioned this blog to me about a year ago I think.  I let it go unnoticed for a  bit but after her second mention of it I went and then another reader mentioning her to me, I went ahead and checked it out.  It's such a charming old fashioned sort of blog and interesting as can be.  It's full of good solid thrift.  http://atrayofbliss.blogspot.com/  I discovered Mimi's blog about the time I did Annabel's.  I've only recently gone back to read her archived material.  It's a blog full of gems...which suits Mimi's sparkling style.Now there are many more I read, but I don't have time or room to share them all.  However, if you'll start with these few and read some of those featured on their bloglists, you'll soon have a world of new bloggers to boost your frugal fitness.P.S.   Sarah mentioned in comments about Laine's letters.  How could I possibly forget?  I've got that link in my favorites list as well!  And yes, she was very influential in my early frugal years of homemaking!http://web.archive.org/web/20040609142553/http://lainesletters.com/letters.html"},

{"title": "Questions, Answers and Comments, Oh My!", "date": null, "text": "Since the bulk of the past month has been all about Frugal Boot Camp,  I am going to address comments chronologically starting with the first post of the month and working my way through to the last post.  I won't be highlighting individual post this month.I mentioned saving dishwater to water plants rather than running extra water.  Sarah reminded me that Granny and Grandmama both had two dishpans, one for washing, one for rinsing.  I do remember them both taking those dishpans outdoors and dumping that water on the flowers outdoors.  Sarah wisely suggests pouring the water into a bucket to take outdoors.Saving water was a hot topic during this first post. Gramma D asked me if I'd been told \"If it's yellow let it mellow...\" No, we weren't.  Granny had an outhouse (and for a short time during my growing years so did we.), but that was one area of 'savings' we didn't use.  Both Sarah and Gramma D mentioned Joanna York.  I vaguely recall reading her articles in women's magazines.  I did a search to see if anything came up but I didn't find a thing about her.  I was sure she'd written a book or two but I'll have to look a bit harder to find that.We were sitting in the kitchen talking the other day when a strange car pulled into the yard.  The man in the car drove around and looked hard at our new shed and then pulled up to the porch and stopped.  It seems when the delivery truck brought the shed last Monday they stopped first at his place.  He sent them on, but was intrigued.  He'd come to see the shed up close.  Now honestly, I was a little put out.  This is not at all the usual around our home!John went straight to the door and spoke with the man.  They walked about and looked at the sheds and came back to stand in front of the back porch.  He and John talked a good little while and John took him out to the new shed so the man could examine it more closely.  This man was interested in purchasing a shed for his property.  John smiled when he came indoors, a little of it relief.  To come up to our house takes a bit of boldness.  People don't generally show up here except on purpose. We don't live on a main road and you have to drive about a quarter mile into the property to get to the house.  You don't just wander by our place.  However, it helped to discover this man is actually a neighbor.  He lives up the road from us and like our place his is off the road, just not as well hidden as we are."},

Fisher's How to Cook a Wolf,  that the most readable of cookbook authors have known what it is to have little food, but know too that little food is always the making of a feast if it is approached with the right mindset.  Adler is a proponent of using all of something, be it vegetable, fruit or innards of an animal that many people find repellant.  She reminds me that there was a day and a time when, as an elderly relative once put it, \"We ate all the pig, except the 'oink'.\"  It was considered wasteful to do otherwise.And so I find myself determined to be yet more economical in my kitchen.  I've saved bones for broth and ends of onions and carrots and celery for broth making.  I've saved peels and cores of apples for making jelly.  I save ends of bread loaves and last bits of cornbread in the freezer.  And to what purpose?  So that I can make the dog pup Popsicles from the broth we don't eat or toss the bones because it's taking up room I deem more valuable for 'real food' and ditto for the apple peels and cores.  My sole saving is that I do indeed use the bread pieces for strata, French toast and croutons.  It's not enough.  For all of my 'zero waste' mentality and determination to use it up there are many things yet that might be used in this kitchen.Yummy fried green tomatoes were on the menu last week...I do love them but the silly green tomatoes cost more than ripe ones if you must purchase.   Oddly when you grow your own they all cost the same... Thanks to Mama who provided this one for us.Saturday:  Today marks the beginning of week five of boot camp. Two more weeks to go and honestly I'm tired but I'm pushing forward.  This is for my own good...Turned of ceiling fans and fans before leaving home today.Packed bottles of water and packets of crackers for snacks on the road.Remember my plans to save $20 a week?  I said I'd save all my fives to cover that and this week I put $35 in my savings from my pocket money.  That's only $5 more needed to cover next week's $20 as well.  It means I have a lot less pocket money than I'd planned but I am very serious about saving the $20 to fund other home projects.I also set $40 aside in our account, which will cover two weeks. That will be vacation funds! It may not always be possible to put that much aside but I'm going to do what I can.  Nothing saved, nothing gained, right?I received my free bra today.  It's a nice bra.  I plan to wear it a few times and see how it feels but if it's as comfortable as it feels at the moment, I plan to order some of these.  I'll share details later.  I've already looked up where to buy and costs.  It's very reasonable while on sale.Sunday:  We had to refill the car today after our trip yesterday.  I have money set aside for gas for trips and we'll use that to cover this expense.John and I went into Publix.  I'd meant to buy a 12 pack of canned drinks but 6 packs of bottles were $1 less, with $1off coupons on them and were also buy one get one.  Obviously a much better purchase.Stuck to my list while in the store.  My only 'splurge' was to get a packet of buns to make the sandwiches for our dinner today.Purchased a Sunday paper.  And picked up the Publix coupon flyers while we were in the store, too.I haven't been feeling well, so we kept meals very simple.  I picked up deli roasted turkey and we had sandwiches from that.  Not something I'd normally do but necessary today."},
{"title": "Iced Tea Chat: Glistening Weather", "date": null, "text": "Hello dears, do come in from the heat and sit here near the fan.  I've lemons, limes, and plenty of tea and ice to cool us down a bit as we chat.Let's not discuss the weather over much.  Let's agree that it is perfectly seasonal and now that August is looming just days away, it's exactly what it ought to be and so we'll leave it at that.Let's don't discuss politics or the world at large either at the moment.  Respite is needed.I think the lovely young woman above looks very cool and collected don't you?  But the neckline of her dress bothers me no end.  It doesn't look quite comfortable.  I'm afraid were it me, I'd be agitated and tugging at that bit that stretched across my throat.  I wonder how it would look to unbutton the top two buttons and lay it across the bodice there in a sort of flap.  Still perfectly modest, but not quite so strangling.   It would be quite pretty with a print of some sort on the reverse, even if it were a white on white pattern... Well never mind...that is the way my brain works these days.Do take note of that vase next to her.  It might be copper.  I like the warmth of copper.  It was very popular in that particular era of time.  Well honey, you too can indulge in copper as it's fully on display at Hobby Lobby at present.  Apparently it is 'in' once more, which just goes to show that if you hold on to things they will indeed come around once again.   It was really lovely to see that warm metal displayed, so much warmer than brass or silver and not quite as pretentious as gold sometimes seems.  Copper just has a sort of  glowing look to it, even when as elegantly styled as that vase there.  And just see how the chrysanthemums seem to embrace the warmth of  the color!  See how lovely both pink and deep yellow are with it?  Which is rather nice together by the way, pink and copper.  I have a sort of copper colored lipstick that Katie chose for me years ago, Kasbah from Rimmel,  which I generally wear in summer.  Yesterday when we came back home, I changed into a pink t-shirt and happened to glance some time later in the mirror.  I was still wearing my lipstick and I saw how really well the two colors complemented each other.  I hadn't realized how much pink was in that color as well as the copper.The Supermarket Survival Manual  by Judy Lynn Kemp is a great book.   I cannot find an image online and my copy is too brittle to even think of scanning.  However, the book is still available on Amazon for a mere $3.  Written in 1973, this book is every bit as relevant as it was the date it was published.  And here's a hint ladies...You know how I love vintage women's magazines.  I prefer those written in the 1940's and early '50's but there is a world of good info in those books published in the 1970's.  I remember the 'cough' not depression we had back then, too and started married life in that era.  These ladies (and men) knew their cost cutting stuff through experience so don't think the 1970's homemakers didn't know their cost cutting tricks.  My copy was sent to me some years ago and I've thumbed through it enough to almost wear it out.  This book starts out with good information in the INTRODUCTION;  you gotta love that.  For instance, did you know that you don't need to purchase the top of the pineapple if you're paying per pound?  That any grade of egg works as well as another?  I am sure there was a day and time when eggs differed but if you're scrambling them what's the difference?  I love this bit of wisdom:  Look at the eggs you buy.  Roll your open hand over them.  Broken eggs will show up...Let the market make the omelet...Get a good dozen."},

I took notes and will share in my next Frugal Boot Camp post.Looked at Pinterest boards to see how I might wear my black maxi skirt.  Honestly with the ideas I'd already saved and the ideas I found today I could wear that outfit every day for nearly two weeks and just change up the accessories, change the shirt, etc.  Ordered a nightie today, much needed.  That gift I mentioned receiving is funding this purchase."},

{"title": "Frugal Boot Campe:  How To Cook A Wolf by M.F.K. Fisher", "date": null, "text": "It seems as though I've heard of this book forever and ever.  I finally broke down and ordered it after it proved utterly elusive on any thrift store or even library shelf.  Originally published in 1942 during WWII and rationing, Ms. Fisher updated the book in 1988 with additional notes included in parenthesis.   This is the copy I own, a 1988 copy.  Prices on Amazon range from under $3 to upwards of $50.  Pick and choose and get a decent copy that will last you a while.  It's a darned good read and not just a cookbook.  In fact, it's more good read than cookbook though there are recipes included.Fisher wrote this book during world war bombing blitzes and ration coupons and food shortages.  Her title refers to the wolf at the door.  Practically she suggests that when the wolf is at the door you invite him in and make dinner of him.  And then she goes on to highlight various international recipes that can adapt to a bevy of substitutions and still be good food.  She suggests that nutrition be balanced daily overall and to skip the rather illogical practice of trying to balance each meal.  As she rightly points out quite often we don't want a fully balanced meal starting with breakfast.  In her estimation the day should start out with a pot of hot coffee and a platter of hot toast which one would eat with butter if it's to be had and jam and have all you want.  While lunch might well be soup and a salad (encompassing most of the day's vegetable requirements) followed by fresh fruit and supper be a light meal of meat and potato and dessert if you must."},
{"title": "Frugal Boot Camp:  The I Hate to Housekeep Book by Peg Bracken", "date": null, "text": "The I Hate to Housekeep Book by Peg Bracken, written circa 1960 or so, is available on Amazon, Ebay, and at Alibris and even on Etsy.  Prices range from $1.22 (Alibris) to $44 (Etsy for a signed first edition copy).  There is no shortage of this book;  it's available just every where online and likely no shortage at any good thrift store either.  I purchased my own copy at a thrift store for under $1.Though written in a very tongue in cheek sort of way, make no mistake, Peg Bracken knows her stuff.  She starts right away in Chapter One with absolutely practical advice:  Don't cover things up!  As she points out we have tile in our kitchen so that we can easily clean spills...so why are we tossing a rug down in front of the stove and sink?  That one made me stop and think a moment.  I realized I do it because I like the softness it adds to an otherwise hard room that tends to echo sounds.  I always buy the sort that I can toss in the washer though.  That's just the tip of the ice berg of practical home cleaning advice.  She goes on to suggest these things in Chapter one:Keep pots and pans out of sight.  Hanging pots and pans adds to visual clutter...and you'll be obligated to keep them super spic and span otherwise they are an eyesore.Each time you give the house a good deep cleaning start in a different room.  She surmises (rightly!) that we often run out of steam before we are done and if we start at a different point each time we're bound to eventually get the whole house clean.Act immediately on housewifely impulses.  Soap, water and a sponge now accomplishes more than putting off a task until you have a special cleanser or tool meant just for that task.  How right she is on this one!  Soap, water and a sponge did more for the railings of the front porch than waiting two years for paint could ever do!"},
{"title": "Frugal Boot Camp:  The Complete Book Of Home Management", "date": null, "text": "The Complete Book of Home Management by Elva Anson and Kathie Liden.  This book is available on Amazon for $.01-$10.  I found two copies on eBay for $4.50 and $4.99.I'm not sure just where I acquired this book but it was on my bookshelf.  This is one of three books I've read over the weekend.  It wasn't a hard read.  It's a decent book, probably more suited to those who are actively parenting but not a bad book to refresh thinking.  I'm going to pass this one on to one of the younger girls in my family, I think.The book has good practical information.  Originally published as The Compleat Family Book ( still available on Amazon and eBay for under $4)  in 1960 and being reprinted several times, the information in it is not dated.  It's all good practical advice.The book begins with the supposition that you want to change your family and home.  It's a Christian based book and there are several references to scripture and putting God first in your life, your marriage, your family and home. As you all know by now, I whole heartedly agree with that! The first chapter introduces the idea that change can be had if one is willing to adjust attitude and thinking, words and actions.  The authors suggest half steps to goals.  One of my favorite lines in this chapter reminds that even if you move two steps forward and one step back, you're still making progress.   This moderate approach is repeated all through the other chapters, as well."},
{"title": "Weekend Reading", "date": null, "text": "I've been saving up some posts over the last few weeks that I thought you all might enjoy as much as I have.  We'll start with the two freshest and work our way down the list I'd saved.Dee wrote this week about the Housedress...I really enjoyed this post and was inspired to order four dresses for myself as 'at home' wear.MSN had this slideshow over the weekend.  I loved looking at it and since we're going retro here anyway with housedresses, why not see what travel was like in yesteryear?I stumbled upon this article about these 'crystal caves'.  Having visited Ruby Falls and seen some of these caves in nature series I am familiar with the idea, but these are truly spectacular.Coloring being very popular for adults just now, I've got this on my wish list.I thought the renovation on this home was intriguing, since they made it as it was when built in 1960.  The whole site is a fun one to read through.I recall my first reading of the scripture referred to in this post and it struck me hard.  Loved this post!This little recipe blog has been hanging about in the blogsphere for a good many years now, neglected and dusty and with a whole 11 followers.  I'm slowly getting it up and running and over time I'll even organize it a bit better but for now, here it is, debuting as a companion to this blog.  https://bluehousejournalrecipes.blogspot.com/I'll continue to add recipes as I have time to work on older posts from here and the old Penny Ann Poundwise blog.  I hope you all enjoy this added resource.This week in my home, I:...have another busy week planned.  I worked steadily all last week and knocked out a number of the items on my July Goals.  Not all of them complete but nearly every one of them started upon in some way and many of them are complete.  I shared a lot of that in my Frugal Friday post.  It's amazing how work can be economical...How so?Well stop and think about it now.  Work generally involves building, repairing, maintaining or creating doesn't it?  I do all of those things in some form in my home six days a week.  Even if I'm not hard at work on the house or wardrobe or yard, there's this blog to keep up.  Most all of the work, except the blog, is all about saving money for this household.  Hence my statement that work is economical.   As one enlightened young woman put it to me one time, \"Saving money takes a LOT of effort.\"  Yup.  That's called WORK.I happen to like work.  I think it makes life interesting.  I like to read, too, and listen to music, and sit on the porch and do nothing.  It's striking the right balance that makes it all pleasant as can be.  Boredom rarely sets in if you have the mix just right, nor exhaustion, either.  Besides work is good for what ails you...It got me through the week without missing that little boy too much.  How gratified I felt when he asked for me the other morning, so Bess called.  Josh took the phone and ran away.  I know, because I could hear him shaking the phone as he ran but he talked to me the whole while.  He reported the cats were 'Fine' and that the house was a house.  Beyond that it was just so much jabber but it was a start to a conversation and one I enjoyed.  I started the closing of my booth this week.  I'm paid up through the end of July and I decided to cull a few things, put up a sign advertising everything 50% off.  I'll go about this slowly, clearing out a little each week,  thinking hard about whether to donate or keep for a bit, but not leaving myself a ton of work at month's end.  I found myself not in the least sad about shutting down the booth but philosophical.  It was a season and I enjoyed it.  Now it's time to move on, to let go so that I can be ready for the next opportunity to come my way."},
{"title": "Frugal Friday: Hup Hup Hup...Boot Camp Continues", "date": null, "text": "A few years ago I purchased sturdy cotton duck slipcovers for two of my chairs and I've not one whit of regret over that expense.  But I also purchased at the time an ottoman cover.  Having seen how simple it was in construction I regretted spending the money.  It cost nearly as much as one of the chair slipcovers had...So making up my mind this past winter to change the color of the slipcover on the ottoman, I knew I would make it myself.  I used an old cotton flat bed sheet and the former slipcover as my pattern.  I had all I needed on hand to make this cover and so it cost me nothing but a couple of hours time.  No regrets...Saturday:  I'm short on bread and there was just one bagel.  Bess prefers a bagel for breakfast so we left that to her.  I made scones, which are a richer biscuit dough.  They were mighty good.  The baking powder I've been using up was dated expired in January of this year.  It's just fine, still raises dough but it's got hard and clumpy.  I find that sifting it makes it work better.  Lesson here is that just because it says it's beyond 'best' date doesn't mean you can't still use it.We did both laundry and dishes this morning, a full load of each.  I filled the empty spots of the dishwasher with the coffee pot and sink stoppers and such.I made John and I a scratched together lunch of leftovers from the freezer.  It wasn't particularly tasty but it filled the empty spots in us and that food won't be wasted or forgotten.Baked a lovely peach cobbler this morning and put it in the oven while I was roasting a chicken for supper."},

{"title": "Iced Tea Chat:  Wilting In The Shade", "date": null, "text": "Hello dears, hello...I've been 'restraining' myself these past few days from doing too much, so I've written any number of posts, read any number of chapters and worked hard in spells.  But I shall not even faintly suggest we sit on the porch or patio.  There's not enough ice in all of town to make it in the least a consideration.  July has decided to be HOT and no mistake about it.  I dried two full loads of clothes on the line yesterday in half a day's time and had I planned better and been less considerate of my energy, I might easily have washed and hung to dry two more and got them in before afternoon.The 'kids',  as we call them, went to their home on Sunday.   John was at work and Samuel considers that a prime time for leave taking and has since his Navy days.  John, you see, is a bit of a weepy fellow when it comes to seeing the children off no matter how old they get nor how short the time between visits.  Samuel is a bit of a sentimentalist himself and John always proves to be his undoing.  So they left on Sunday, one of John's work days this week.I had, by the end of last week, reconciled myself to how much I'd miss them and had  begun to think how pleasant it would be to have my home all to myself for a few hours and anticipated the return of a few routines which had been set aside with extra folks in the house. That is not to say I too couldn't get sentimental.   I ENJOYED having someone in the house 24/7 and I mean that sincerely.  I had a few teary moments with Bess and was waxing poetic with Josh a bit later but that boy is no nonsense.  He looked at me with his brown eyes and smiled sweetly and said \"Bye!\" in the midst of the poetic moment and walked away.  Put a damper on my sentimental mood for a bit there...Yes, living with others does tend to point up their faults but thankfully I found that I just plain LIKE my family and their faults are few and minor and not worth complaining over.   I'm very hopeful the same is being said of me in the other house tonight. I found it rather daunting that one little boy could run down two grown women by day's end and make them rather glad to see their own beds once he was settled in his.  And he isn't even a child who requires lots of minding, unlike his daddy who was best described as a handful by most and warranted the observation from my Grandmama, \"Really, Terri.  I do think that child just needs a pill of some sort...\" lol.  Josh wasn't hyperactive, or messy or demanding much as a rule.  But molars are no picnic for a two year old boy and he let us know as much.  Young mamas the world over should get a deal less criticism from us older women once we've walked a mile in their shoes and remember from whence we came while raising our own toddlers."},
{"title": "Frugal Boot Camp: Orchids on Your Budget, cont'd...", "date": null, "text": "Chapter 5: Things You Can't Afford (cont'd)So when last I left off, I shared questions from the last of this chapter.  Today I will provide answers.  I didn't copy the answers word for word in every case but the gist of what Miss Hillis said in her explanations is very similar.  I add my own observations in italics.#1.   Yes  The unstylish friends would likely be uncomfortable in too fine a place and might think you were showing off, especially if you can't afford to.  Choose one where the atmosphere is not too dowdy but the food is good.  My son points out that in his business whether you are higher or lower in the supervisory chain they all use the same sorts of restaurants.  There is a silent but mutual agreement that everyone will order a median priced plate of their choice and nothing extravagant.  It's understood that for the men who are not salaried this is a treat and for the men who are supervisors this is good economy.  So there is that to consider as well, I think.#2.  No  The fact that a friend has a car doesn't make it convenient for them to carry you about.  It's sponging...and I reckon this expands to any other form of sponging whether it's using electronics or borrowing clothes, etc.#3. Yes  What you save not buying a paper doesn't begin to pay for the irritation most people feel in having to share theirs.  If someone is kind enough to share then by all means accept but make it the sort of kindness you pass on.  Mama passes along her gently read magazines.  I pass them on to Katie who passes them on to her mother in law.  #4.  No  Getting your shoes wet is extravagant and foolish, as they seldom look the same and keeping other people waiting is rude.  Not sure anyone walks anymore, at least not in the towns I'm near but I thought the bit about keeping people waiting because you choose to economize is a point we should be mindful of.  Tardiness is rude.  Period.#5.  No  If you do this at all, you are pretty sure to do it too often and one fine day will find that the new dress isn't so new or so smart and you've had scarcely any use of it.  I found among Grandmama's things many a fine classic dress and like new shoes that were never worn and others that were nearly thread bare she'd worn them so much.  Ditto for towels and linens.  Frankly I couldn't help but think what a waste of money it had been to purchase them.#8.  No  You probably won't have them made over and someone who needs them could be wearing them and getting the pleasure of having them.  Not too long ago I was offered a pants suit with tags on that had been lingering in a closet.  It was deemed 'too good to donate and to nice to give to just anyone.'  I wasn't flattered by the gift as the suit was so outdated that I'd had to turn back the clock 20 years for it to be in current fashion.  I couldn't help but think what a blessing it might have been to someone who really could have used it...twenty years ago!  Besides this borders on hoarding..."},
{"title": "Frugal Bootcamp:  Orchids On Your Budget by Marjorie Hillis, Part 1", "date": null, "text": "I first read this book when I found it on the shelves of the library I patronized at the time and I found a copy of it at an estate sale I think (or perhaps in a thrift store) a few years ago and snatched it up.  It was, honestly the first book on my thrift shelf where I keep all my money saving books, and so I took it up this week and decided I should start my Frugal Boot Camp with inspirations drawn from the book.  I'm going to break the book down into a chapter by chapter review, I think because it's full of good advice overall though one or three areas might well do better with a more sensible approach.  Nonetheless, I'll take the gems and leave behind the dross.Miss Hillis wrote for Vogue magazine throughout the depression years and continued to write under her married name both as an author and co-author (Marjorie Hillis Roulston).  While the primary focus was the single woman (whether by choice, or being widowed or divorced), her focus was enjoying the life you have, but not being limited to a strict budget with no frills.  Her theory was that any budget could be adjusted to fit your needs and a few of your wants and that naturally if you really wanted a few of those wants you'd happily adjust your budget to afford them.  In this, I think she was very smart and her ideal is still applicable today.The overall tone of this book is cheerful and almost, but not quite, frivolous.  I recall hearing that movie studios really dolled up their stars during the depression in an effort to make audiences feel not every one was having a hard time and good days were ahead yet.  A sort of reverse psychology optimism  that those who didn't have it (it being a grand old time) would have it if they just kept their chins up.  And indeed who wanted to go to the movies to forget their troubles and see lives similar to their own upon the screen?  I think this is more or less the same point of view that Miss Hillis tried to impart in her book.  In  Orchids On Your Budget, Miss Hillis ends each chapter with several 'case study' illustrations of various women who prove her point.  I won't share her case studies but I may add a few of my own  views.  I think, if you can find the book through library or by purchasing, that you'll find the  information is not really out of date even these many years after publication and it truly is a good read.  There are a few copies on eBay from $8 - $25 and Amazon has listings ranging from $3 to $26.  You might also look for copies of Bubbly on Your Budget which seemingly is the same book reissued with a new title.  My own copy of  is a first edition I found  at a thrift store for under $2...So jot it down on your book list if you're interested in seeking it out.Chapter 1:  Well Who Isn't Poor?Written in the Depression years, her opening question was quite poignant.  Nearly everyone suffered a financial loss and nearly every one was having to downgrade their living in one form or another at the time.   The U.S. has been through a few economic slumps since then (the most recent being the one most decried as not being one and whose effects we are all still reeling from).  Altered financial circumstances happen and we adjust our lives accordingly.  Miss Hillis rightly points out that anyone who is struggling to pay their bills or who has to forgo the simplest of wants is having a financial struggle.  She advises that anyone might plan to have some of what they want or plan to go without!  My favorite quote from this section is:  \"Planning about possibilities and dreaming about improbabilities are not the same thing.\"  I've had a wonderful time in June, but it's meant fewer posts than usual.  However, you've all been good to comment.  Most were congratulations on getting to see grandchildren, understanding my necessity for alone time (short short supply this past month, lol) and how much you enjoy your own grandchildren.Karla posed a question:  You have mentioned previously that you now store your berries in jars. Would you elaborate on how you prep them once you bring them home from the grocery?I had read of storing lemons and limes in a glass jar of water in the fridge to prevent them drying out so quickly and that worked very well.  I happened to stumble upon a Pin on Pinterest for making berries last longer.  You bring them home from the store, remove from the plastic clam shell and store them in a covered glass jar in the fridge.  You do not wash them until you mean to use them.  I'll say that I get at least 5-7 days more to use berries over my previous method of leaving in the clam shell pack in the fridge.  It's been nice to have berries last so much longer.  Just wash right before using and never wash more than you mean to use right away.Lana Congratulations on your 38th anniversary.  May you have many more happy years together!Gramma D, I must sincerely tell you that never in all my years of 100f+ temperatures have I lost weight...Sad but true, lol.  We are slated for 102f and 103f this week.  I shall have to be very mindful of watering plants and watching that shades and curtains are drawn to preserve the cool air indoors.Debbie, Josh is like most folks I guess.  Two or three days of eating bagels and he's done and on to something else.  I think his Mama gets a bit frustrated but I've found that he eats well when he's truly hungry and picks and shakes his head 'No' at everything when he's not.In my home this week:  ...I keep hearing the song \"The party's over now...\" in my brain this morning.  Well, this party may be over but seasons generally go on a smidge longer.  I'm just assuming there's more to it and I'm getting a breathing space between rounds.  That's just fine by me, because I need that breathing space.  If you've read my July goals list you'll know I've plenty to keep me busy this month.  In addition we've got three social events already on the calendar for July.  John has a ten day stretch off at the end of the month...Yes, I expect this season isn't over but simply giving us a lull and that's quite all right.  I could use a lull along about now to catch up on some of the many things I'm behind on.So yes, my family has moved on into their new home, 'roughing it' as they say until their furniture arrives on Wednesday.  They have a blow up mattress, a pack and play and I suppose they will purchase a couple of outdoor chairs to use indoors until the furnishings arrive...I would.  In other news, my next youngest granddaughter celebrated her second birthday with her family.  The youngest one took her first steps this week, ignoring the hand reached out to assist her.  My eldest son is in Hawaii, such a hard duty that one has for his sea duty.  Mama is slowly moving things into her new abode, a mother in law suite that my brother built into his home especially for her.  It seems, as one of John's songs goes, \"Everybody's moving....\", if not in fact, then in theory.  And peach season began...Well, cling free peach season began and I'm enjoying it!  Yum!Moving in my house this week will take the form of getting busy cleaning all those neglected areas and shifting things about, in and out.  I had a call from the flea market just before the weekend and was asked if I'd like to resign my space.  I made nothing again this past month and it's obvious to the owner as well as to myself that this venture of mine is at a clear end.  I've given my verbal notice and allotted myself plenty of time to move things out a bit at a time.  I'll go in this week and start the process.   Today...well I'm under strict orders from John to not work myself \"into a heap but to leave a few things for the rest of the week\".  Obviously he's not seen my list of July goals, ha.And regardless of how easy I might take it, there are still plans to be made for the week ahead, right?"},

I also have a pressure cooker and an ice cream maker, neither of which I've ever used at all!  Time to figure out how to use these servants as well, or plan to pass them on to others who might use them.John washed two full loads of laundry.  He hung most all of them to dry.  It took less than an hour outdoors to fully dry the comforter that goes in the bottom of Josh's pack and play bed.  I like the solar powered 'dryer' best of all, lol."},
{"title": "July Goals", "date": null, "text": "Hello all.  I've been doing a world of thinking these last two weeks and with May and June pretty much having flown past and very little accomplished over the last 8 weeks, I thought I'd try and make July count HARD.  I have three social/visits already on the calendar for July, too. I'd love to think that all of life is summer and like the photo above but I need to do a lot of work about here.  It might well prove to be a busy month.  There are nevertheless things I MUST do this month and I thought I'd like to add another thing or two just because, you know, I might not have enough to do...#1.  Frugal Boot Camp started last week of June.  Why?  Because I need it just now.  I have this feeling I need to refresh my knowledge, find new ways and means to save.  Typically July is always a sticky sort of month and I don't mean because of the heat, which by the way is meant to be in the 100f range.  It always feels as though we have a slow down in the income, an increase in the outgo and enough wants/needs besides to frustrate.  I'll be reviewing several books from my bookshelves.  So all throughout July I'll continue to read and look for methods I have forgotten or need to now employ.#2.  Really clean up the guest room and work hard on finding solutions to several problems I've noted over the past visits.   Naturally, the bulk of my work in that space will be 'Use what you have' generated.#3.  Sort out the pantry/little freezer.  I've offered the smaller of the freezers to Katie.  I need to clear the pantry shelves so I can move them to move the freezer and then put the pantry stuff back.  Not a short job.  In this case I need to clean the guest room in order to have space to put things and be able to move the freezer out of the room.  BIG fruit basket turnover scenario...#4.  Give notice at the flea market and clear that space...another fruit basket turnover situation.  I need to move some things meant for donation from the shed so that I can move stuff from the flea market into the shed.  Bonus:  I've two sets of shelves I can use in either the pantry area or the shed or both spaces.#5.  Get my house back into shape.  It's not horrid, but it's looking careworn and is suffering from minor neglect.  I'd love to do a whole deep clean thing but I know too well with all my other plans I don't have enough time nor energy to do that this month.  I will get it back to neat and orderly though.#6.  Shopping:  I need some things for my wardrobe.  I don't have shorts or lightweight pants or skirts I can wear about the house, nor do I have decent t-shirts.  I'm so over looking in the mirror and grimacing and tired of panicking at state of my clothing when the UPS man or the mail lady comes up unexpectedly.  It is a rare bit of clothing that doesn't have stains or paint on them or that isn't miles too large.  I don't have anything in my closet that can filter down to fill this gap.  I'm saving my allowance diligently in order to meet this and a few other clothing needs.  Other items on my list: robes (lightweight summer, heavier one for winter and I am up to sewing these if necessary).  Pajamas and nighties.  Fresh summer tops are needed as well.   My spring ones looked nice, but were just not fitting me well.   They did fit Bess perfectly.#7. Get my pantry and freezer restocked.  I'll work on this slowly.  I've noted that Patsy at A Working Pantry and Brenda at Coffee, Tea, Books and Me both mention the challenge of slowly building pantries with low cash amounts.  I thought I'd like to give myself an allowance of $20 per pay period to start with.  I'll make a list, watch for sales and try my best to get big bang for small bucks.#8.  June was a heavy month for grocery spending.  I was over budget and why shouldn't I have been?  While Bess and Sam helped out, we also had four family gatherings during the month.  I'd like to be below normal budget amount this month.  I've thought seriously about this and think I'm going to try to spend $50/week this month, which must include any cleaning, food, pet, and paper supplies needed.  I'll allow the $10/week for restocking (total of $60/week).  #9.  Further my Diabetes Education.  I told myself last year that I needed a break and to do things slowly.  I concentrated hard on the basics: losing a few pounds, learning to balance carbs and lowering my blood sugar numbers.  My numbers are very good and I've maintained my weight loss.  I've had a few questions through out the year but reminded myself that I was focused on just those three areas and I stuck to that.  Now I'm ready to educate myself a little further, perhaps lose a few more pounds and learn more about what my body really needs in order to be healthy.  I've been collecting two different Diabetic magazines over the past year and I've pulled a few articles here and there.  I want to read and study and decide what my next focus areas will be for the coming year.#10.  Blog.  I have several ideas for extra posts and of course, I hope to have more ideas as I do my budgetary work, study, boot camp, etc.  And I think that is quite enough planned for July, don't you?  What I'm not adding in is working in the yard but if a few early mornings prove to be pleasant enough to allow it I might well do a few tasks over and above watering plants.  Ideally, I'd find a substitute plant for the petunias that are suffering in the full sun and heat.  I'd also organize the shed, read a few hundred books, cook up a few new recipes, etc. etc.  I know myself well.  I'll be busy aplenty without adding any of those tasks!What do you have planned for July?"},
{"title": "In My Home This Week:  Summer Daze", "date": null, "text": "This week in my home... ...It was a quieter week than we've had in the week's just past.  The big news this week was getting the kitty out from under the back porch where she'd hidden herself for four days.  We got water and food bowls set up for her until we could concentrate on removing her to the pet crate.  This is one of Bess' cats that managed to escape last week when she picked them up from kennel.  Violet is now at home with the rest of the kitties.  They moved her there yesterday.  Bittersweet.  That's what this past week has been and I expect this week will be also...It's the last week with the family here.I'm torn, truly I am.  On Saturday the kids went down to spend time at the new home, albeit the empty home.  John and I whisked around and moved furniture and vacuumed deeply and cleared up toys and the house looked neat and pretty.  I realized I've missed the orderliness of my home, though it's hardly been a mess.  I suspect I shall also miss the clutter and the cars on the kitchen counter (Josh can just reach them now and is constantly pushing cars up on them).  I shall relish the peace and quiet and miss the mayhem and noise.  I'll enjoy being alone and miss having ready company.  It's always so isn't it?  Can't have this without losing that, can't have that without losing this...One more week......we plan meals:"},
{"title": "Iced Tea Chat:  The Eyes of the Beholder", "date": null, "text": "So come on in, but please be very quiet...It seems every one but myself is taking a nap.  And that's just fine by me because it means I have a few moments to be myself and not 'Gah' or \"Mama\" or homemaker, housekeeper, cook and chief bottle washer.  I think, really, I've almost forgotten who 'Terri' is these past few weeks.  Just ignore the state of the house.  Despite all the tags I wear I don't keep up so very well these days and my back is giving me a little trouble at the moment so I'm further behind than usual.  I've gotten very philosophical about housework in the past seven weeks, lol.  A two year old is good for that sort of thing!No sweets, dear, but mint or lime for tea...Doesn't that sound refreshing on this hot afternoon?  We had a brief break in the heat over the weekend and the week started out with cooler weather.  Tuesday morning after I saw John off to work and felt the sweet cool morning air, I came indoors and opened the windows all over the house and let the house breathe in fresh air.  I was able to keep them open until Josh got up.  Then I worried he'd bump one of those wobbly windows and have it come crashing down on his little hands.  I couldn't bear the thought of that so I closed them right up again, but gracious!  I just wish I could have bottled some of that clear, cool air and recorded the sweet, peaceful sounds of bird calls that trilled all about the house.  The birds certainly did relish that cool air as much as I did.   For all that it was mid 60's Tuesday morning, it was soon mid 90's and not in the least refreshing that afternoon!  And so it's been very warm ever since.I mentioned in 'This Week In My Home' that I've suffered a little home envy this past week.  Truth is that it's the shiny new finishes I'm envious of, not the size of a home, etc.  It just seems to me that after twenty years of living in our home it's no longer fresh...and frankly the money to refresh is just not there.  I try hard to make the best of what I have but you know, now and then it's just not hitting anywhere near the mark of my own ideal...and so I find myself wishing I could do a lot more rather than a little here and there. Then I walk into a lovely little home that's been thoroughly refreshed and there I am with a hard dose of envy trying to wiggle it's bitter way down my throat."},
{"title": "Frugal Friday:  Proceed With Caution", "date": null, "text": "Saturday:  I was certain I didn't have anything to make a big breakfast for John as he came in from work today but I went to the freezer and looked anyway.  Sure enough I found some sausage I'd forgotten about purchasing two weeks ago.  I had just enough eggs to fry and made toast.  Good enough!I planned a steak dinner for today, using the last of the steak from the freezer.  I also used lettuce, previously sliced tomatoes, red cabbage, a carrot to make a salad to go along with the meal.I had to go into town.  I knew I'd need eggs, was out of milk, wanted to treat John to a russet Baked Potato, something I haven't made in over a year. I also wanted to provide birthday pie for my two youngest who have birthdays just six days apart.   Katie was visiting today and I won't likely get a chance to see her again until her birthday is long past.  I spent about $30 today.  I realized I've spent about $80 the past week on groceries and still I need things.  I've cautioned myself to be mindful and very careful in the coming two week period.Washed a full load of dishes.  Bess washed two full loads of clothes, one of which contained some of our laundry.Don't have to water plants courtesy the cooler weather and end of week rain we've had.Pulled coffee from the pantry.  Bess had an extra gallon of whole milk for Josh's nightly bottle that she brought out of the freezer.I dug about in the fridge and realized we had plenty of stuff for sandwiches tonight.  We used the last of a bag of Cheese Puffs from Josh's birthday party last Sunday.In my home this week:   Another week behind, another week ahead.  On Friday this past week, I went down with Bess and Sam to see the new house.  It's a lovely place.  I admit to a wee small bit of home envy, which has taken root in me of late anyway courtesy the foolishness of having spent an entire afternoon viewing a bloggers' summer tour of homes that contained lovely things I have no way of possessing myself at the moment.  Not deep rooted envy, just a little moment and  I did quickly uproot it and put it aside. My family is so happy to have their home in their possession.  There's a bit of reno work to be done first, nothing too earth shattering and only delaying them about ten days before they can move in for good. I needed this weekend to remind me how very blessed I am.  I had a lovely day for the second time this month:  I had grandbabies in the house as well as my great nieces.   My niece is just a couple of years younger than Katie and Sam, Ashley and Katie all have children near in age.  There were just four here but at one point the house felt a bit like it was rollicking as aunts and cousins loved on children not theirs and children ran about screaming and laughing and playing.    Funny how four very little children can fill a house right up with noise.It might not have been the most peaceful Shabat, nor the most restful one on record, but this sweet season keeps getting sweeter and sweeter! ...I plan meals:"},
{"title": "Seriously?", "date": null, "text": "Confused by posts that have appeared and then disappeared today?  Wondering what on earth is going on?It's me.  I've been doing some much needed work on another blog with blogger, a recipe blog.  I'm trying to make a companion blog to this one.  Between computer glitches, a two year old running about, breaks and such, I've gotten confused.  So posts have mysteriously been posted to this blog that ought to have gone elsewhere and some posts were posted well ahead of time here that are meant for later in the week.  Pardon me while both sites are under light construction, won't you?  And please accept my apologies for any frustrations it might have caused you.Saturday:  Nearly 100f today.  We pulled curtains closed on the sunny side of the house, ran fans to help circulate the air.John washed a full load of clothes. He hung the bulk to dry.  I washed a full load of dishes.  This is not usual for us but it was necessary.Samuel replaced the ceiling fan in John's music room.  That's a nice bit of home improvement done over these two weekends that should help keep the house a little cooler.I cooked dinner entrée in the crock pot.  I made mashed potatoes from scratch but I think in future if it's this hot I'll use the instant potatoes.  I can boil water in the microwave and keep that heat down.  I decided to make cornbread, which used up the yolks from yesterday's birthday cake recipe.  I put a coffee cake in the oven to bake alongside.  I won't be using the oven again when it's this hot though.  It's just too hot and makes the AC work that much harder.I mixed up frosting for Josh's birthday cupcakes.  Bess wanted blue and green.  I made a half batch, divided it in half and colored each to suit.Bess and I went out to pick up supper as the guys vetoed any idea of baking anything in the oven this evening.  John paid from his allowance for take out for us all.  Bess and I carried off trash on our way into town."},

{"title": "In My Home This Week:  Two Big", "date": null, "text": "In my home this week:...on Sunday, Josh turns two.  He's learned so many things this past year: how to walk, how to talk, how to climb, how to fall...Ouch!  Life lessons can be hard, can't they?  And the life lessons we watch our children learn hurt us as badly as it hurts them.  It all starts with that first fall.  I've told my children these days are just training them to deal with the hurts their children will face when they are older.  Sad but true.I've made cupcakes for Josh's celebration.  His real family party will occur in July when the family is settled in their new home.  This is just an acknowledgement of his actual day.  Next year perhaps it will be more important to him than to us.  Do you remember how anticipated birthdays were when you were young?  I do.  It wasn't a big deal in my childhood home, but it was still anticipated.Saturday morning his Grampa got him out of bed.  Where he'd fuss and complain to me, \"No! No!  Mama!\",  not a peep came out of his mouth when his beloved Gah picked him up.  He rode out of the room on Grampa's arm like a proud prince on his finest steed, smiling from ear to ear.  I'm telling you that Gah is something special in this boy's eyes.  Gramma Gah is okay but Grampa is the thing.I think I'm liking this new season, this sweet season of life....we plan meals:"},
{"title": "Frugal Friday:  Trying To Make a Difference", "date": null, "text": "My last project, using mostly what I already had on hand...I'm pretty pleased with it.Saturday:  I went into town this morning to pay booth rent.  I made zip again this month for the third month in a row.  I talked it over with the owner and told her I'll be giving in my notice at the end of July.  Went by the post office to mail off Josie and Rosalyn's birthday gifts, which I combined into one box.  I went by the grocery and picked up extra large trash bags and ice cream.  John has mentioned ice cream multiple times in the past week.  It's a small indulgence.Stopped off at two yard sales.  I spent $.75 at one on two books and $7 at the other.  I purchased another rectangular frame to do a second set of the seed packet prints for the living room wall and a purse.  I also got a large bottle of Goo Gone for a very good price.Came home and made garlic butter spread for toast and a salad to go with the Crock Pot Lasagna Bess made.I've been raising the AC temperature 2 degrees more during the day.  It's been mighty warm of late and when I heard the AC kick on at 7am this morning, I knew it was imperative I follow my energy saving protocol.  I kept room darkening shades and curtains closed on the sunny side of the house and let in natural light on the shady side of the house.  We all commented this afternoon on how much cooler the living room felt when I pulled the curtains closed on the west side.  It's awfully dark and almost gloomy in the living room with the curtains pulled but cooler and I'll take gloomy with cooler temps rather than have it light and too warm.Everyone said they were too full following our late lunch to eat supper, but I know better.  Sure enough, food was wanted but no one wanted a heavy meal.  I had vegetable beef soup in the freezer which I heated for three of us and John opted to have a bowl of cottage cheese with applesauce.Every now and then it pays to have a financial conversation, whether they are unhappy or happy in nature.  I have two medical bills that I've been paying down steadily, but slowly over the last three months.  John has opted to take on more overtime in an effort to get these bills paid off in full.  I am determined that if he's working harder I can change a few things myself.  I indulged myself with a Birch Box subscription at the beginning of March and I've really enjoyed it but truly?  Well it's $10 a month I would rather put into something needed here at home which will free up $10 more to go towards those two bills.  It's a small amount but it's a start.I've meant to focus on the front porch since summer 2014...but then we'd asked my brother to get us a quote on redoing one section of it and John suggested I wait.  He figured my brother could paint the whole porch at one time when the rebuilding was finished.  I agreed.  After all, why waste money on paint when you know it's going to be painted later?Well here we were this past summer (2015) and the back porch still looked fairly fresh and new and the front porch looked terribly shabby.  I'd added to the shabbiness over the year as this porch became my studio for spray painting since it was going to be painted afresh anyway.   Looking at medical expenses and judging my brother's new job and his very busy schedule for carpentry work, I realized we weren't likely to see this rebuild any time soon.  I couldn't bear having the porch look so bad.  It got worse.You see mid-way of cleaning railings, I decided to paint the iron chairs with a fresh coat of red.  And even though I carefully laid out newspapers, a rough breeze came up and slung papers here and sprayed paint there and...well what didn't get on  the chairs, covered me and the porch floor.  Now it really looked horrible.  Ugh.  To add insult to the whole affair the tacky (as in sticky) red spray paint over four coats of latex paint did no favors either.  Every step I took, great sheets of paint layers came up.  I got busy scraping the paint off the porch, working in ten and fifteen minute increments throughout most days.  I never did get it all up but I got up every loose bit up after something like a month of scraping floors.  That was August 2015...Hello and do come in!  It's been a little more difficult of late to have a chat or write a post but that is to be expected.  It does seem, even the sweetest little almost two year old boy is true master of the household and when he's fussy, the world falls at his feet in an attempt to make his world right once more.  Josh is pretty well behaved overall and not the messiest of children but there's enough extra to do to keep one hopping.  When he feels off then we all try our very best to soothe him.  He calls John and I \"Gah\".  He's very fond of John who didn't woo or cajole him but simply was himself and let Josh decide on his own that Grampa was A-okay.  They now have a special handshake that is all their own.  It begins with a conventional handshake, a fist bump, a high five and then they snap their fingers and point at one another.  Josh can't snap but he twiddles his fingers and points, just to imitate Grampa.  It's all ended with a kiss.  It is the cutest thing to watch the two of them.  And now I see that indeed life without this little one about will be a little less than it was before he came into my home to smile his sweet dimpled smile at me.  This segment of our sweet season is rapidly coming to an end, if not at the end of next week then just a little further alongWell, it's all been lovely, truly it has, but they close on their home next week and are very much looking forward to having their own furnishings and routines and unpacking of clothes and not living in suitcases.  And most especially having all their kitty cats in their home once more.  I had been thinking along the same lines about living from suitcases myself.  When we go on vacation I like to unpack and act as though I'm there to stay awhile, not on my way out of the door at any moment.  I told John that more than ever I'm determined to put a dresser and chest of drawers in that room.  I'd use one piece as storage for my fabric and craft items and have one piece reserved for guests to use to unpack their clothes.  I think the room needs a comfortable seat, some place to relax besides lying upon the bed.  I guess, given all these things, I'll give up my idea of a vanity and look for more appropriate storage pieces...A vanity is something I've wanted since I was a girl but as a woman I have to own that what is wanted from a childhood dream isn't always just what is the most practical nor the most needed."},
{"title": "This Week In My Home:  Happy Days", "date": null, "text": "In my home this week:...I had a week full of grandchildren this past week and this grandmother's heart is happy.   Of the nine grandchildren, I talked to one via text, and visited with 5 others.  All in all, a rare week and a very happy one.  This week will be a happy one as well.  Those of you who shared with me how very much you've enjoyed having your grandchild or grandchildren living with you.  Well I'm finding Josh just such a joy in my life.  Daily he does something to amuse me or tug at my heart strings in some way.   Oh how I wish I had this opportunity with all, but just possibly not all at the same time! My oldest son confessed his concern that a home task might keep him from visiting this past week.  And we weren't just certain if all three children would come with him, since in the past he felt overwhelmed with all three.  Happily my son finished his task enough to leave it behind and came with all three children.  The house exploded.  Honestly, it's been since I've had grandchildren that I realized that my home is a small house.  Before that I'd have said it was average sized but it's small (1100 sq. ft.) and never seems so small as when the grandchildren are literally racing from one end to the other and back again and the grown ups are ranged about the dining table and living room chatting.  I enjoyed seeing them.  I hadn't seen Hailey in over a year.  The boys are taller than they were last summer when I saw them last, Zach almost as tall as Daniel though 2 years separates them.  What was the most fun was to hear Hailey mothering Josh during a crying spell.  And to watch Josh who is almost, but not quite, two suddenly realize that Zach, at four, was the sort of boy he wanted to be.  \"Dack\" soon had a shadow.  Josh declined the high chair and sat on the dining chair.  He ate foods he'd have shook his head at and said \"No\" to any other time.  He ran.  He followed.  He went up and down the front steps hundreds of times.  If the big kids did it, he at least attempted it too and he did a fine job of keeping up."},

It was seeming dull to us.  I decided to experiment with some different seasonings and discovered that we really like it with salt, a little black pepper, a little sprinkling of onion powder, and (this was the new to me seasoning), curry powder.  I had never had curry powder until then and thought it was just a single seasoning, like garlic, or pepper.  The curry powder is a mixture of several different seasonings, coriander, fenugreek, turmeric, cumin, black pepper, bay leaves, celery seed, nutmeg, cloves, onion, red pepper, and ginger.  I use McCormick brand.  Even though it lists red pepper in the ingredients, I have never felt the heat of it, and I don't notice a specific cloves flavor.  I am not a fan of spicy, tongue burning seasonings.  Somehow, the scent of the curry seems much stronger than the flavor after it is cooked. I use the curry powder very sparingly, because I believe it could become overwhelming To me it has made a big difference in the flavor of baked/roasted chicken. Embarrassing to admit, but I used to mostly only like the baked chicken skin, where the flavor was.  Now with different seasoning it all tastes good to me."},
{"title": "Book Review:  Braving It by James Campbell", "date": null, "text": "I have this thing about books about Alaska.  I've read dozens and dozens.  I was sure I'd enjoy reading this one and I was not disappointed.  The book opens with Mr. Campbell taking his daughter to spend a summer in Alaska to help build a new cabin for friends who frontier.  He knew that his daughter was naturally athletic and competitive.  He felt sure she would enjoy the experience, though it involved physically taxing work.   He was well aware of the dangers he was exposing her to, having previously lived there.   Mr. Campbell observes his daughter's mental and emotional growth as she pushes her limits physically, enduring hardship and hard work.A second visit  occurs in late Fall to the same cabin and friends.  This time his daughter learns to hunt, trap and survive a typical Alaskan winter, with all the dangers of freezing, falling through thinning ice, as well as the experiences.  His daughter's relationship with Edna and Heimo  deepens as does her love of the Alaskan wilderness.I urge you to read this book.  It is well written, and explores the mental strain as well as the physical and emotional toll of parenting and living in the Alaskan wild. His pride in his daughter as she tests her limits also clearly comes through as does his strong father's love for her as he allows her to test her strengths in that age old and oh so difficult dance of being protective and letting go.  The juxtaposition of those descriptions next to his daily life in Wisconsin are cleverly done.  It amplifies the differences of 'civilized' rural life to Alaskan frontier life.   His great fondness for his friends' as well as his admiration of their abilities in dealing with daily life in the Alaskan wild comes through in his writing, as well.  I'm adding this book to my bookshelf for keeps.  I shall enjoy it again and again.This book was provided for review by Blogging for Books.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          The start of it all...This spring I wanted to make the most of what I have.  So much of my previous work had disintegrated over time, which happens, especially in the yard, if it is not maintained.  It really does require an almost daily upkeep of some sort and I'd not given that attention to my yard over the past year.   I had gotten very frustrated with my lack of ability and lack of finances, too.  So in this year of \"Start where you are, use what you have, do what you can,\" I decided to do what I could.  If that meant I could only work 15 minutes a day then I would get it done in 15 minute increments.  If it meant I could only spend $5, then I'd spend $5 now and $5 the next time I had it.  As things worked out, I've had a little more energy and money than I'd thought I'd might.  Happily, Mother's Day fell in this time frame and my son's gift was 10 bags of mulch plus he had a leftover bag from work he'd done on his own yard.which made for a mighty good start on the outdoor work.  He also put in new screening on the windows and storm doors.  We'd bought a couple of rolls of screening and splice as did he and he provided the labor in getting them all replaced.     I was given $20 to use towards the purchases of plants as a gift from Mama for Mother's Day and John gifted me a bird bath for our anniversary. I spent a total of $60 for plants and potting soil (2 bags) and mulch (10 more bags) that I purchased myself. The bulk of my work thus far was done using what I had.  I transplanted annuals that had come up from seeds that fell last year (or three years ago!) and moved them into pots.  This gave my budget a great boost, as did reusing pots of soil.  I purchase the moisture control potting soil which is about $10 for a 20 pound bag but I can use it for several years running. New plants mostly went into the baskets in front of the back porch or on the steps out back.   Pots and paint and stones and bricks went a long way towards the work I have done thus far.  I still have a load of pots and some paint and 8 bags of mulch.I don't have a photo of the chicken in the crock pot, just of the leftovers.  The recipe is essentially the one that Dee shared a couple of weeks ago for Sweet Chili Pineapple Chicken from the Brendid blog.  I could not find Sweet Chili Sauce.  Bess and I looked at two or three stores with no luck.  I opted to get the Archer Farms General Tso Sauce instead.  I was very pleased with the way the dish turned out."},

{"title": "A Very Quick Iced Tea Chat", "date": null, "text": "Well hello!  It's a beautiful summery sort of day outdoors.  Perfect for an iced tea and a fan and a chat.  We can sit by the pool if you'd like...If you don't mind having your feet in a kiddy pool as you sip your tea.  Or we can sit indoors and gaze over the yard.  I've just this morning potted up the last of the flowers I'd purchased over the past two weeks.  Not one went to waste, not a single one!  I wasn't that diligent last year but this year I've been very mindful of the need to USE what I purchase and make my expenditures impactful.  The birds have finally been drinking  at the bird bath which I think is rather fun.  Not many flock there yet, but I've seen a mocking bird and a blue jay over the past few days and that's just when the blinds were open.  I love to watch them drink.  This morning I added potted plants to the steps, which I skipped painting for now because frankly I'm a little done in with projects and plans and changes.  It seemed unnecessary work and I let it slide.  The potting of plants was where the money really was this time around and so that's where I concentrated my work.  I'm so pleased with all I've done though some of it needs to fill in a bit.  I've a post I'm working on that showcases all sorts of projects but would you like a little sneak peek?                                              One of my many projects this past week...Saturday:  John worked a 24 hour shift through 7am this morning.  I knew he'd be good and hungry but hadn't gone to the store as I ought to have done.  I had four eggs and a family of five to feed.  I decided to make a breakfast of toast, grits and sausage.  Not quite a full breakfast but it did well enough.  The family came in overnight.  I had a boneless turkey breast out.  I made the mayonnaise roasted turkey breast roast I've made before.  A big pan of Italian roasted vegetables went with the meal and filled us up without a lot of work on my part.  I used potatoes, zucchini, onion, peppers and mushrooms.The kids asked for a cobbler.  I had canned peaches in the kitchen cupboard and made up one of the easy cobbler recipes that uses equal measures of butter, flour, milk, sugar and fruit.We tried hard to be restful, but the truth is more people equals more work and I planned poorly all around.  I washed a full load of dishes in the dishwasher.The kids went out to dinner and a movie.  Grampa and I babysat Josh.  We three had supper together, just a simple quick chicken patty sandwich.Sunday:  Easy breakfast this morning of bagels and peanut butter and fruit.John and Bess each did a full load of clothes today.We went off to church and I repaired a bracelet on the way.John and I went by the grocery.  I completely forgot about milk and eggs.  Still have four eggs.  Still have five people in the house.  I'll figure out a way to stretch those eggs yet.John wanted to buy fried chicken.  I knew full well that our budget is already straining but I also knew that the man was trying to save me the work and the need to rush about when I got home.  I told him sure and thanked him for thinking of me.  We have enough leftover to feed us another meal.I worked out menus today but Bess came in from her day and  said \"Would you mind if I cook some, too?  Maybe every other night?\"  Well, no I don't.  I want them to feel at home.  We agreed to sit down and figure out a meal plan for the week tomorrow morning.  Of course, mine is pretty much thought out but it's a good time to discover what they like and don't like and adjust accordingly.Sam made his awesome pizza and sauce.  I've got the recipes and will share and he had me take pictures of the dough and how it should look for you all as well.  That will come up in another post this week.  We used what we had to top the pizza.   What we had: turkey pepperoni, turkey Italian sausage, mushrooms, onions, peppers, and of course, tomato sauce.  It takes only 4 ounces cheese to make two medium pizzas.  We had leftovers.While at the grocery today I bought a begonia plant as my flowers for the upcoming pay period.  It was $3.99 and should last longer than cut flowers now that it's gotten warmer here.  We run fans to move the air and that dries the flower out more quickly when the rooms are warm.  I will try to keep some sort of green or flowering plant in the house over the summer months, with an eye to what I might put in the yard or use on the porches.We picked up a Sunday paper while we were out.  I was happy to get coupons.Monday:  We washed three loads of clothes today.  I dried one load on the line and drying rack.  The rest went into the dryer.Washed a full load of dishes.John mowed lawn while I kept Josh and did the housework.  We all skipped lunch and just snacked.  I carefully snacked on fruit/protein/whole grains so that I kept my sugar in check.  I'm running a little higher than I have been in the past.  I lay this at not sleeping well and being a little out of routine.John and I went down to pick up his check.  We went to the bank, went to the post office and took a long ride home.  We took off the trash on our way out.I cooked supper this evening.  Bess and I have worked out a division of labor that will hopefully work for us both.  The house is staying reasonably decent, things are getting done.  Mostly it's just keeping up and for right now that's good enough.Tuesday:  Bess and I went to the grocery store.  We shopped at Aldi and each of us bought our own snacks and dairy.  She bought items for the meals she'd planned, I bought what was needed for meals I'd planned and the produce we'd use this week.  I was shocked at how low my total was today, well within budget with money to spare and Bess was pleased with her total too, which was even lower.We came home to have lunch, eating leftovers.Bess prepared supper.  It was a very tasty inexpensive meal from a menu service that she joined about a year ago.  They provide an Aldi shopping list, the menu plan etc so that you can stick to a pre-set grocery budget.  This service has been invaluable to her.  She also cooked chicken in the crock pot to make two pans of enchiladas (also a menu service recipe).  As she was starting to put them together, I got a call from my oldest son saying he and his children would be coming up end of next week to spend a couple of days.  Bess suggested we keep the enchiladas until next week to serve as a family dinner.  I agreed.  We're both pleased to have that meal ahead.  I'll see if we can't come up with one more meal we can make in quantity before next week.  That will keep breakfast and lunch as the only meals to really make and both of those will be simple ones.John did a load of clothes and hung them to dry while we were gone.Wednesday:  John and I had a breakfast of toasted frozen French Toast.  These were leftovers from a meal last week.John and I left the family at home and went to Home Depot.  We need to replace an outlet in the music room.  John had researched what to purchase.  When we got to Home Depot a gentleman told John that he couldn't buy what he was looking for and that to replace the outlet would cost at least $16 or more.  He told John how to change what we have with items we could purchase for under $5 per outlet.  I purchased bulk petunias and a shepherd's hook for the yard today.  That completes the back porch flower bed project and made up hanging baskets for the front porch.  Next I'll pot plants for the ironing board.  I priced out options for hanging my curtains on the front porch.  I think I can do what I want for under $10.I bought more paint, too, to finish off the ironing board.  I bought two cans but turns out I needed only one.  I'll carry the second can back and swap for one of the paints I need to continue work on my dining chairs.I started dinner in the crock pot before leaving home.  It's a new to me recipe (lots of those this week) but not pricey to make.  It was nice to know at the end of this afternoon of being out, then coming home to pot up some of my plants, watering, painting the ironing board, etc.  that dinner was cooking away indoors.Slowly we're working into a routine.  Bess did laundry, cleaned their room and bath while we were gone.    Josh was able to get in his morning nap.John decided to work a half day tomorrow.  He'd asked me on the way home what we owed on medical bills we're currently paying.  It felt good to say we'd paid off the loan (did that about two months ago) and we owed a low amount on the two bills we're paying currently.Thursday:  I  opened windows today when John left.  It was so cool outdoors and the birds were singing and peace just filled the house with all that cool.  We kept the windows open until nearly 11 today.I spent an hour or two outdoors this morning.  I potted up every single plant I'd bought in the past two weeks.   I haven't always been mindful of this and so I consider it a huge savings to actually plant all I bought this time.I had to go into town to pick up birthday cards and a gift card.  While on my way out, I took off trash, made a deposit to savings at the local bank and went to the dollar store.  I was so happy to find I could buy the gift card I wanted at the Dollar Store.  No savings in that purchase except in gasoline and time.  I found a small blow up pool for Josh for $5.  It seemed a good purchase.  Josh enjoyed playing in the pool after lunch.Though we had a menu plan for the whole week, I used my usual method of planning twice.  We had loads of leftovers so we decided to have leftovers night.  This cleared lots of space in the fridge.I used mashed potatoes to make potato pancakes as a side dish.We didn't eat the rest of the Italian Beef.  I put in a container in the freezer and made sure to label it so I would know what we had.Friday:  I had thought we'd open windows this morning but about a half hour after I got up the AC started running.  It's gonna be a hot one today!I made breakfast sandwiches for John and I.  Josh likes bacon, so I cooked an extra slice for him.While breakfast was cooking, I swept up the back porch.  I made a project from my old watering can.  It was a Pinterest project I'd pinned.  I had all the materials on hand.  It turned out really cute.I made Banana bread using some over ripe bananas.  When the cooking time was up the banana bread was not quite ready.  I turned off the oven and left the bread in place.Cut up watermelon.  Now we've eaten all the leftovers I have room to store the melon chunks.I couldn't find the item needed to season today's meal.  After looking high and low I settled upon a bottle of a different seasoning which should work as well with the recipe.To save time this evening, I cut up vegetables and set up the rice/water."},
{"title": "In My Home This Week:  New Beginnings", "date": null, "text": "In my home this week:The little bird that nested on the back porch last year is back.  John mentioned we had a bird nest on the cupboard shelf next to an extension cord.  I noted the nest but didn't think too much of it until this week when I was working outdoors potting plants and I realized I was keeping Mama bird from her business.  I hurriedly cleared up my mess and came indoors.  She flew in and out while I worked about the porch Friday morning and even this morning as I rocked on the porch before the family woke, she went about her business feeding her family.  It made me mindful that I needed a breakfast plan. The family came in last night in the wee hours of the morning.  This morning we attempted to talk but there's so much going on at once there's little time to get a full sentence out of our mouths.  Nevertheless, I did gather that we're probably looking at about 6-8 weeks.  It will be roughly a month before either of the house sells will close.  There will be some minor work done on the new home.Today I realized that this 'visit' will be a stretching of myself in many ways:  managing our budget, our time, our energy...most especially my own time and energy.  Score one on my side.  I realize during the last weekend the family was here together that my morning time prayer and study would be a pleasant memory only unless I moved from the kitchen area into a more private space.  When I discovered yesterday evening that the family was coming in two days early, I quickly set things to rights before sundown.  My last act was to move my Bible, prayer journal and devotional into our bedroom.  I didn't leave my room this morning until I'd had that quiet time and it set my day off on the right foot."},

I originally got the recipe from a frugal living board on ivillage from Tawra Kellam who has the Living on a Dime website now.http://allrecipes.com/recipe/45954/roast-sticky-chicken-rotisserie-style/ I no longer roast it for 4 hours, since that is a Long time to leave your oven on, plus expensive electricity use. I roast for 20 min/pound and we still like it. Dawn:  I also love that lava cake recipe.  It is so easy but very good.  I shared a recipe for spinach dip that was a hit at a bridal shower this past weekend:  http://ahomeinthecountry.blogspot.com/2016/05/spinach-dip-recipe.html Lana:  This chocolate pound cake is so, so good and it turned out perfectly which is not always the case with pound cake recipes.  I baked it in a tube pan and it almost overflowed so next time I will put it in two loaf pans.  http://southernbite.com/chocolate-pound-cake/These muffins are almost always in my freezer for my husband's lunches.  A few more chocolate chips go in ours and I use 4 bananas for moist muffins.  http://designeddecor.com/tantalizing-tuesday-chocolate-chip-banana-muffins/#comment-3227"},

{"title": "This Week In My Home:  Ch-Ch-Changes", "date": null, "text": "This week in my home.......I've been busy of late.  John asked me Friday, \"Is there someone timing you?  You've been acting as though you have a deadline to meet!\"  Well...No.  But I'm so excited about all the creative thoughts flowing through my mind that I am determined to get busy and start making my visions reality.  Fortunately the greater portion of my inspirations are do-able, and affordable.My big source of inspiration has been that quote I found earlier in the year: Start where you are, Use what you have, Do what you can.  Take my work on Friday.  I've purchased paint a little at a time, a can here and a can there for various projects.  There's almost always leftover paint isn't there?  So I'm using up leftovers and have painted the three ladder back chairs I want to use in my back porch flower bed.  I will be painting the old set of steps under the pecan tree too.  I saw a photo in Pottery Barn of a plant stand that was a set of steps...I have a set of steps.   I also happen to have a can of black paint. As it happens that set of steps is clearly seen from my chair in the living room.  I think a vision of pretty pots of flowers will do me good, don't you?I'm also beginning a long put off project of getting my dining room chairs painted and recovered.  I can't even recall how long we've had them but Katie was still living here when I got them and I've been meaning to paint and recover ever since.  Well this is the time.  I officially have one painted chair and I have covers cut and a brand new staple gun.  And while I was working on the chair there was a vision of my table and buffet all painted.  I am sure repositioning the dining table this past week helped get all of this inspiration going.Why all this busyness and push?  Because I want and need to see pretty things about me and I realized that I can wait forever and ever, thinking that one day there will be money enough (maybe but who wants to wait to see?) to hire or buy things done but there's something in me that wants to see what I can do where I am with what I've got.   It's part and parcel of making home where I am at the moment instead of waiting for something better to come along.  It's important to live now and not one day some day down the road.                                                   Dee shared this on her Facebook page and being a history buff I thought it was so cool to see historical photos superimposed over modern day photos of the same area.  This was well done and gave a sense of timelessness to the Paris street scenes.  I really enjoyed viewing these photographs.Years ago I did a full tutorial on Vanilla for Penny Ann Poundwise newsletter readers.  This contains much of the same information.  I'll have to start digging up a few of those old informational things from my old newsletter items to share, but in the meantime why not make reading a learning experience as well, right.  I came across this on Vanilla this past week.  Being clothes minded I read Bridgette Rae's weekly blog posts.  I liked her post on the well dressed woman.  I'm not yet up to 'investing' in quality pieces but I do believe in 'asking for help' in the form of Pinterest, Polyvore and Rae's outfit posts.This post on Passover was thought provoking.  It is not written from a Messianic or Jewish view but from a spiritual standpoint."},
{"title": "My Frugal Week:  Balancing Acts", "date": null, "text": "My little herb garden.  Rosemary, parsley and basil thus far.  I plan to add sage, dill, Thai basil and mint.  I'll be adding pots to the area and moving out the decorative things to use elsewhere.  You can see the basil is already growing well.  The parsley is up in the far back left bucket.Saturday:  This day is always simple, and today was simpler than usual.  Bagels and choice of fruit and toppings (butter, jam, cream cheese and nut butters).  Cost to me was the bag of bagels I picked up at the grocery on Thursday, so less than $2 and we had an ample breakfast.Samuel treated us to lunch out today.  Supper is always wanted.  I had leftover fajita chicken and plenty of vegetables on hand.  I asked Samuel if he'd like to make pizzas for supper.  We decided to do a chicken Bbq pizza and a vegetable pepperoni one.  My task was to prep vegetables and cheese.  Sam made the crust which was awesome.  We all had a slice of each and there were two slices left to go into John's work lunch.Coffee seems to be the most asked for item in the house at the moment.  We're making about 2 pots more per day than we usually do.  I've been reusing grounds and adding half as much fresh for the second pot.  No one has made a complaint yet."},
{"title": "Iced Tea Chat:  If You Can't Say Something Nice...", "date": null, "text": "I kid you not...I've been trying to write up an iced tea chat for four days.  So far I've had to strike every single one and start over again and why?  Because each one has been a litany of whines and complaints over something that upset or hurt or frustrated me.   As I cleared off the page once again this afternoon, I realized that Granny's old adage was quite right and one I must do my best to follow: \"If you can't say something nice, then don't say anything at all.\"  Only a blank page and a photo of happy girl with her iced tea hardly a blog post makes.  So we'll try again and hope that things go better.  I will recapture the two weeks for you in a few brief words and say nothing much about it and then we'll move on, okay?Well first let us begin with tea.  No sweets nor bakery items this week.  I keep thinking I shall make something and then I went to the doctor and weighed two pounds less and I changed my mind about baking after all, lol.  Nothing like incentive!  But there is tea, and lemons and limes and ginger root if you'll have it and lots of ice.  Isn't the weather just ripe for iced tea?  The AC repair man was in earlier to give us our annual Freon boost and he said he was working rather hard just now.  It seems so every year about this time.Maddie was badly beaten up by our son's dog who was re-homed shortly thereafter, his aggressive behavior towards her being the final straw in a series of events that had made him a difficult pet. Fortunately he was turned over to a man who trains aggressive dogs for guard and police duty.  Poor Maddie, poor dog and poor family who truly did love dog and were trying hard with him.  I spent nearly a week weeping over it all because it was too much for my tender heart.  John quite lost patience with me.  Maddie was hurt but not mortally wounded.  Her spirit was traumatized.  She's such a gentle loving dog for the most part and only ever snarks if other dogs come too close, but she lay about for a week, shying away from any inquiry or attempt to touch her, refusing to come up on the porches,  worrying us no end.  I was the last person she'd come to as I was with her at the time she was attacked and though I tried desperately to get dog to stop, he paid me no mind whatsoever.  He's not much of a respecter of females but did eventually respond to John who showed great command.  I'll go no further with the story.  Maddie is better, dog is re homed, family is resolved if heartbroken and all is peace here once more.My son took me out to eat that Sunday following that most awful Saturday.  I had to take him to the east side of Macon to pick up his personal vehicle.  He suggested we go early (he's a very early riser) and eat breakfast.  I had, for the very first time, Eggs Benedict, or at least a variation of it.  I got distracted by the waitress who was in good spirits and forgot to ask for turkey bacon instead of bacon.  First bite and I realized my mistake, of course.  I found the bacon flavor overwhelmed the hollandaise entirely and removed the remaining bacon from the dish.  The foods were hot and they were good and fresh so I'm not complaining about the food or service or anything...but I was a little disappointed.  It was pretty much a white sauce moment for me.I'll explain.  In the years prior to my having my own home, I'd been reading Emilie Loring novels all one summer and she was forever espousing how lovely white sauce was... I also loved to read a certain cookbook that Mama had.  It was one that no one ever touched, in fact, it lived in the depths of a deep narrow cabinet.   It was, of course, the cookbook that has long since become a favored old friend of mine, The Culinary Arts Institute Encyclopedic Cookbook.  Well there was the recipe there in the cookbook and it wasn't a delicacy at all but what we in the country called milk gravy!  Disappointment was great and all that.  Ditto with Hollandaise.  I've heard it's praises sung for ages but it was my first experience with it.  I found it okay, very delicate in flavor and prone to being overcome by the taste of anything upon which it sat.  Glad I tried it.  Now I'll set myself up for another culinary surprise, lol.I broke my favorite coffee mug, a Christmas gift of sorts from John this past year and not to be mistaken for my lovely thermal cup or my Saturday morning coffee cups which Katie and Matt gifted me.  How did I break it?  I poured coffee into it and heard it begin to crack and watched the cup start to gape and hot coffee went everywhere.  I was quite startled by it and bewailed my not purchasing another the day before while out with Samuel as I'd thought to do.  Pooh!I worked far too hard in the yard and paid dearly in pain for that foolishness.  I might have quit well ahead of time but I didn't.  Sad to say that for all that, I didn't quite complete the task either and had to put in another two hours at it last Friday but it's lovely now and I've moved on to a new space.  I'm taking it far easier in trying to work out how that shall look.I took Mama out to eat at a favorite eatery on my next free day.  I don't know just why it was off, but Mama's food didn't come as described, was cold and she was mighty dissatisfied overall.  Thank goodness for free pie that day because I'm afraid she'd have sworn never to go back.  My food, by the way, was all delicious and fine and I was quite satisfied but Mama refused every offer of another entrée on the house to eat in or take away as she chose.On Shabat last week my son and his family (they came in Friday afternoon) took us out to eat at a Korean restaurant we enjoy.  And Samuel made two lovely pizzas for supper that evening.  Eating out is a weekend treat for them and we were invited to tag along.  We enjoyed it but I must confess that going out and fighting traffic and road construction turns and twists and all such did not feel like a restful peaceful Shabat.  I do know that peaceful Saturdays at home  is likely to change with family in the house with us and that it is temporary but I'm hopeful that this Saturday will be a quiet peaceful day since it will be just the two of us.  I wanted, on Mother's Day, to spend the day alone.  It might sound odd, but it was what I wanted.  My son and Bess were off to see her parents.  John was working.  Katie had other plans. I knew the rest of my children would call and I wanted to be able to chat leisurely with them.  I was perfectly okay with being at home alone and everyone knew it including the one person who stopped by anyway and told me plainly she didn't care that I wanted to be alone.  It was a negative visit with someone who doesn't respect my boundaries ever,  and as I took a phone call from my oldest daughter she made me feel I had to rush off the phone by sighing deeply repeatedly, so my longed for conversation with Amie and her family was cut to about three minutes .I've had several nights of poor sleep.  I can't decide which is worst: lying awake with owl eyes peering into the darkness or dozing in fitful snatches and waking to lie awake for an hour or so before dozing in more fitful snatches.  Or a night that combines both bookended together. Ugh.Politics dominate just now and it's only going to get worse I'm afraid.  I shall say little on the subject except that I'm not thrilled with any candidate, don't trust the electoral delegates in the least and am praying hard.  There are myriad local elections going on and you can barely tell a 'For Sale' sign on a lawn from the plethora of election signs that dot lawns as well.  I did wonder momentarily just how much those signs affect the notice houses for sale might get.There was one sign that read \"Vote for Misty\".  That was it.  No last name.  No idea what office Misty was running for either.  I told John I feel disinclined to vote for anyone who thinks they can get by on recognition of their first name only.  It seems a bit too casual for my taste.I will say honestly that I am sure of two things.  No matter how much it's spoken of, Hilary Clinton will not be indicted over this whole email thing despite what some media news keeps pushing.  I think it was swept off the table long before this campaign began and that it is not even thought of at all by her higher ups.   And I do believe that we're seeing history made.  I don't think the Democrat nor Republican parties are going to carry as much weight in the future as they have in the past.  I believe this country is so looking for change that we'll find ourselves with new political parties in coming elections.  So that's it. I'm going no further with all that.  Bess and Josh joined Sam here this past weekend and I had a feel for what life with them might be like for the next month or so and decided we will survive it.  I laid down gentle house rules and we are all agreed to do our best for the month to six weeks they shall be here.  These kids amuse me.  They go to bed rather early, usually by 9pm (and that's late for them!) and are up quite early in the morning.  They make me feel a bit of a rebel to stay up until 10:30 or to lie abed after 7am.  I will say that Sam and Bess are rather like minded to John and I, just as Katie and Matt are.  It's no hardship to have them in the house and I've noted all week how diligent Samuel has been to try and remember the house rules, which is much appreciated.We've decided we shall try to just lead our lives as much normally as we can, but I've found the constant interruptions to my prayer and study time do necessitate moving out of the kitchen area where I normally sit of mornings.  As well I'm going to have to declare my temporary space as a no phone zone because morning texts are interrupting as well.  I don't want anyone else to stop texting or talking, I just need to reorder the main morning activity.  I am thinking hard about how I might get coffee in the bedroom which I think will be my temporary space.It's fun watching the grandchildren at their current ages. Josh is now quite the parrot when repeating anyone but it's gibberish when he attempts to say it all on his own.  I've loved hearing him say his ABC and counting to 10, or parroting back a sentence \"Pick me up please\" for instance.  He did tickle us all Saturday evening.  We've eaten every meal as a family since their arrival and Saturday evening I was just tired.  I suggested we all have our pizza before the TV.  Josh went to the table and cried at us because we weren't there.  He was not well pleased at being in the living room.  The kids thought it too funny since they eat most of their meals in the living room.  I think they'll find they really do need to use that gorgeous dining table at least once daily as a family after staying here with us, because it is so important to Josh. Katie sends photos of Taylor standing on her own and climbing over barriers put down to keep her in the play areas. She's begun to speak clear words too, and asks for her dog by name each morning. Hard to believe she shall be a year old in a few weeks...Oh time does fly!  JD reported that Zach, who has resisted potty training rather hard, caved when he was told he'd have to stay home from school unless he could learn to go potty like a big boy.  It seems going to school next autumn was just the incentive he needed!  I didn't get to speak long to Amie, as I reported, so no clue what the children are up to there.  Josie will be 13 this year and has been allowed to go on Facebook.  I'm not too concerned at present since her first friend requests were all to family members!  So that's the family news.On Monday of this week I went to the doctor and asked please to come off the Coumadin.  I am on half dosages until this current bottle runs out and then I'm off completely thereafter, which will put me at the one year mark.  Unless I have an illness or problem for other reasons, I am no longer under doctor's care and do not have to have any more blood testing done.  I confess that May this year feels much like a 'New Year' to me after all that went on last year and looking back I shake my head in wonder at all the scary and terrible and wonderful things that the past year has encompassed.  Its been quite a year!  Fortunately, things went well for me, for us, and 'normal' took on a variety of disguises as I found my way through.I mentioned yard work.  There's so much that wants to be done!!  I finally made up my mind that I should simply follow the Arthur Ashe quote that I found in a magazine and posted on my clip board where I see it each time I pick it up:  \"Start where you are, do what you can, use what you have.\"   Where I am is at the beginning, what I can do is a little at a time and what I've been using is some of what I have and some of what I've found really inexpensively and what I've accomplished has astonished me.  Who knew?!  I've three lovely flower beds at present, I'm working on a new one.  My front porch is finally close to being finished and the back porch needs cleaning and a little something extra for work but both are going to be quite nice once I get that done.   My house is pleasing overall and coming along a little at a time, too.  This afternoon I shifted the dining table and found the area just looks so much more roomy and less cramped than before.  I have plans for so many things my head almost aches thinking of all I want to do.  I've come to some firm decisions about various things, too. First, there's the booth.  It gelled for me this week when I went in and paid full rent on my booth.  It's not a huge sum nor does it affect our household budget in the least, but for the bulk of this year I've paid a majority of the rent each month out of my pocket money, as I'd told John I would when I started.  I worked hard at my booth in mid April.  I looked it over and critiqued it and while in St. Augustine I went into a couple of similar stores curious both to seek treasure and to see how I stack up in comparison.  Truthfully, my stock is good stuff.  It's not junk.  The store where my booth is located doesn't look like much.  Some of the booths are quite nice and some are so so and some spaces are just thrift store quality.  I don't know what else to do at this point to generate interest and I can't, honestly, go out to thrift and pick up more new merchandise when things are not selling that are there now. I never went into this thinking I'd be rolling in earnings, but I had thought I'd make rent and a little more besides each month, you know expand my pocket money a tad.  Well that hasn't happened in three years. I was talking it over with John earlier this week and I said I was thinking of letting it go when I work through this current year (which ends August 31).  I spoke of it with Samuel one evening and in one of those enlightening moments I said to him \"Why it's like I'm paying for storage space and it's costing me '$XXX a year  and I've got my own shed in the yard ..\" and that was it.  I knew then and know now that booth is history.  I don't know what I shall do with all the stock.  I do like it all, and some of it I will enjoy using.  I may try to do an Etsy shop or go back to eBay listings, but my time being a booth owner in our little town is done.And that brings up the need to clear the shed because I will need room to store things and right now it's rather packed.  There are some things that need to be moved out and let go of in that shed.  It's not a major project but it's not a day's work either.  I have made up my mind, cautiously, to let go of the small freezer.  It's mainly stocked with fruits I keep meaning to make into jams I oughtn't eat and chicken broth which I have in more ample supply than demand necessitates.  It is a handy spot to store milk, but then I've a load of things in the big freezer we seldom seem to use either and that space might be better used to store milk and broth both.  I don't need two freezers.  Frankly I'd love to use that closet space for craft storage or to extend the pantry or both,  though I'm not dead certain that's how I'll choose to use that space either.  But it is space and it's a closet which is high commodity in this house.  I do have plans for offering the freezer to someone but if there's no interest I'll see if I can sell it perhaps.  It's an older freezer but one of the most steadily running appliances I've ever had.  25 years now and not a single hiccup ever.Of course, I might add I'd also made up my mind that this was the year to landscape about the house.  Slow and steady it is but it's coming together nicely and I'm happy with the look of it all thus far.  I guess mostly I've made up my mind to stop putting things off thinking I can't because I don't have physical strength or money or time or ability.  Honestly that Arthur Ashe quote truly has inspired my thinking in so many ways!Take for instance the household budget.  I know what John makes and I know what we must pay out and I know what it takes for us to manage even with care.  John's doing his best by working an extra half shift at least once or twice a month and he'll continue to do so for as long as the time is available.  I don't count on it as income but I am trying hard to make it count when he does earn it.  So far, I've paid off a loan we took out last year to pay medical bills, have been steadily saving a set amount each month, setting aside money for real savings and for future medical bills, as well as putting a portion aside for two large bills that came in March.  I don't mind telling you that it's nice when we do have the usual short check and no overtime was available, to be able to pay whatever bills come up.  This month there was an added amount owed at the doctor's office for the first time and I knew I had it in my sub account so I paid it off.  I think John's rather pleased with me about it.  I was worried the pantry was looking a bit low, but honestly just now I don't know exactly what I have or need.  I moved a lot of things to the kitchen so I wouldn't have to invade the guest room too often.  I want the family to feel they've their own space, you know?  And I've brought as much out as I can store and keep it safe.  I told John that I'll make that my priority again when they're in their own home and we can settle back into ours.  I know we'll need to restock beef by then, most especially ground meat.  In the meantime, I'll do my best with what we can purchase and store and use the pantry foods to help extend the budget while we've a few more mouths to feed.  It is my intent to save all of the room and board money and hopefully use that to restock.Well, I'm afraid I'm chattered out...and it's getting late, too.  My nephew was just by to drop off packages he accepted in town from a courier service who was having trouble with his GPS.  Jason was heading home to supper and I realized with a start that I've actually been having tea all afternoon.  Time to start preparing for the evening hours in our homes.  Talk to you later!"},

{"title": "Questions and Answers and Comments, Oh MY!", "date": null, "text": "I started out April posting my final tally for the first quarter of the year in the \"Assigning Value to My Days\" post.  I was shocked at how well I'd done and glad too to see it come up to such a nice sum.  It gave me a much needed boost of confidence that I truly do make a difference with what I do in my home.Rhonda commented on how much she likes her black maxi skirts and I have to share that I finally had weather to wear mine and really enjoyed the comfort of it.  I wore it to church on Sunday and on our trip down to St. Augustine on Monday.  It was comfortable, cool (it was 90F that day) and didn't wrinkle, all great bonuses.  The olive green top I'd purchased to go with it bit the dust early.  John nor I thought to look at the label and it shrank badly in the wash.  I seldom have clothing that shrinks to a smaller size.  It just seems to get shorter and wider which is what the olive shirt did.  I'm trying to determine if I want to try to reuse the fabric and make another shirt or if I just want to scrap it.Kathy share how she'd used up pineapple in a blueberry cobbler...she said it was an experiment that turned out very tasty.  I have combined oranges and peaches to make a sort of fuzzy navel cobbler and it was mighty good, too.  Never let a limited amount of one fruit or a leftover of another keep you from experimenting.  If you're unsure how something might taste together you can always sample it before you mix it all up together.  That's how I discovered that strawberries and oranges go together rather well, too.Gramma D shared this hint:  If you take your printer cartridges out and shake them and reinstall you can get a few more uses from them."},

{"title": "In My Home This Week:  Planning for the Unknown", "date": null, "text": "In my home this week:The roses look much like this this year, but the lantana is already growing and the spider wort is no longer there.I knew this time was coming, so it's not unexpected.  We are prepared for it as much as one can be and cautiously looking forward:  our home will bulge a little at the seams as my son and his family move in with us as they sell a home, buy a home, transfer job, etc.  He is already here with us and his family will be here next weekend to visit and then later in the month come to stay with us while they are in transition.It is not my first time having a child return home.  Only my boys have come back thus far, both when leaving the service and getting established in their civilian life (or transition to another branch of service) and now.  It's never too hard, nor easy as you'd hope.  It is always a bit of a challenge and a bit of a fruit basket turn over but it works out.One way I cope is to accept a small room and board fee.  Keeping our budget in line is foremost and if that sounds mercenary, I will say in my defense that it's a nominal fee that literally covers the extra cost of food.  My sons have always appreciated the fact of paying their way and at the same time of having home comforts.  I try to strike the balance between the two.  Saturday:  No prep work done yesterday for today's meal but I wasn't much worried about it.  I knew I had several frozen homemade entrees in the freezer, there was produce to use up prior to leaving home.  I came home from the Strawberry Festival and popped a meal in the oven, made us an appetizer plate of cheese and crackers (by the way anyone else like Stilton as much as I do?) and put on a pot of coffee.  In honor of what we're terming 'the start of vacation' we had an adult beverage with our cheese and crackers.  Lovely.Yes, we went to the local Strawberry Festival. Not sure what John spent but I'd guess less than $1.50.  My own stack of books was $2.20 and I donated the rest of the third dollar to the Womens Club Building Refurbishing Fund.  It's a good cause since the Women's Club is in an 1830s home and a project that is near and dear to me is historical preservation.  Happily will I donate to any group that is trying to maintain one of our few remaining historical homes.We did not buy a thing to eat or drink at the festival.  Yes, we could have and likely would have enjoyed it, but with food waiting at home it was unnecessary.I spent $5 on a cute handmade cottage-y unpainted bird house.  That will go on the front porch and is one of my upcoming UFO projects (the front porch).I bought two new pillows for the living room back in late winter and like them fine but not quite...This past week when Bess was visiting she used the quilt I keep on the back of the wing back chair.  Remember it's a patterned quilt I had reversed to the white backing .  Well when Bess put the quilt away, she folded it pattern side out and I was smitten.  The colors are not garish bright but they are bright and clear and I realized that what my living room has been missing is that additional pop of color.  I left the quilt as it was and have been really liking how it looks with the small patterned pillow in front of it.  Well this morning I saw an ad on Facebook for a company that sells pillow covers and one in the ad caught my eye.  I went to the site and looked and found two pillow covers I loved for $7 each.  I think the two covers will be just the pop of color the room needs and just enough pattern to add interest.  And thankfully so very affordable."},

I generally only make our bed.  I plan meals ahead and do as much prep work and cooking as I can on Fridays.  Dishes are put away before Shabat begins on Friday evenings so I can simply rinse and stack dishes all day long on Saturday.  It becomes the restful day it is because I work hard on Fridays to make sure that its that way.Made pizza for lunch today.  I didn't chop vegetables yesterday so I kept it simple today with just olives and onions and the hamburger I made yesterday.  I made the dough from scratch.  One thing about a rising yeast dough is that it's quick to mix and then walk away from it and let it do it's stuff.  I made our dough half whole wheat flour so it had a nice texture and added fiber.  We opened windows and so the AC didn't come on until nearly 5pm.  I recalled we'd set it a little lower than usual the night before because the house hadn't gotten stuffy so I reset it to our more usual temperature.  This allowed us another 45 minutes of no AC.  When the AC came on the second time we shut all the windows.  The AC ran only two full cycles and never came on again that evening.I did load the dishwasher after dinner, as we had a full load of dishes.  I set it to wash on a short cycle.   Dishes air dried after the cycle was done."},

{"title": "A Season of Prayer", "date": null, "text": "Recently I've been told here on the blog how much some of you appreciate my prayers on your behalf and I've watched with a happy heart as more and more of you openly ask for prayer from myself and other commenters.  This is one of my main ministry areas, teaching others how to live well and thriftily and to use what they have to enhance and better their lives.  Prayer is also a huge ministry area in my life and has been for sometime.  To combine the two here has been unexpected and awesome.Prayer ministry is something God laid on my heart years ago,  but it took me a little while to 'get into' it.  First of all, I had to learn how to pray,  for myself and others.  I know most people have been taught that prayer is what we do for others but they never ever pray for themselves and will apologize for asking for prayer over themselves as well.  I was taught that prayers for personal needs was selfish and somehow wrong and that we ought to wait upon others to see a need and pray over it.   It felt very awkward  to pray for myself.  It took a long time to shake that feeling off and just tell God of a need and let it rest with him.   Honestly, it's the very best testing ground for prayers and I mean that.  Once you understand how to rightly pray for yourself you can be a far better warrior for others. About 9 or 10 years ago, I was watching a ministry program that was aired 5 evenings a week.  One night the evangelist said they wanted people who needed prayer for themselves or  family members to send in a photo and they would put them on a wall in the studio and would pray over them.  I was shocked that week by the number of photos that went up on that wall.  In about three days time it was covered from floor to ceiling.  In five days they'd begun to layer photos over the ones already on the wall.  It really broke my heart to think of the desperate need people felt to have someone pray.  I thought over the people I knew and was pretty sure a few of them had no one at all praying for them, including themselves.   When God breaks your heart over something, it's a sign you need to be doing something about it.  It was then I was certain I was being called to prayer.I went to the pastor at the church we attended and asked if we could begin a prayer wall.  It wasn't a big congregation but we soon had a substantial number of photos on that wall and each time I went into church I went over to that wall, looked at each photo and said a prayer over each one.  Soon other church members were doing the same thing.  I prayed every day at home as well.  Some pictures came down as prayers were answered and new ones went up.  It was an amazing ministry that just took off and confirmed my conviction that people were literally thirsting for prayer.About three years ago the pastor's wife told me they'd continued the prayer wall long after I left the church where I first answered the call to prayer.  It did my heart good to know that the ministry of prayer was continued by that church for as long as they were in that building.When we left that church and moved on to our next leg of this journey, I found that often I'd be asked to pray over someone in the synagogue and soon people were coming to ask if I'd pray for someone they knew.  I kept a list in my Bible and went over it every day.    A little over two years ago, I felt God wanted me to keep a prayer journal.  There's where I put my list, updated as needed each month.  I make notes on progress or full answers given.  If you want to watch God at work, keep a prayer journal and and update it!  It's awesome to watch a prayer list change!    So here I am still praying for people after all this time, carrying needs daily before God, asking him to help, to heal, to guide. Over the years I've learned a few things.  I'd like to share them with you.I've  learned to be cautious about stepping into prayers I know nothing about.Several years ago there was a man in front of my pew at a church who was just weeping and praying and praying and crying.  I was so moved by his excess of emotion that I began to pray, too.  I told God I wanted to come into agreement with that man.  Well!  God quickly moved and I heard plainly in my mind, \"Terri, you shouldn't be so quick to pray in agreement with someone when you've no idea what they are praying for...You can get entangled in things you really don't want to be involved with.\"  Wow.  It never occurred to me that I might be praying in agreement for something that wasn't right or which might cause harm to someone.   And that's another reason why I seldom will pray for 'unspoken requests'. I've learned to be specific in what I pray.I'm not much into the 'unspoken' prayer requests.  That's all right for a private matter when you're asking for public prayer but if you're just asking ME to pray then I like to have some knowledge of what the situation is and for whom I'm praying.   It's not being nosy.  It's so that I can be specific with God about what situation is generating the call to prayer.   If someone comes to me privately over and over again and asks for 'unspoken' requests then I ask them to be specific.  If they refuse then I tell them, I'm so sorry, but I simply can't pray that way for you.A pastor shared an example years ago about his child who was mighty sick and wouldn't eat.  The parents did all they could to get the boy to eat and he refused every thing offered.  Finally the pastor asked his son, \"If you could have anything at all to eat, what would you want?\"  \"I think I want a popsicle,\" the child replied.  So dad went off to town and bought popsicles.  But when he got home the boy refused to take a popsicle.  His dad was beyond frustrated.  \"But why?  You asked for popsicles, I bought you popsicles!\"  The child began to cry. \"But Daddy I wanted a PURPLE popsicle!\"  From that sermon I learned it's sometimes necessary to be very specific in what we're asking to be provided.  That's why I want others to be specific when they ask me to pray. I've learned to be careful in what I pray.Later my understanding of this was expanded to presumptive prayer: that's where one might pray for a specific thing to happen or essentially tell God how a situation should be resolved without understanding the full consequences if that prayer is answered.I did that once.  I prayed a certain prayer and  God quickly reprimanded me.  He impressed hard on me the consequences if my prayer were answered and pointed out all sorts of hurts and failures and wrongs that would be dealt a number of people I loved deeply.  Now in my mind, I was just certain that removing one person from the equation would improve every one's life in a wonderful way.  So real were all the things God pointed out would go awry if this happened that I sobbed for the hurt I'd very nearly caused my family.  I sincerely and deeply felt the conviction that I was wrong and begged forgiveness.   I had not seen the true consequences of that prayer being answered.  And do you know that years later that same individual was instrumental in trying to lead several of my family to Christ?  Praise God he halted me in my prayer and reprimanded me!  As difficult as people can be at times, I am very careful about what I'll pray over another since that day.I've learned I mustn't impose what I think into my prayer request. If it's just an obstinate opinion that starts up when I start to pray and will come up over and over again in my mind distracting me from focusing on a situation, then I'll just say, \"Lord, you know what I think...but I want your answer for this, because I know it's the very best thing.  YOU know better than I do and I know that.  I just need to shut this voice off in my mind.  Help me with this Lord, so I can better pray.\" I've learned to ask for understanding in an area where I pray.I don't always know what the root of a  situation is when I'm moved to pray for someone.  I ask God to reveal what needs to be known so I can pray rightly for that person.  This is not always pleasant in because sometimes what gets revealed can be painful (for me and my family), as was the case this past spring and summer when I could feel something was off with someone close to us.  Oh my!  What was revealed later was shocking and left me stunned and shaking...but it showed me most clearly that my prayers needed to be for a resolution of the situation and  forgiveness towards that individual and then to move out of God's way and let him work in that situation.  It's not always an unhappy reveal that occurs, however.  Many times, God has opened my understanding of a situation and enabled me to pray better prayers for the individuals concerned.Sometimes when I'm praying for a situation the answer isn't what I'd have wanted but I know that ALWAYS God's wisdom is greater than my own.  Last year when I was praying for Bess and Sam's new home, I had no idea that God's plan was to take them to the south end of Florida!  That one hurt. I recall how I was cleaning the bathroom at the time the call came from Sam telling me the news of his move.  Bess and I had just talked two days before, speaking of a home within an hour and a half of us.  I was so happy thinking of having them move closer.  As Sam told me how excited he was over this move,  I withheld my hurt from him as we talked, because who wants to rain on someone's happy parade?  When the call was done however, I lay my head down right where I was cleaning the toilet and sobbed and sobbed, repeating over and over, \"But I trust you, God, to know what's best.\"  It hurt me so to have yet another grandchild living far away.  And now God is moving them back towards us.  I didn't pray that over them but only prayed for what was best for them, as I do for all my children.  This time away is part of His plan for their lives.Prayer is sometimes a long term journey that requires  resting places.My former pastor's wife called me to ask me if I'd 'carry' her father in prayer.  She told me that she needed to let go of the situation and felt she'd been getting nowhere at all.  I immediately realized that she'd passed the baton to me in what was meant to be a marathon of sorts and so I accepted and carried her father for many months on my prayer list, until she came to me one day and said the situation had been resolved. 18 months ago I was so worn down by an ongoing prayer concern that I asked a pastor friend to carry my baton and explained to him why.  He was kind and thoughtful and took up my prayer concern for several months while I recuperated from the bitterness and hurt that the situation for which I'd been in prayer had rooted into my life.  Every time I was even tempted to pick up that concern, I'd remember, \"Ryan is covering that for me.\" and I'd change to another thought.  One morning I awoke and knew I was restored and rested enough to pick it up once again and I carried it forward until the situation broke.Sometimes the prayer  list I keep dwindles.  I have learned that in time God will fill it back up again.  A typical list these days has 30 or so individuals or items that I am praying for.  I have been down to just my family members sometimes for a month or two at a time but I see now that God 'rests' me before he rebuilds the list.  Eventually it will fill up and I'll find my page is filled once more.Prayer is not a solo journey.  The Bible assures us that a three fold cord is not easily broken.  Any time we can stand with another in prayer we are creating a strong cord.  The more people who stand with us in prayer the greater the strength of that cord becomes.I have learned to recognize Prayer Warriors.I don't always know someone well when I'm praying in agreement with them, but I generally know enough about them to know their prayers are genuine and constant.  How do I know this?  Because I see the fruit of their efforts.  I see how God is working in their lives.  I listen to what they say.  I see how they respond to the request for prayer.    It's not that their children are perfect and they appear moral and upright in their personal lives or how professional they are in their career life.  It's the way they proclaim God, and how they willingly approach prayer without telling me their advice for fixing a problem or saying \"Well...if it's God's will...\" about a situation that looks mighty impossible.  No, they get down on their knees and they pound on the doors of heaven and they cry out to God and they will do it again and again.  Had it not been for willing prayer warriors on May 28, 2015, I do not know if I'd be sitting here April 3, 2016 writing this post on prayer!!  I had bilateral pulmonary embolisms and had been having breathing problems for four days.  I should have died within seconds of hitting the floor in my kitchen.  I could have died at any point between home and the first ER some 25 minutes away or while in that ER, or on the 30 minute ride to the second hospital cath lab.  That's how dire the situation was.  Seconds counted.  I was passing in and out all that time.    I truly believe what changed the final outcome  was turning to John  at the cath lab when they said it would be an hour before they could do surgery and saying \"Tell Katie to go on my Facebook page and put out a call for every prayer warrior to pray for me now.\"   Every second that ticked by was counted against me until that moment.  After that call went out every second that passed was another victory of prayer.  If someone is quick to try and offer up solutions to 'fix' a situation, without first going before God, I know they won't pray in agreement with me.  They can't get out of their own way long enough to even go before God.  If someone tells me they meant to pray but 'forgot' and it happens on more than one occasion, I'm not likely to include them in my inner prayer circle of warriors.  A warrior responds to the call for service.  He doesn't wait around to see what else is coming along or dawdle on his way to the battle field.  I am fierce and I mean that.  I don't have time or patience with those who are half hearted.  Prayer is serious and very necessary and when a call for prayer arises it wants a ready response.I set aside time for prayer every day.Specifically, I pray each morning over my prayer list.  I prefer to do this immediately upon arising, as I sip my first coffee.  Given a choice of my daily study time or prayer time, I opt for prayer.  I can always find a moment later to study but that prayer time is specifically set aside for the purpose of my prayer ministry.   John and I pray each night before we go to sleep.  I may not mention every item on my prayer list at that prayer time but the list as a whole is often prayed over.And all through the day...Anytime I've taken time to pray first thing in the morning, I will have specific prays that pop up all through the day.  Homemaking is not such a mind occupying task that it pushes all other thoughts out of my mind.  The Bible says that we should pray all of the time, over every thing, and so I do.  Over the list of prayer needs, over shopping, over bills, over little annoyances and big concerns and people who aren't on my prayer list but who rest on my heart for a bit.  Prayer is an ongoing thing in my life and while I won't tell you it's constant in every minute, it is something that is ongoing, all through the waking hours and often in the night when I waken as well.I've learned a great deal in my times of prayer.Do you feel a call for prayer on your life?     Start with the Lord's Prayer found in Matthew 6:9-13.  Most of us know it by heart already but if you don't it's easily memorized.  It is an all encompassing prayer, covering your every need for the day.  Think about the words and what the prayer says.  Ask God to show you the fullness of that simple prayer and what each line means.  Dwell on that prayer for as long as you need to.  It teaches well how to pray for ourselves and for others.Another prayer I found helpful is the Jabez prayer in 1 Chronicles 4:10.  It too is an awesome prayer.Gradually, as you become comfortable in prayer, talk to God about needs in your life or in the lives of others.  Mention them by name, be specific about the area you want to cover in prayer.  Keep a list and notate answers and changes that occur.  Be prepared to be changed.How has prayer changed me?  It's enabled me see that God is active today.  He moves. He moves all the time but prayer has allowed me to watch Him move in specific and wonderful ways.  It's also made me understand that not every outcome is peaches and sunshine.  Sometimes hard things happen.  Babies are lost.  Loved ones die.  Healings don't happen.  I've learned that no matter what happens when I pray,  to respond continuously with \"God, I know you are good.  I trust you.  I don't always understand, but I trust you.\"  And in that trust I've learned to find peace.Well! March flew right past didn't it?  Actually it went no quicker than usual and there were indeed days when I thought it dragging along mighty slow like any other month.    Busy days helped time fly a little faster and having John home for two long weeks at a time with extra days off meant it felt a bit like vacation even if we didn't go anywhere.  I look back over March and am amazed I got as much done as I did, even if no 'to do' list was ever completely tended to.  April here started with a roar of thunder, lightning and enough rain to wash everything good and clean and then sparkle it up, too.  I know there was rough weather all about us, but we didn't even have a stiff breeze here through it all, and for that we're grateful.Now let me get busy replying to all of your comments over the past month.At least two posts for March were reposts.  They weren't meant to be reposts.  I was merely going in adding jump breaks to older posts and for some reason, after I've done that to several posts, one will suddenly decide it's all brand new and there it is right on the month's line up.  A 2012 post Menu plan was one such post which generated fresh comments from several of you.  Apparently it appeared as fresh to you as it felt itself to be.  On the Q&A post March 1, I spoke of Bess and Sam's loss.  Thank you all for your condolences and sympathy and prayers.  They are doing very well.  Bess decided to make a memory box for the baby and put in the first sonogram and a few other items that were special to her.  I think it was a lovely way to commemorate her baby's brief time of life and yes, I do consider a baby living from the moment it forms a heart beat.  There were some tough moments for her but I am certain that prayers helped her along the rougher places and brought her to a place where she can move forward.Now for some unknown reason, I apparently posted a second Q&A!  Who knows where my head was. I thought it a duplicate post but it reads as though it were current.  I don't know.  But since I did post it, I shall address those comments and ask Lana how are your parents doing?  Have any decisions been made yet?  I have you upon my prayer list...Gramma D posted that she'd been reading a post from November of 2011 here on the blog and what a lot of water under the bridge since then.  You are so right!  Major changes in my life since then and likely to be plenty more.  It was on this post that Lana and Kathy both sent a thank you to those of you who had been praying for their situations.  Kathy's husband found a new job and you all who prayed had a hand in the answer to their situation!Assigning Value #1 Beckyathome commented on her liking to have a stocked freezer and pantry.  Me too!  And it's a love Katie has as well though I think she's not as heavily stocked as she was once upon a time.  She was helping me unload and put away groceries here one day after a big shop with a lot of good sales.  She commented as she surveyed our one cabinet pantry at the time that she was sure it gave me a lot of comfort to see all that food, lol.  I think my pantry love goes back to the harvests we put up in the freezer and pantry shelves when I was growing up.  Having grown our own vegetables and foraged for berries and plums and such, Mama turned them into jams and jellies and preserves, home canned vegetables, and froze a load of things as well.  Both my grandmothers kept well stocked pantries and so it just seems natural to me to have several months worth of food on hand at once.I've always said my stocked pantry/freezer is a great emergency fund.  I've good reason to say this having had to rely on those two more than once in my adult life and it fed my family well during some mighty tough days.Karla, when we moved into this house, we had a 25cu.ft. fridge and the one that came with the house, a mere 14cu.ft.  It was our intent at the time to use the smaller fridge for beverages and additional freezer space and to use the larger fridge for our food fridge.  Ha.  Within two months the larger fridge died dead and would not be revived.  I crept along with that tinky 14cu.ft. freezer for another 14 years.  I cursed the lack of space, the way things tumbled out of it onto the floor anytime an item was needed, the lack of light (who makes a fridge without a light bulb inside?!).  At one point, John had told me I could get a new fridge and I danced about the kitchen with joy until he spoiled it all by commenting it would be worth just to not hear my constant complaints over the little fridge.  I was so ashamed I refused to go buy the much wanted new refrigerator and limped along with the apparently extremely well built little one.  I have a nice big refrigerator now because my son bought it for us as an anniversary gift after he got out of the Navy, using some of his separation pay to purchase it.  I was never so grateful or happy for a gift in my life, but I learned a lot about biting my tongue in the years between John's saying I could purchase a new fridge and the actual coming of a new fridge into my kitchen.  And by the way, that little fridge was given to a friend whose husband used it to store deer meat and fish after hunting and fishing trips.  It's still running...After I related my loathing for the cost of checks, this was shared in the comments.  If only our credit union had checking or if only our bank allowed a free box of checks!  Actually if our credit union even offered checking we'd likely do business more of our business with them,  but alas, they don't.Nancy said... This is a little late now, but maybe someone else can use the tip.  Our credit union gives 1 box of checks free to any members who are senior citizens, and I think they define sr. citizens as anyone over 55.  They don't offer, you have to ask.  Anyway, even if I don't need them right then, I ask each year and get a free box.  Worst they can do is say no and laugh.  That doesn't hurt my feelings. Loyda shared that she has a Facebook group called On the road to retirement...I went over to join today and my membership is pending at the moment.  It's a closed group  but I'm sure if you want to go by and try the group out, she'll be appreciative of the membership.Assigning post #2  I related my internet woes with the satellite company.  Well the story goes on.   The first month of the 'new and improved, greater gigabyte' service gave me a nasty nasty shock when the first billing arrived.  It was prorated for a partial month credit for the former service and prorated for a half month of the new service plus the next month's charges and zowie kapowie it hit hard, coming in at roughly double what we'd been paying for the lesser service.  I called right away and discovered that the next two months will be lower, the fourth month of service only a little higher than the coming two months.  Is it worth it?  John would tell you indeed it is, since he now enjoys videos without any buffering at all.  I have not yet braved the familiar Swagbucks routine due to other complications which have nothing to do with internet services.    I told John I'll just call it a massive entertainment fund I reckon, but I did strongly suggest that we seriously reconsider our satellite TV costs in August (or September)when the current contract ends because those costs are slowly amping up once more, now that all the discounts are expiring.Tammy, Susie @ persimmon moon cottage, and Judy all commented on the galvanized garden.  I love that look overall.  I have several more pieces of galvanized metal and am thinking I'd like to use them all along the back of the house.  I keep hoping to get to the grocery to buy herbs to plant in my pots which are currently a mishmash of plants that returned from last year's plantings.  I need more variety in height in the bed but I like my version well enough.  The milk container is a new addition (formerly kept inside my home) and I don't care for the watering can sitting atop it.  I'll work something else out with that in the near future.Sarah I don't have a Joanne store nearby.  I am wary of 'cheap' thread as I had a really difficult time with my machine not too long ago after buying inexpensive thread, nevertheless I shall keep my eyes open for notions at the thrift stores.  I am sure there must be some newer threads that come in from time to time, just as with any other hobby items.  I thought perhaps someone might have a mail order source.  I'll check Prudent Homemaker for any suggestions she might have since she does a lot of sewing for her girls.Heat wraps or heating pad for my ankles is one thing I have not thought to try.  I shall do that and see if I can get some relief when I overdo next time.  I am no fan of ice packs, I know that for sure!Pam I love the look of painted tires as planters, flower bed edging, etc.  I recall a great aunt whom I dearly loved.  Her house was a white cottage with red trim and she had two tires in her front yard that were split at the top into points and planted with red petunias.  She also had a huge weeping willow tree on the kitchen side of her house where the washing machine hose ran water.  It was lush and wonderful.  Anytime I see pictures of the tire planters I think of Aunt Johnny, lol!Assigning Value #3  Sparkiedoll (Rose), I know Charis  answered you but thought I'd explain why I refer to it as Harvest Day.  It's the end result of John's sowing of 'labor' into his job.  It is our harvest for the work he's done, and it allows us not only to pay our bills but to 'store it up' as we would any other harvest we might make.Charis how are you getting along with the leg healing?  You are still on my prayer list for this injury. I am praying little pain and fast healing for you.Lana  I wish my mind could grasp that I don't have to spend my grocery money just because it's there to spend, but it won't.   I generally will stock up in some area where we are low or in an area I've meant to increase but never have.  But yes, there are times when more groceries are just not necessary.  So hello to pet food, toiletries, paper items, etc. and much longed for pleasantries, like green Verde sauce or cooking sherry or cherry preserves.Judy so glad you enjoyed the strawberry cobbler.  It is a different flavor than uncooked berries.  I mean to make myself a strawberry cake this year.  Haven't had one in ages upon ages.Laurie, Lana, Anonymous, Debbie all mentioned Swagbucks.  I know they change up how you can earn about once every three months or so and sometimes it's easier to find the pattern of higher earnings.  John and I tried to use Shop and Earn today and I could not get the page to open to the store for love or fussing.  We finally just went directly to the store site.  I've had computer woes and no longer have Chrome so no Swagbutton any more either.  That meant not even a default Shop and Earn this time.  I think it's just time for me to take a season off and return later and see how it goes then.Lana so terribly sorry about the young police officer in your community.  I kept that prayer request on my list for weeks.I shared this recipe with Gramma D privately but the pimento cheese I mention is easy:  Just grate 2 cups cheese, add 1 2ounce jar of diced pimentos (or roasted red peppers but I prefer pimentos) juice and all and enough mayonnaise to moisten and make a paste you can spread on sandwich bread.  This is good stuffed into celery, or on bread and toasted as well as a sandwich filling.  Karla you asked for this recipe so pay attention here.Assigning Value #4 Sarah  shared this tip:  \"We got ants in our sugar container and dog food too when we were first married. Grandmother told us to put the container , undisturbed in the sun outside. Do not shake or move the contents at all.  When the heat hit the canister the ants started running out without us doing a thing.  I would not leave the crunchy dog food out long though as it contains oils I think.  Out in the sun the ants left and no new ones got in during the process either.  It surprised us that it worked so well.\"      I will certainly be trying this in the future!!Sparkiedoll shared this:    https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bubble_and_squeakLeftover mashed potatoes and cabbage can only mean 'Bubble and Squeak' Yum, yum, yum!  Best wishes, Rose (Kent UK)beckyathome too often the savings is more a matter of shifting money from here to there, but it's nice to have real savings that we can actually add to the savings account!In My Home This Week, post #1 or This Week in My home.  Apparently I need to really watch that title post as I keep switching the words up.  Pam, I love the image of you with arms raised welcoming the honking geese as they flew over!Karla, I hope you do use your Grandpa's wheelbarrow as a flower planter.  You are perfectly right in that it's just sitting there anyway.  Use it, enjoy it and be glad you took the time to put it to good use!Post #2  in which I reverse the words in the post title...Karla I do have the wallboards with vinyl wallpaper on them.  As for holes, we spackle them and sand down.  Mostly I try to reuse nail holes if I possibly can but sometimes I can't.   John does not complain, but he then again he doesn't feel the walls need painting so it's all one and the same in the end.  Sparky136 I have that first of the morning reading with my Bible study and it's a sweet time each day.  I did make real time to read this month, usually about 9pm, and I have enjoyed that time.Lana shared this:  There are printable botanicals suitable for framing here-http://emilyaclark.com/2016/03/ready-to-print-gallery-wall-fern-botanicals.htmlhttp://emilyaclark.com/2016/03/ready-to-print-gallery-wall-fern-botanicals.html Post #3  I love reading the comments and learning new phrases from varying regions.  Sparky136 speaks of 'Dogwood winter' and Lana mentions the 'blackberry cold snap'...All to say that the weather is undecided in Spring, lol, but I do love these two phrases...Rhonda, I know what you mean about the new recipes.  I really do want to make new recipes (and did try two new ones in March that were very good and I will happily share.Georgene/ Living On Less Money blog asked about my schedule for running errands.  I shared my answer on the comments but will reprint here:I TRY to do errands just one day a week. It's not a set day of the week due to John's rotating schedule and I don't always succeed in having it just one day if he's home.  It is inevitable that if I have something that wants doing he's going to give in to perhaps half and I've half left undone.  I just try hard to batch errands as often as I can and stay home as much as I can because after all, if I'm at home I get a lot more done than when I'm gadding about! Post #4  Joann Baker I hope your hand is doing just great by now.  I've had you on my prayer list as well.Karla your daughter has been on the prayer list as well.Miriam thank you for stopping in to read!Coffee and Tea chat posts were used this month depending upon weather at the time.  First post was coffee   I mentioned my frustrations with Facebook.  I was prompted by the revelation that we were using data every time we logged onto Facebook to severely edit my list of friends.  This did not entirely fix my woes.  I was still getting posts from people whom I 'liked' but had chosen not to 'follow'.  Well in the end, I had to unfriend a few.  I usually end up unfriending a few I never meant to as well but it was very refreshing to find how lightened I felt with some of the aggravation gone.I think we are all of one mind about Facebook and photos of abused/killed animals and political leanings.  Janell, I unfollowed people multiple times and facebook would continue to show me their posts.  Unfriending sometimes helped...sigh.  But as I said, my woes are currently reduced.Chat Post #2  Angela  I am on a good sleep pattern at the moment.  I think the sound machine has helped  for the most part.  It was bad enough at one point in March that John prayed over me one night reminding God we had a guest in the guest bed and I'd have nowhere to retreat for sleep if I had to get up, lol.  I think the Turkey curry and the Squash casserole both sound really good!  Please do share them next Tried and True, which is coming up this week.Shell Abuse of any substance or any thing causes an unnatural balance in a relationship.  Kathy Yes!  The stick on the mantel is the one I used in going up and down the side of the mountain on our vacation a couple  of years ago.Tammy My own father, when my mother finally told him she'd had enough and wanted a divorce if he didn't give up his beer drinking, told my mom she'd never leave...and he'd never quit beer.  She did leave and divorce him, but still never addressed the issues that kept her in the marriage for years too long.  My dad did eventually stop drinking, but only after cancer prevented his leaving the house.The last comment on this post was left anonymously and I have great sympathy for what you must have been through.  However, I have to share this.  The point of forgiveness is not for the sake of those who abused and harmed you.  It is for the purpose of healing YOU, because it allows you to at last lay down the bitterness and hurt and hate that keeps you forever tied to the ones who hurt you something that 'forgetting' alone can't do. Coffee Chat #3  Sparky136 A belated happy birthday wish.  And how fortuitous it was that we had birthday cake on your birthday!Kip You reminded me that at one point I'd thought to try and match the chain that attaches the straps.  I have looked for twill straps to match with no luck.  BUT if all else fails perhaps I can find some sturdy print fabric to cover the straps.  The purse is perfectly good, except for those ratty straps.Rhonda I too get tired of reading about 'side hustles' aka the young bloggers speak of earning something extra on the side.  I suspect you are quite right.  Being frugal is my strength and while the $35 or so a month is nice I can probably 'find' that too within my budget by doing some sort of savings.Sarah My favorite was a pale green velvet bodice and dotted Swiss skirt with the same green.  Really lovely.Joanne Baker  Thank you.  I feel better since I'm not the only Gramma who didn't do anything, lol.Tammy  I imagine a basket of fruit was a great temptation to you all.  Aren't children funny about wanting what isn't theirs?Lana shared this.  I don't have a Kmart anywhere near me, but some of you might:Just saw this on hip2save.com.  Ball quart jars 12 pack at K Mart for $5.99!  I remember you saying that you need jars.  What a deal! The Tried and True Recipes to Share post was so successful this past month I'm going to repeat it this month.  I have tried a new recipe and pulled out a couple of old ones that I hadn't made in awhile that are worthy of sharing.  I hope you all will join in as you did last time.  If you haven't checked out the recipes do so.  I'm pinning a few to try this coming month for my own menu plans.That wraps up another Q&A!  Looking forward to comments for April."},
{"title": "This Week In My Home:  April Dreams", "date": null, "text": "This week in my home:...this is what April 1 looked like in our yard...although the photo is not from that day it looked just like it all the same.  I thought how appropriate April came in with the promised April showers and storms to shake things loose, though we had none of the wind or damage others about us saw.  I am grateful for that.  Today, of course, it's all sunshine and blue skies and much cooler air, too.   It's gorgeous out there!Remember when I said I was sure my guest room should be company ready?  I did just what I'd said I'd do and got it cleaned up and set up a table that can hold a suitcase up off of the floor.  Good thing.  I had a text from Bess asking if she and Sam might come up next week to go house hunt.  And right in time as they got the first offer on their home this past week.  So glad I minded myself and went to work on that guest room!  I'll look it over well before they arrive, but that room is ready for company, far more ready than it was when our unexpected guest arrived.John returns to a normal enough work schedule for now, but I confess I've mostly enjoyed these long weeks of him at home, much as it was before his schedule changed to 24/72s.   My problem is that I always tend to treat these long weeks as a sort of holiday and I rise later and later and start my day's work later as well, sometimes not until afternoon.  Discipline is wanted in this area and I must start to rise consistently at a set time each morning and begin my days aright.  Mornings are truly my strength and the time of day when I can accomplish the most.  Not to mention that on those days when John makes plans I can truly accomplish all needed tasks well before we're ready to leave home.  He'll work two days this coming week and that means I'll be up plenty early enough at least 4 mornings.  No excuse for not getting loads done this week nor for not having a good morning's work behind me all week long.  I hope that means I knock a good bit of my work list out this week....I plan mealsI have enchiladas on my mind.  Namely because I have a huge packet of corn tortillas to use up and it's my opinion that corn tortillas never freeze well unless they are filled.  My favorites will go on the menu this week and I'll make extra for the freezer. I expect I'll end up making some beef ones as well, but I'll use ground beef.  As always, I'll start with what we ate on Shabat.  Several new to me recipes (or ones I've tried but haven't used in ages) are all from the same cookbook, BH&G Good Food On A Budget, a thrift store find that has been on my bookshelf for some time.  I plan to cook as many of the recipes as I can in it, so expect to see a few of them here in the next month.Meatloaf, Onion Roasted Potatoes, Italian Flat Beans, Salad, Pineapple Upside Down CakeLeftovers for meRice Stuffed Chicken*, Asparagus, Salad with Strawberries, Blue Cheese and AlmondsI did not have one of the key flavor ingredients (mucho important to the dish) so I stuffed chicken with lemon and onion.  I took brown rice from the freezer and made a pilaf with lemon zest, onion and almonds.  Asparagus roasted in the oven.Chicken Enchiladas Verde, Kidney Bean Bowl*, Upside Down Cake Chili Beef Potato Soup*, Corn Muffins, Salad with Carrots, Raisins and Nuts, Pineapple Upside Down Cakeout with MamaSavory Chicken Pot Pies*, Honey Glazed Carrots, Steamed Broccoli,  Coleslaw... I plan my work for the week:I have pictures ready to hang on the front entry wall.  It will take John to get them up but I'm going to 'remind' him they need hanging.  Not nag...didn't wait on John...did it myselfBooth...I still haven't been in and I'm determined to make it this week.  I mean to work on tags/items today and have it all bagged and ready to take into town with me on Thursday or Friday when the store is open.I have a last bag of books to deliver to the Women's Club for resale.  I'll try to do this Wednesday when I'm in town.  If only the flea market were open on that day, too! Found a short stack behind a chair.  Added those to the bag, too.Hem the curtain in the master bath.  I trimmed it to length when I bought it and bought thread to hem it a couple of weeks ago.  Sorry to say I then forgot the hemming needed to be done.  With windows open Saturday the curtain blew and the end raveled a little more.Pantry freezer inventory to check expire dates on items and rotate as needed. 4-4 Back pantry and freezer done.Noticed a world of privet coming up under a tree here in the yard.  Past experience has taught me to get it up quick. I roughly half of it pulled up.  I don't know if I'll be able to bend over tomorrow or not...Everything else is, like booth work, from last week;Move plants, spread mulch.Clean under stove hood.Spray paint something...It was too windy and later too rainy. Nope...I forgot to buy primer, which is needed as the pieces I have paint for are metal and have small rust spots....I will have fun:I have several issues of April magazines to read, both modern day and vintage.  Some portion of each day will be spent reading them and my current books...yes multiple books, two at present.4-5 While I scanned new vintage photos to use with this blog, I read a lovely story by Faith Baldwin in one of the magazines.  Nice!Out to dinner with Mama.Going to town to purchase herbs for the back flower pots. Moved the rosemary and found parsley and basil seed which I planted.  Will see how well those take.Have coffee and music mid-afternoon.  Sadly, I'm finding most of my records were very nearly played to death years ago and are full of scratches and skips.  I'm going to get rid of the very worst ones, much as it pains me.John played guitar one afternoon after we'd had nachos and soda (he even measured out my portion..so sweet!).  Another afternoon we had iced tea and crackers with cheese while chatting.  I could quickly make this mid afternoon snack and ease thing a permanent feature in my life.I promised myself a manicure last week and then didn't do it.  Several years ago I had a word of knowledge for a friend.  I told her that God wanted her to be rooted...If only I'd had a full understanding of what that word meant!  Banning Liebscher has certainly increased my understanding of what it means to be rooted and how important the root system of our faith is to our growing and producing fruits of the Spirit.The author explains why a good strong root system is so necessary to growth of a productive Christian.  He teaches through scripture and his own life examples.   He states that the strong growth relies upon three types of 'soil': intimacy with God, service to others, and community.  He clearly states this in the first chapter of the book.  The next five chapters deal with conditioning yourself for the initial 'planting', namely trusting God and developing that trust to the point that you can truly have a personal relationship with him.  It means getting out of our own way and allowing God to build the proper environment for our growth.The second part of the book deals with the three soils mentioned in the first chapter and how vital each of them are to proper growth and strength to begin to bear the fruit of what God has planted within you.The book is not difficult to understand, nor is it very long, just 12 chapters.  It is comprehensive and well written and well explained.  I'll be reading this one again so that I can dig just a bit deeper than I did in the first reading.  It will find it's place on my shelf of books to read again and again.This book was supplied for review by Blogging for Books."},
{"title": "Assigning Value to What I Do:  Lovely Lovely Days", "date": null, "text": "Mar 26:  Rinsed out bread sacks to reuse for storing meat in the freezer.  Tomorrow I will hang them in the laundry area to dry out thoroughly.  I usually fold them flat and store in a lidded box so they can easily be retrieved and stay neat as well.Meal prep today took all of 10 minutes and that included making a salad and pudding as well as mixing cornbread and starting rice.  I had already combined the wet ingredients and stashed them in the fridge, had the cornmeal and rice sitting on the counter, had washed salad greens.  Amazing how much time these small steps saved today. I mixed up the pudding and divided into four servings right away: two sherbet cups for today, two lidded 1/2 cup containers for later in the week.  I made lemon pudding and grated the zest of a lemon into the pudding mixture, which pushed the flavor up just a tiny bit without giving it that sharp lemon taste I love and John detests.Stretched a meal really though the intent wasn't stretching but decreasing the spiciness.  I served Brunswick Stew over brown rice portions.  I put two containers of rice into the freezer, 1 1cup portion and 1 1/2cup portion.  I also put almost a pint of leftover stew into the freezer.  That will be my meal one day when John isn't at home.Immediately bagged up and put the leftover cornbread into the freezer.  It's prefect for making crock pot stuffing a little later down the road.Today's snack: stove top popped corn.It was cool outdoors and so when the AC kicked on we decided to push it up another degree.  It hasn't come back on since then.Used water left in a bottle to water three plants.Mar.  27:  We had our traditional holiday breakfast of canned sweet rolls and little sausages.  I had the sausages in the freezer, bought on sale back when they were 3/$10 which saved about $2 over the non-sale price.We did not travel to church this morning since we knew that record crowds were expected.  We listened to the sermon via live stream, saving the gasoline we'd have used to make that trip, not to mention soda and a Sunday paper...savings of $10We had dinner at home eating from the freezer.  Both entree and fruit salad came out of the freezer. After dinner I washed a full load of dishes.  I checked to be sure the heat dry was OFF and air dried the load when it was done.I worked on the bill box and balanced the check book.  I decided, while writing out bills, to continue to set aside the money I'd formerly put aside for the loan.  For whatever length of time we are not making payments that money can be set aside and go into savings (savings $100/month).  If we find we need to renew the loan we won't have to strain to make room for the payment each month, as we'll be accustomed to setting it aside.Decided today was the day to cull those books.  I culled hard and really seriously considered how long I'd been meaning to read some of those books.  It was not as difficult as I'd thought.  I think I pulled somewhere close to three dozen off my shelves.  And no it didn't leave me room for new books.  It just left me with full bookshelves instead of shelves double loaded with books.  They will be donated to the local Women's Club who put on an annual book sale here in town each year.Cleared my dresser drawers and closet and tried on every.single.thing.  I have a bag of clothes to donate, a drawer in my dresser for out of season clothes that fit and clothes that will fit very nicely in 5-10 pounds.  I organized my clothing by colors and put back into the closet.  I culled purses and checked shoe boxes (nothing there to donate) and scarves (let go of 1 that just didn't suit me).  Now I can better tell what I can mix and match and what I might need if I come across a good buy on something.  I'll b better able to put together outfits for Spring.It was a quiet day at home overall.  John stumbled upon a  movie called \"Job\" and another after called \"Ruth\" and then \"God's Compass\", all good films well worth watching.  The first two were a modern retelling of the Bible books by the same name.  They were well done.Mar. 28:  I am very low on bread and really wanted to avoid the store, since we've not been in the grocery in two full weeks (Woot Woot!!  That represents a savings of nearly $40).  I looked at the options on hand and decided we might as well use the extra bagels we had on hand for breakfast bread.Last night I set out to thaw: a beef roast, a pound of chicken wings (was meant to be breasts but I found the wings and made different menu for that day).  I took a gallon of milk from the back freezer this morning.I didn't have time to do the prolonged cooking the chicken wings required.  I dug in the freezer and pulled out the other half of the Corn Moussaka I made last week and put that in the oven to heat while I continued working. Washed the kitchen and laundry area curtains.  I hung them on the line to dry.After dinner, John and I drove down to his work place to pick up his check.  We took off trash, took books to the library (drop off point for Women's Club books), picked up his check, did our banking, dropped off bills at the post office, picked up parts at the auto parts store in town, and on our way back in, picked up the mail.On the way home, John asked if I'd made plans for supper.  I had...but asked if he had any ideas, because generally when he asks, he does.  His idea was \"A Big T-Bone and Baked Potato!\"  That's a far cry from a skimpy little chicken sandwich!  He thought we'd go by the local grocery but I suggested a compromise.  I knew I had a nice New York Strip in the freezer from our trip to the meat market.  I didn't have baking potatoes but I did have some nice multi-colored potatoes (red/white/yellow/ purple) to pan fry.  Could I thaw a steak in less than two hours?  I have a trick for quick thawing.  I put the frozen item on a cast iron pan and set it on the stove burner.  I have a gas stove and the pilot lights emit a very low warmth.  The temperature of the pan picks up that little bit of heat and the meat quick thaws.  Yes, I had my steak practically thawed in two hours and ready to cook.  The savings today?  The cost of a steak and two potatoes, $20.There was another savings today.  I had planned to iron the kitchen curtains.  I'd hung them on the line and the wind snapped and popped them until they were as fresh and crisp as newly starched curtains might have been.  There were no wrinkles and no need to iron.  I liked that savings most of all.Once curtains were up again, I totted up the checkbook.  John's extra half shifts have helped tremendously and it was easy to set aside the money I'd hoped to for savings.  It was also helpful when I received a bill from the hospital stay last year.  I was able to make a decent sized payment on that bill.Last fall when the snapdragons were blooming, I made a point to let some of the flower heads go to seed and shook them out on the soil.  Payoff this spring in a bumper crop of healthy plants. If the first one blooming is any indication, they shall be super lovely this year.Mar. 29:  For the first time in ages upon, I stuck hard to my planned grocery budget and even brought home a few dollars.  I was so happy!  I'll stick that back in a hidden spot to use one of those weeks when we don't have quite enough.  I think I got all the milk, bread, produce I shall need for the coming two week period.Oh and that grocery budget covered a sandwich each for our lunch today.  Since I had my episode of low blood sugar the other week John insists I eat within the proper time range.I'd planned to purchase a Horseradish cheddar for sandwiches later this week and thought I'd buy it at the deli at the big grocer.  I looked over the dairy case hard at Aldi and found a small block of the cheese for less than $2, savings $4.Aldi also had brown bags of bulbs.  I got one of Dahlias to put in pots here in the yard and the other has bleeding heart, lily of the valley and Astibille.  I hope these last three will have enough to share with Katie as well but if not they should multiply and then I can share them.John mowed our lawn today.  A yard in town costs $40 per mowing.  We keep about 2 acres mowed and must mow along the main driveway as well since our property fronts the road.  John saves us TONS of money each year because he does this job himself.  He long ago paid for his big riding mower with what he saved over the years.  This mower has been long lasting but his dream mower is a zero turn one.  I've made up my mind that next mower, he shall have what he wants. I made coffee at home for us, instead of us stopping to purchase a cup.  When John asked if I wanted a drink to go with my sandwich, I declined.  I had a bottle of cool water in the car and I knew I'd left it sitting in the shade.Mar. 30:  I slept in a little longer than usual this morning and failed to get my feet under me until well into the morning.  I realized that work was going to lag today and I might as well just marshall my thoughts and ideas of what I'd get done.  A trip to the porch proved it was too windy to spray paint today so I decided to skip that today.  It was so late when I finally determined I must do something that I decided kitchen work was the best use of my time.  I made dinner for us: Teriyaki Chicken Wings, Green Salad with Pineapple and Cottage Cheese on top, and Lima Beans.  That meal was a substitute for the Hawaiian chicken kebabs I'd meant to make after I found no bell peppers at Aldi this week.  Helped by the fact that I'd thawed chicken wings and not breasts!I put a beef roast in the oven while the chicken wings cooked.  I'll slice it thin for sandwich meat.  One of my planned meals this week will do for home or picnic and will use the roast.I made a quick cheese sauce and cooked whole wheat pasta and made up two pans of Macaroni and Cheese.  One went into the freezer for a future meal.  The other into the fridge.  We'll have it for dinner in the next day or two.I saved the sauce that was in the pan with the chicken.  It had cooked with the chicken and was thick and nice.  A shame to toss it I thought, so I bottled it up and put in the freezer.  It will be sauce for chicken another time in the future, or be used in a stir fry or fried rice recipe as added flavor.I put all my leftovers into a basket in the fridge so I'll know we must use them up within the week.  As I dug in the fridge looking at the various containers, I came across one of those \"Help I've fallen behind other things and you haven't seen me\" items.  There was a full bag of lovely green jalapenos.  One pepper had a tiny spot on it where it was starting to go bad but the rest were still fresh and green.  I seeded those and put them in the freezer for future use.  We don't use a lot of jalapenos but I like them in pico de gallo or homemade salsa and now and then in a dish that might be bland otherwise.  Keeping them in the freezer means I always have some on hand.  Savings $2.49.John got a rather cool item from a ministry that is metalwork.  It's a cross over a Star of David and it really is a beautiful item.  I loved it but when he proposed hanging it on the wall I was stumped.  This afternoon I was standing in the doorway of his music room and saw a picture I'd bought for him ages ago at the thrift store: David sitting on a hilltop playing his harp to the sheep in the meadow.  I love that piece and it just happens to be full of the same blues and greens and grays that we currently are using in the living room anyway.  I asked if I could borrow that picture to hang here in the living room.  We hung the Star of David/Cross directly above it.  I think it's lovely together.We changed out the ink cartridges on the printer.  It's been telling us for months that it was low but today it just wouldn't print any longer.  As it happened, I bought new cartridges last month but we've gone four months since the first warning message...Not sorry I waited, just amazed at how much longer we went until change was absolutely necessary.  Tomorrow will be my last day doing the monetary values on things I do for a little while.  Of course, I'll still be doing my frugal posts and doing the savings that generates those posts but I find that doing these monetary value posts can really bog the mind down.It's easy to get so focused on whether something has a big value that we might be tempted to forgo the little things that save mere pennies, as well as the things that we do because they give us pleasure.  I don't ever want to apologize for spending my funds on something that I truly enjoy nor should you.  I want to keep things in perspective.  By the same token, I'm glad I've done this over the past three months because it's easy to forget that we really are saving money as we tend to our home tasks, the things that we do every day and repeat over and over again, and that we are good stewards of the blessings that come our way.  Mar. 31:  Today I used three items from the leftovers basket.  I am especially proud that this month I have tossed only a few mushrooms and that small bit of cabbage/carrots left from the corned beef dinner.  I simply lost them in the fridge and it was too late to salvage.  Still, we're talking perhaps 1 cup of food tossed this month and that is a record low for me.  Both breakfast and supper used leftovers.John and I planned a day away from home.  Did we pack a picnic?  Nope, but I did grab my coupons which netted us a dinner for two for $9 which he paid for out of his pocket money.  The sandwiches I made up from the roast beef were put in the freezer for another time.  My little roast was sliced super thin by hand, and made into sandwiches last night, which we had for supper and then I made up six more sandwiches.We spent the morning rambling through a huge Antiques Mall that is no more than 20 minutes from home.  It was fun to walk about and look and look.  I wasn't tempted by much because the prices there are a little steeper and I tried to be very specific in what I was looking for: something to complete the living room wall, something for the front porch decor.  I found nothing for either one.  I did buy a book, a vintage scarf, and a pretty blue pottery planter.  I will see about getting some ivy or other greenery to go into that later.  I came away having spent just $14.98 and that was from my pocket money.  Oddly, John spent the exact same amount from his pocket money.From there we drove to the big city so that John could get guitar strings.  Again, he paid for those out of his pocket money.  I asked to stop in at the big Ross for Less.  I found a black maxi skirt and a pretty green shirt. I had torn a page from a catalog and planned to order a black maxi. Their price was $39.99...savings $20.  I paid just $10.99 for the one purchased today. I looked hard for pants but the skirt was as near as I could come to black pants and I think I'll get as much use from it.  It will be nice for summer wear I think.  Of course, I paid for my pieces out of my pocket.  I found a set of sheets, too, 100% cotton this time, cotton percale which is what I prefer. I typically pay $35 a set at Ross for Less.  I saved $22.  I purchased those with money from the house fund.John stopped at a gas station on our way home to buy cups of coffee.  This was very good coffee, a Peruvian roast and rivaled the coffee at any of the Name coffee shops.It rained on us on the way home.  I set the potted petunias under the runoff from the roof to get watered when we came in.You know the routine...we combined as many errands as we could when we left home.  Stopped and picked up mail, took off trash, went by the post office (bought stamps, mailed a letter) before actually heading off to our fun day.for last days of March, savings total: $220.49For March as a whole: $3,333.46For 1st quarter of this year:  $12,235.47Well there you have it.  Admittedly this is not a completely accurate figure.  I don't know how to figure interest saved in paying off the loan early, nor did I count the penny savings things (washing baggies, combining errands, using the oven to cook more than one item, adding humidity to the air to make it feel warmer than it was, saving bread sacks to package up meats, etc.).  I didn't count savings in doing my own pedicure the other day, nor the savings in moving plants I already have rather than simply buying new ones.  But there is no doubt that a dedicated homemaker can create a substantial financial contribution to the household just in doing the every day tasks.April 1:  I touched up some frames and replaced the backing on another item.  These will be hung in our entryway.  It was done at no cost to me, using what I had on hand.  I needed bread crumbs.  I had some bread slices I'd dried.  Easy enough to make crumbs by crushing those.Used up the last of a can of pineapple chunks and made a Pineapple Upside Down Cake.  I used the pineapple juice for most of the milk called for in the recipe.  No maraschino cherries on hand, so I used pecan halves.  The cake turned out very pretty.I noted the bananas had ripened rapidly despite being put in a zippered plastic bag.  I went ahead and used the pineapple cake bowl  to make banana bread.  I put the bread in the oven with the cake.  The banana bread went into the freezer for a future date.When making meatloaf for tomorrow's dinner, I found that an onion had spoiled and several others were starting to spoil.  I chopped those and put them in the freezer.  I double bagged them to keep them from smelling in the freezer.Planned my month by setting up my calendar, setting goals and putting the new quarterly budget sheet in my budget section.Warmed leftover broccoli to go with our dinner.  I reheated some butter beans as well.  That cleared the fridge of all leftovers from this week."},
{"title": "Coffee Chat:  A New Season", "date": null, "text": "It looks like a birthday cake doesn't it?  And I suspect from the clearness of that brew it's tea, but that's okay with you isn't it?   I bought a Peach Green Tea a couple of weeks ago on sale.  I liked it well enough.  I confess having had black teas all my life, a green tea tends to look 'weak' in my opinion but I know some really prefer it.  I think it will make a lovely iced tea this summer.  But that is another season isn't it?I have seasons on the mind at the moment.  There are all sorts in this world you know: spiritual, physical, natural, emotional.  There are seasons of plenty and seasons of drought.  There are age related seasons.  There are seasons for prayer and for answered prayers. Right now I feel very strongly that this is a new season in my life but I haven't quite pinned it down to tell you what season that might be.  It doesn't feel like a physical nor natural season.  But there are, as with all seasons, little signs of the new season. I've been unable for nearly two weeks to make any headway at all with Swagbucks. I have counted on that small earnings each month but as of right now I'm not even one tenth of the way to the next gift card and this month is nearly done. I tried hard last week but I missed the daily window for the work to go quickly and smoothly.  We spent a whole morning and portion of the afternoon away from home one day.  Then we had unexpected company come in to stay and it's just rude to sit for an hour or two on the computer while a guest is with you, or so I think.  I tried to work while he and John visited all the next day/afternoon but it was no use. The day company left I was ready to jump right on Swagbucks and did and my computer locked down.  I mean to the point that Windows wouldn't even open!  I worked all day long with the thing and finally was able to  restore the  previous settings.  I thought I understood what caused it, but it was an all day process to get it fixed.  By then it was end of the day and time for Shabat.  I've made it a point to do no surveys nor Swagbucks on Sabbath, so no point in even trying.  I am convinced I'm meant to let that go for now.  I've already stopped doing NFS surveys due to some crediting problems that went uncorrected despite repeated requests.   John stopped drinking Coke products and switched to Diet Rite.  Coke points are rare birds these days and I finally entered in all that Tammy sent me.  I have points to spend for a $10 gift card, but any new earnings will be extremely slow to add up to that amount again... these were all my little earnings venues besides the booth which is more miss than hit.  So I'm wondering just what is in my near future for earning pin money?"},
{"title": "In My Home This Week:  Lovely Spring", "date": null, "text": "In my home this week, I......am appreciating the new season.   And I don't just mean the new season in the natural world...Do you ever have the feeling you've crossed over a milestone somehow?  Not a birthday, nor an anniversary, nor a move or anything like that has occurred, yet something feels brand new and different.  It's a funny sort of feeling when you can't see the change, or count it off, but I can still tell that something is definitely different than it was before.  It will be interesting to see what manifests in this new season in life.I have been watching in awe as God answers prayers of many.  Kathy reports that her husband found a new job  which is great news.  I sat down earlier this week and noted ten items of prayer had been answered in the past two weeks, which is mighty awesome.  I guess God means for me to keep right on praying as he added two to my list last week.  It's very reassuring to see that this small ministry of prayer is something He will pay attention to.In the meantime, the natural season has been predictably all over the place.  Last week we had frost...twice!   It made me awfully glad I hadn't planted anything and that much more impatient to do so.  Especially with three and four time weekly bulletins from Katie who spies something new growing in her yard with each passing day. I think I'm just gonna start each day with \"Oh What a Beautiful Morning!\" and end each one with \"Oh What A Beautiful Day!\".  It's all so lovely, every single thing."},
{"title": "Assigning Value to What I Do:  Spring Is Here", "date": null, "text": "Mar 19:  Earlier this week I emptied the freezer of all the odds and ends of bread and combined them into one bag (what wasn't used for French Toast).  I washed out the bread sacks and hung them to dry and then turned them inside out and dried them some more.  Now they are folded nice and flat and stored in a box where I can pull them out next time I want to put meats up in the freezer.  So much less expensive than using a zippered freezer bag and I can double or triple up as needed if I'm worried about leaks.  Mostly I store like items together and then put those in a heavier duty plastic bread  sack.Cooked our corned beef today and as soon as I'd glazed it, I determine the best way to slice it so that it could be cut thinly and not shred.  Across the grain is always best and the meat slices beautifully well.  We'll have plenty of sandwich meat and perhaps another meal of corned beef from this piece of brisket.Leftover mashed potatoes went into the fridge for potato pancakes, which makes a terrific side dish for beef steak or roast.I had a wedge of cabbage leftover as well.  I'm sure I can stir fry that with some other vegetables for a side dish.I mixed up some lovely muffins with diced apples, soft raisins and chopped walnuts.  I topped with a little streusel topping.  They are really good and tasty and seem more substantial with all the lovely fruit in them.Our AC has remained at 76F.   If it begins to get the least little stuffy we turn on the oscillating fan (the ceiling fans are already going) and this helps make it feel much cooler.  So much cooler that I'm sometimes tempted to turn the AC to 78F but I know John would feel it right away.  As it is, he's the first to turn on the fan!"},
{"title": "Menu Monday - Week 3 Pantry Freezer Challenge", "date": null, "text": "This past week proved busy and I ate out three times.  Gasp!  I know!  Three times.  I didn't pay for a single meal and at least twice I brought home half a plate of food to use as a second meal.    It was frugal enough but you know I kinda missed my home cooking.  However,  those meals I didn't make last week will fill our menus later this month.The pantry challenge is proceeding very well.  I've added quite a bit of stock to the freezer and pantry cupboards.  We've limited our usage to pretty much dairy and produce. I've even added to our freezer with some of the foods I've prepared. Yesterday I added a large serving of Chicken Fried Rice and 16 egg rolls.  I'll be adding more oranges this week and strawberries for future jelly making and sundae topping. Check out the end of the menu for my planned baking  to see what else I mean to add to my freezer.The first meal I'm going to share this week is one I actually ate last week, but it was so good I just have to share it.  As for the rest of the week, I need to make a batch of broth to keep in the freezer...but first I want to cook the turkey breast that's in the freezer so I can toss that carcass in with the rest of them.  John will be happy.  He really likes turkey.Fish Tacos, Corn, Strawberry SundaeI used fish fillets from our meal out last week to make fish tacos.  They were tastier than I thought they might be, and in future I might not wait to have leftover fish!  I fried corn tortillas into taco shells, filled with sliced fried fish fillet pieces, savoy cabbage, shredded cheddar and chopped tomato.  I used Thousand Island dressing on mine but the local Mexican place uses Ranch dressing.  Roast Turkey, Scalloped Potatoes, 24 Hour Layered SaladI like to make my scalloped potatoes from scratch.  This week I have no potatoes.  I'm debating whether I will buy a bag or not.  It really depends upon sales this week.  Otherwise I'll likely use a box of dehydrated Au gratin potatoes.   We like the layered salad as a change from the usual tossed salad.  It holds up well if you use a sturdy lettuce such as romaine in it.  You can vary the toppings from to suit your family.  Cheeseburgers, Lettuce, Tomato and Onion plate, Cinnamon Baked BeansI haven't made cheeseburgers in a while and I 'm sure John's more than ready for a good burger.  I'll make my own rolls for this.  Have you ever tried adding a bit of cinnamon to your baked beans?  You really should try it, it adds depth and richness to the bean dish and everyone raves about it.Turkey Tetrazzini,  Green Beans with Almonds, Crusty Italian BreadI like this dish and we haven't had it in a long time.  The hard part will be to make enough for two and not six!  I like to have mushrooms but it isn't necessary.  I'll add a bit of lemon juice to the green beans.  Cowboy Chili, Coleslaw, Biscuit BreadI'm sure to have leftover beans and will thaw extra ground beef to make cowboy chili, a simple dish that people tend to love: browned ground beef, a little onion, canned pork and beans (we use vegetarian) and ketchup.  That's it!  Men and kids will eat this simple dish right up.  Mama always served this with biscuit bread. I'll make a very small biscuit bread and use the rest of my dough creatively...Turkey Club Salad Plates, Croutons, Brownie SundaesI'll use turkey slices, cooked turkey bacon to make our salad for this meal.  Homemade croutons from our Italian bread loaf will top the salad.  Any dressing you choose will be delicious on this salad.           Roast Beef, Green Peas with Mushrooms, Wild Rice, RollsI plan to buy meats this week to stock the freezer.  Since it's been a good long while since I last cooked a roast I mean to buy a nice one.  We'll have it for dinner and I'll slice leftovers for sandwich meat.  I'll use up the last of the mushroom purchase by sauteing and adding to the cooked peas.Baking:  Cinnamon Rolls( using half a recipe biscuit dough), Freezer Crescent Rolls(frozen unbaked but will use some with our Roast dinner), Brownies (double batch, one for the freezer), Oatmeal  Cookies (will make enough to add some rolls to the freezer as well)."},

Poor silly dog. I laughed at her but oh it's too like us as well to know our path and then suddenly find ourselves with distractions that halt us, isn't it? It is almost spring and outdoors looks like spring.  Each morning when I get up, I am amazed how a few hours of warm air has transformed the world even more than it had the day before.  If the yard looked beautiful on Saturday it was amazing Sunday morning.  Here's Saturday's photo of the trees across the field:Sunday those almost but not quite blooming trees on the fence line were fully bloomed and the whole world looked like a group of girls dressed for a wedding, with birds singing the wedding march at the tops of their lungs.  It's gorgeous and the air is laden with pollen and a subtle sweet scent too that is intoxicating.  Deep breaths and sneezes, and deep breaths and sneezes."},

Everything baked in the oven together.  Most welcome warmth on this chilly day.  Chuck roast is so yummy when slow cooked but it can be a very heavy seeming meat for warm days.  I was glad to use this up now while the days are still cooler.At the end of the meal, I had a small portion of roast left and about half the potato dish.  I mixed the two together to make a sort of hash dish that will heat in the oven (or microwave)."},

I'll move them to a new post that will be published in 7 days, so your comments will disappear.  No fear!  I am simply setting up  the recipes in a regular post.  So that gives you all until March 14 to get your recipe in to me.  I'll try to get the post up March 15 and we'll see what we all have tried. Here's the caveat, too.  If you've tried a recipe that simply didn't turn out at all let us know about that too so we can avoid making a mistake, just post the link and your comments.  Please don't post recipes you made knowing that your family hated half the ingredients or had a flavor combination you knew from the start was distasteful to you.  I'm not talking about something that you made five substitutions and failed to follow directions but those recipes that you made exactly as the recipe indicated and it was an epic fail.   Perhaps someone will have a suggestion for a technique we don't understand or can explain what changes need to be made."},

The peach trees are only just beginning to show a bloom here and there. It is not spring... This is late winter.  Not a sign yet of the pines blooming.  The distant trees have a softened appearance, not as stark as they were a couple of weeks ago.  Buds are forming, but not yet ready to yield the soft greens.  The muscari which is the usually quick to bloom has only just come up and budded.But what is this season really, this twixt and between that isn't winter nor is it spring?  And what do I do during it?  Too early to plant but golly things look dull about me.  I've been playing about indoors but I'm longing for out.  Too cold to paint (or too wet when it's warmer).   And it's even worse in the kitchen.  Pot roast when I am ready for  Pasta salad.I've been between seasons within myself as well.  Where do I go from here?  What is the next season of my life to be?   Yet the signs of a coming change are before me.  There's the 'new' look in my home.  Calm and peaceful within and brighter and bolder without.  That certainly seems to be an accurate reflection of myself.  But what season is it?

One of my current troubles is that I get ideas.  They start small and sort of bloom into bigger ones.  I start out in one direction and end up taking an unexpected turn in another.  As I plundered my things Friday looking for stuff to use, I came to a conclusion I've been uneasily acknowledging subconsciously: I have a number of things but not quite enough of any one thing to carry out a full theme.  So I end up with a lot of stuff overall and hardly anything I can use.  It's the whole overstuffed closet syndrome all over only it's shed and drawers and stashes here and there.  All of the things I have were gotten cheaply and are nice-ish but I change directions before I've finished up collecting to fulfill one idea and that is to my detriment."},

I have stood on the porch and listened for her beagle voice.  Not a peep.  I've contacted my niece and my brother.  Their pronouncement that they hadn't seen or 'heard her' testifies to her unique beagle-y sort of bark.  And feels a bit ominous as well. There are hundreds of acres here between roadways upon which she might have wandered while chasing down rabbit trails and deer trails.  I hope her instincts will lead her back here.  I've scanned the roadsides hard and looked deep into yards trying to see her short little self within five miles of home.   Once upon a time the animal shelter called this little dog \"Joy\".  That's what she's brought to us and I want her home!  Prayers will be appreciated for the dog and I mean that just as deeply and sincerely as I ever mean it when I ask for prayer."},

I like to walk, the wind at my back, pushing me along.  I admire the colors of the land which look sun bleached and sere.  Beige and grey and blonds against a brilliant blue or steely grey sky.  It's beautiful in a take your breath sort of way.  Even the shadows that fall across the grass have a grey depth that makes me want to weep for the beauty of them.Funny thing, winter.  So many describe it as death, but really it's beauty, stripped bare and scaled down to the basics, beautiful.

At present I've set aside a small portion of a small check we get each month savings $87.  This brings my current total set aside for beef purchase at $139."},

As the writer explores the history of those early days of courtship, marriage and Holocaust she unravels a world of memories that both of her grandparents prefer to forget.In a way, it's also a coming of age story for the author as she sorts out the intricacies of a relationship she neither understands nor can ignore.  This true story is mystery, romance and tension all rolled up into one.I highly recommend this book.  I was not compensated for this review but did receive a copy of this book from bloggingforbooks.com."},

My growing conditions are hardly difficult...well there are worries here and there but you know what I mean.  I have a decent home and have been blessed to make it as beautiful and lovely as I might with my limitations.  I have a loving husband and altogether a happy abiding place.  And I'll grant you I'm about 90 times happier where I am today but two years ago?  In this exact same place?  Grumble, grouse, weep and gnash teeth, complain complain complain...What changed?  I decided to bloom where I'm planted.  I was always waiting for the next move, a move that hasn't come in 20 years and from all appearances may never come.   I'm not sure why I was so certain that this was not a forever place. Oh maybe it's because I had such high hopes and dreams when I moved here.  It wasn't just about giving my children the land to play on as I'd had as a child.  It wasn't just about being nearer Granny.  I'd thought, I'd hoped, I'd reconnect with my brothers.  I'd hoped to resolve the stony (because rocky hardly begins to describe it) relationship with my mother.  The children grew quickly, oh too quickly!, and moved away and Chuck took his life, Mama and I continued to struggle, and my younger brother made it more than plain that he had no need of me in his life, not even as a distant acquaintance.  Grandchildren were born and lived far away.  No third generation to run and play and imagine here as I'd dreamed.  And Granny died.  So many dreams gone kaplooey. We went to the mountains on vacation about two years ago.  While we were weaving our way around a stony old mountain face, I spied a wildflower growing out of the face of the rock.  Just that one flower, right smack in the middle of heaven knows how many tons of granite.  How that seed lodged there and found enough nutrient to bloom is only God's knowledge because it is beyond mine.  That was the vacation I spent weeping and moaning and being angry about how disappointed I was to find myself in this place in my life.  That flower brought me up short and it made me determined to find my own way to get my roots down into where I am and bloom for all I was worth despite the disappointments and losses and hurts.  It made me determined to make my house a home and to stop treating it like a temporary lodging place, putting off doing those things that would make my soul sing simply because I might move off and leave them one day.  Like planting daffodils..."},

Pineapple rings placed in a pan and meatloaf packed in on top?  I think this one would be really good with a ham loaf!  Another dessert suggestion is to put ice cream between angel food cake slices (or a cut cupcake) and then top with crushed pineapple.  A Pineapple Egg Nog is suggested, too, using chilled pineapple juice mixed with a raw egg yolk then mixing in whipped meringue from the egg white. And last but not least, another entree idea, this time of broiling pineapple rings alongside pork sausage patties and piling the sausages in the middle of a ring of the broiled slices to serve. I suppose this was a great month for Pineapple back in 1937 and I don't know if that is because it was seasonal or if it was the lack of fresh fruit available and the need of Vitamin C in winter diets.  Still, it all sounds pretty good...except maybe the egg nog.  I'll have to think on that one."},

My bargain meal netted me two extra portions of meatballs and sauce and though I'd cooked just half a box of the whole wheat pasta, I still had two extra servings of that as well.  Those leftovers were packed up in individual serving portions and put in the freezer.  Nice to know I've a ready meal to eat on hand, which brings my total up to something like six meals now.  Always handy and convenient to have something frozen and ready prepared.I had about 2/3 cup of the sauce sans meatballs leftover as well.  I will puree this sauce and use atop pizza dough, taking a note from Samuel's book.  I froze it in the meantime though.  It thaws easily enough in the microwave, even in my saved pickled jar, means I won't find it back of fridge shelf at the end of the month, forgotten and spoiled."},

Wanna know the two highlights of the day on Friday?  You'd think I might mention the food or the coffee again but nope that isn't it at all.  One was watching John walk across the restaurant.  I glanced up and saw him coming towards me and I couldn't help but think what a nice looking man he is and how dear he is overall...and I remembered with a jolt that 20 odd years ago he'd walked up to me in a restaurant and I'd had much the same reaction...Kinda nice after all this time to realize that I still like him, still love him, still feel that spark when he comes into view. The other thing is perhaps not to be understood by the 'modern' woman, but he helped me into my trench coat before we walked out of the restaurant.  Gracious, just take me back to the era when men did such things as common courtesy!   Still, I don't often wear a coat, our weather being so mild here even in what we call winter, and so it took me by surprise when he reached out to take the coat and he pulled it up on my shoulders.  And I liked it.  Oh, I liked it a lot!"},

So I looked at the stuff I used to wear, another good scent that I like very well and which is real perfume.  I noted that the cost of it is up a little but nowhere around  the big jump in price on the new scent.  In fact, it costs less than HALF.  So I ordered my former scent.  I will have good perfume once more and I saved money which will be spent in other more needed areas.While in the laundry area, I unpinned the bread sacks I'd hung up to dry there.  I clipped them to a hanger and let them drip over the laundry basket.  I am saving bread sacks to pack casseroles and meats for the freezer rather than use zippered bags for those things. I made a broccoli and cauliflower salad.  It's not one of my favorite but it was different and saved lettuce for another salad at another meal.  I mixed the two vegetables with a bit of shredded cheddar, a little mayo and sour cream and a sprinkling of dry Ranch dressing mix.I mixed up sugar free pudding.  I used up about 1/2 cup whipped topping, mixing it into the pudding.  This makes it 'mousse', lightening and enriching the pudding and even though my whipped topping was the fat free sort it still had that effect on the pudding.  The whipped topping had been in the fridge for some time and I didn't want it to sit there and get too old to use.I saved the whipped topping bowl.  I find them handy for storage of leftover salad in the fridge.I ran out of dog food, so I supplemented their bowls with cat food today.  We're going out tomorrow and will stop by the grocery then.  Just in time, too.  I need fruit badly and I've just enough milk to have coffee in the morning.I made oven fries tonight to go with our supper.  I love these low fat fries as much as deep fried ones and they are quickly made from fresh potatoes which are cheaper per pound than most frozen french fries.  A bag of frozen french fries, weighing one pound costs about $3 at the grocery.  My 5 pound bag of potatoes cost $2.29 at Aldi.  If I used the whole bag to make oven fries, I'd have saved $12.71, just to give you an idea of why I choose to cut up my own potatoes at home. Yes, it takes a moderate amount of time, compared to opening a bag and dumping on a baking sheet to go in the oven, but really it's barely 5 minutes work to scrub and cut potatoes and from there the steps are just the same, even the cooking time is about the same, so the monetary savings for that five minutes of effort is well worth it."},
{"title": "Book Review:  A Refuge At Highland Hall by Carrie Turansky", "date": null, "text": "I've enjoyed this book.  It has been a great read.  It has all the components I love: romance, English countryside, history. This book is the third in the Highland Hall series.  Fortunately, the author is skilled and the book is a great stand alone novel.  I never once felt the need to refer back to the other books in the series in order to understand the current novel.This book centers around Penny, a young woman who has moved to London to help her sister and brother in law care for their orphaned foster children.  When England is threatened by the World War, Penny and her sister return to their childhood home, Highland Hall. Penny keeps up a correspondence with a young pilot she'd met while in London. The story of their romance is interwoven in the day to day problems of a household in war time. I enjoyed this book so much, I hope to read the earlier novels in the series and plan to seek out more of Turansky's books.This book was courtesy of Blogging for Books."},

For myself, due to the pouring rain I couldn't do a bit of work outdoors and so I sorted out the bookshelves and found some of my treasures hiding there.  I organized and culled.  I set up the living room fresh with blue and white china and on Thursday decided I just had to swap curtains with the bedroom.  I'd ordered two new pillows on Wednesday and Thursday I covered some of my existing pillows with leftover fabric from the kitchen and sitting area.  It looks nice.  And it cost me two new pillows which I bought on sale for less than $30.  Ta Done!Well let's get busy with the week ahead of us."},

Kip, I went and looked for the Barefoot pink champagne...No luck in my shopping areas.  I even went into the liquor store to look for it.  I came away with a huge bottle of Moscato and that will have to suffice for this year, lol.I am so pleased that you, too, are attempting to pull your wardrobe together.  I chuckle at how often I've said, \"Oh I've nothing to wear!\"  I didn't realize all the possibilities I did have and now here I am truly wondering how I ever thought a closet full of clothes was 'nothing'.  I saw a blurb in a magazine about a Good Housekeeping editor who wore the same white shirt and black pants to work every day for one?/two? weeks and NO ONE NOTICED because she accessorized differently each day.  Well...I can certainly manage with my handful of things.  I'm working up a winter wardrobe post already and hope to put together a few more outfits before posting.  I won't do but the one post this time and perhaps one for each season of the year in 2016.I was cleaning bookcases this week and found this little paper scrap tucked in behind some of the books.  It's a quote by Arthur Ashe that I tore from a magazine and I like it well enough to make it my theme quote this year.\"Start where you are, use what you have, do what you can.\"                              My 'new look' using just what I have on hand and nothing more...Saturday:  The coffee I bought yesterday was very strong.  I need to use less of it to make a pot than the Aldi brand.We had bagels for breakfast.  I bought these on sale for $1, we'll get two meals off the package.Worked on our 2016 budget sheet and set up the first quarter page.I reheated the steaks John brought home from the EMS dinner.  They were very good and tender. The dogs enjoyed the bones, the cat enjoyed the trimmings.Yesterday afternoon, I mixed up a yeast dough and put in the fridge.  I had only to pat it out on my pan and there was a pizza crust.  There's enough dough left to make another pizza.  I took a lesson from Sam's book when he was making pizza for us.  Easy on the cheese, easy on the toppings.  I let the crust be the real star.I balked when I bought the kalamata olives I knew Samuel liked.  They were about $5 for 5 ounces.  Ouch.  Not so ouch as it turns out.  This is the fourth time I've used them and I still have a few left.  Truth is they have so much flavor that you don't need loads of them, as say I do when I use plain black olives...So yet again, I'm learning that quality vs. quantity and buying the best you can afford is a better option than lots of lesser quality ingredients.I used the last of the yummy pizza sauce Sam made when he was here on my pizza.  I confess I've always used canned spaghetti sauce or canned tomato sauce that I seasoned but he made his sauce from fire roasted tomatoes, garlic and onion, cooked it down and then blended it.  It's something I'll consider in the future.Made up John's lunch for work tomorrow.I have no eggs for John's breakfast, but I do have a breakfast sandwich that I've thawed and will reheat in the morning.  I'll also heat one of those banana muffins I made for him.  I'll eat the other one with a chunk of cheese for my breakfast.Washed a full load of dishes in the dishwasher."},

{"title": "Christmas Decorating 2015", "date": null, "text": "Several years back, John insisted we should put up our Christmas tree on Thanksgiving evening.  Prior to that the tree never went up before December 15 and took a week to put together, string lights and decorate and it came down December 26 and that was the end of that.  Now we put it up Thanksgiving evening and take it down by December 31.  We've really stretched out the enjoyment of the tree in our home and I for one appreciate it a great deal. All this year I've actually planned how I would like for the house to look in the holidays.  I've been happy with my farmhouse look overall and more and more I'm pulling in vintage elements and rustic pieces.  That's exactly the sort of things I've pinned to my Holiday in the Country and Holiday Table boards, too.Thursday, Thanksgiving Day, I went out to the shed to fetch my Christmas bins.  I gave a good look around while I was out there and suddenly I had this vision of what my Christmas decor would be this year.  It has nothing to do with vintage.  It has nothing to do with rustic.  It doesn't have anything to do with the green/white/brown colors I'd thought I might use at first, nor the silver and white with emerald I'd been thinking I'd really like to try.  And if we start with the back door where everyone comes in, you'll see the wreath I made on Thanksgiving Day.  It hasn't got a thing to do with what's going on inside of the house either.  Nope. Come in and let's sit down with a cup of coffee and a homemade cookie...What will you like best?  I've got Magic Cookie Bars which I made with a bit of a twist this time...Stove top cookies and Sugar cookies as well.  I confess the Sugar Cookies are my absolute favorites.  It's the best recipe for Sugar cookies I've had to date.  The Magic Cookie Bars were made using graham crackers but I didn't quite have enough.  So I crumbled Matzoh crackers and added those to the graham crumbs.  I was a bit nervous about that sleight of hand in using what I had.  These cookies are one of Sam's favorites so I told him right off what I'd done.  He said, \"Ooh!  I'll bet that will be good!\" And it was.  The slight bit of saltiness, the decreased sweetness of the crust, makes a nice balance with the rich topping.  I'll have to buy Matzoh crackers again next year to make these cookies.Well the family week/weekend came and went.  I didn't get to see Katie and her family after all and I won't even lie that I wasn't a whole lot disappointed, but I did understand her need to decrease stress in her life...You see she's moving into her first house of her own this week and packing and moving and baby equals a stressful time.  Dear Bess did it during June all on her own with our almost 1 year old grandson, as Katie was busy recovering from surgery and tending to her baby and I was in the hospital and Sam was already working in Florida.  I was, I admit it, rather proud of Katie for being woman enough to see that she had to prioritize.  I'll also own that while I was deeply disappointed my pride nearly busted that all to pieces anyway.  It took me forever (as in until June of this year when I had that little life changing experience!) to learn to say NO and mean it and to omit those people who created the most stress in my life from having too much space in my life.I have always been a people pleaser of the worst sort, the sort that just went off the deep end and fell apart while trying to spin every single plate I was handed.  And I am the sort who is always left standing about wondering just why, when I've tried so hard to please, no one ends up feeling the least bit pleased with me and I am even less than pleased with how things turn out myself.  No, I'd much rather Katie admitted to overwhelm and prioritize her life needs rather than try and please me and end up being miserably aware of all she might be doing were it not for a four hour road trip and a two hour family visit."},

I confess I was much amused by my Florida family's response to the weather.  Seems compared to their daily temperatures it was cold!  Well all righty then!  At least one set of us was happy with the weather and their much amused dad and I kept quiet and let them enjoy the cooler weather they'd so looked forward to finding, even if we felt it worthwhile to turn on AC in the mid-afternoon hours.Happily this week it returns to the normal temperatures for this time of year.  I suspect the propane company will be more than relieved.  Usually they've been by to touch up our tank at least once at this time.  I'm sure they need the business...and we can't forget my number one concern for cold days and nights: PEACHES!Plan meals..."},

When we determined that leftovers for after church tomorrow was the order of the day, I broke up that package of marked down cubed steaks I'd bought yesterday and planned for Sunday's dinner into two packages.  I hadn't much paid attention to price yesterday but I saved $2.18 over the original price. There were four large pieces of cubed steak and a smaller steak which will do fine for a 'second' piece for the man of the house.  I packaged the meat in 2 previously used (well washed) zippered bags.  These I will throw away after use. I try to never package meat in new zippered bags but well used ones. I washed a full load of dishes following dinner. Our favorite Saturday afternoon snack just lately is home made popped corn.  It is so easy, takes barely any more time than microwave popcorn and tastes awesome.  I can make just enough for the two of us or make a big pot full."},

{"title": "Book Review:  The Mexican Slow Cooker by Deborah Scneider", "date": null, "text": "I promised myself I'd buy no more cookbooks, but when I saw this one offered up, I couldn't resist.  It combines two of my favorites: Mexican recipes and slow cooker recipes.  It seemed like an immediate win on both counts. I've had the book now for several days and have read through it.  Here's what I like about the book: there is a basic explanation of the various chilies and how they are best used.  This is information I didn't know.  The author also explains why she prefers the ceramic insert crock pot and the basic cooking techniques she uses to prepare food for the crock pot.  What I find unrealistic is her expectation that we have a kitchen equipped with multiple sized crock pots and sundry piece of equipment.  I tend to run a pretty basic kitchen overall and my appliances include the crock pot and a blender.  I don't even own an electric can opener!There are photos for about 1/3 of the recipes.  The recipes are clearly written and every single ingredient is listed in the ingredients list as it should be.  There are no surprise ingredients buried in the instructions.  I like that!  Not all authors do this and it can lead to a bit of frustration.There are recipes for soups, main dishes, street dishes, sides, and desserts in this book, all of which are made in the slow cooker.  I think I'm most fascinated by the idea of making Tamales in the crock pot!There are insets that explain how to make tortillas, how to use various chilies, what constitutes Moles, etc.  These are all very helpful. What I don't like:  Some of the recipes are labor intensive prior to the slow cooking stage. I would have liked to have had a list of possible Hispanic grocery items I might use to cut down on some of the labor.  After all, I don't work in a restaurant!  Could I used canned roasted chilies in place of fresh, just roasted myself chilies?"},

Turkey Fried Rice (TNT):  It's best to start with leftover cooked rice.  I have rice in the freezer which I will thaw and use and by the way rice is one item that freezes beautifully.  When we used to get Chinese take out for the family, we'd always have more rice than we needed.  I'd just pop the cardboard container into a zippered bag and freeze it.  All that aside, start with leftover rice. I use whatever vegetables I have in the refrigerator.  Here's a great way to use up a crudite platter of vegetables by the way.  Broccoli, carrots, cabbage, onion, snow peas, any color of bell peppers, green peas, celery, broccoli stems (especially nice by the way, if sliced), etc.   Dice about 1 cup of leftover turkey and about 2 cups of vegetables.  You'll want about 2 cups of rice as well by the way.  And 1 egg.  For seasonings: minced garlic, grated fresh ginger root and soy sauce."},
{"title": "My Savings This Week", "date": null, "text": "Another of my 'trash' to foodstuffs.  Here I have used pieces of leftover dried bread, end pieces and odd shaped slices to make breadcrumbs,  crostini and croutons.  Five and a half quarts from a month or so of pieces many people just toss in the trash.  Oh and I have enough slices of slightly dry bread frozen. It will be perfect to French Toast.Saturday:  My last job last night was to wash a full load of dishes.Rinsed dishes and stacked for the day today. John suggested we have fried chicken from the local diner for our dinner.  I made the side dishes at home.  He paid for the chicken from his allowance.  We had our meal and had enough for lunches tomorrow from the leftovers.Sunday:  Saw John off to work this morning.  He had his packed lunch and his breakfast before going off.I washed a full load of clothes and hung the bulk of them to dry here in the house (since they were done well before sunrise).  I dried undies and dishcloths in the dryer as I had less room for hanging those smaller items.Colored my hair this morning.  I used 1/3 of the solutions.  This was a bit trickier than using half of each.  I measured with a ruler and divided by 3s.  It worked very well, my color turned out just fine and my hair was well saturated.  This stretches my current supply of hair color so that it will last me through 2017.Went through the bill box and wrote out checks for tomorrow's Harvest day.  As I worked on my half payments, I realized I could push the electric bill and one other half payment over to the medical bills account, which allowed me to pay another portion of a good sized bill.  I will knock this one out a bit at a time, without borrowing or touching savings.  I had a portion of money left in that fund that will start the payment for December."},

I am also hoping to pick up one or two or three turkeys while the prices are so very low.  I cannot beat these prices at all, haven't seen anything like them in years upon years and it seems to me that turkeys (which keep frozen up to a year) are space worthy and very budget friendly.I plan a Thanksgiving dinner for John and I:We're simple folks and that is all there is to it.  Our menu seldom varies and the reason for that is my husband leans strong on tradition when it comes to his Thanksgiving meal.  He wants what he wants and turkey sandwiches to follow up with.  Normally for the two of us I purchase a breast only but with the excellent prices on whole turkeys and John's love of stuffing, which works best in a whole bird, this was the better option this year.TurkeyStuffingGravyGreen Bean CasseroleBroccoli or Brussels Sprouts in Cheese SauceTwice Baked Sweet Potatoes with Marshmallow ToppingCranberry sauce and Cranberry RelishPumpkin PieI have all but the canned fried onions on hand.  I thought I'd just make my own onion rings.  It takes next to no time and can be done ahead since I will be putting them in the bean casserole to bake anyway.  I plan to 'work ahead' this weekend, since our dinner will be either Wednesday or Friday depending upon John's preference.  The turkey has been thawing in the fridge since Wedneday when I bought it.  I'll bake the sweet potato, make my onion rings and make my Pumpkin Pie today.  I plan to get my stuffing breads crumbled and onions and celery chopped.  I have broth thawing for gravy and stuffing.  We determined we'd stick with our traditional holiday breakfast of  canned cinnamon rolls with a less fatty side and we'll have that on the proper day itself.  We'll at least have that much of a tradition for the day proper.I plan meals for the rest of the week:"},

Talk about them when you are at home and when you are on the road, when you are going to bed and when you are getting up. 8Tie them to your hands and wear them on your forehead as reminders. 9Write them on the doorposts of your house and on your gates."},

This brought about another closet clean out.  Nearly all my things are just too big.  I have no dress trousers at all. Thankfully Katie came down for the wedding and put together a nice outfit for me but it really pointed up my need to actively shop for a few key items.  Fun part was her creative use of accessories to go with my outfit today.  I wouldn't have paired up the bracelets she did but I could see right away how sophisticated it looked. Katie gifted me another lipstick.  I won't need to buy any new fall/winter colors courtesy of her generosity.The roast beef I cooked today netted me lots of leftovers.  I've planned leftovers into one meal this week but shall also be packing some of this into the freezer for future meals.  I cooked the beef only to rare, which will make it possible to reheat and prevent drying out the meat."},
{"title": "BOOK REVIEW:  When Lions Roar, The Churchills and The Kennedys", "date": null, "text": "With my interest in history overall, and having become a little fascinated with Winston Churchill (courtesy the BBC productions such as \"Wartime Kitchen and Garden\" and PBS \"Homefires\") and the fondness the British people held for him, I couldn't resist this title, which includes the Kennedys, another family I've only recently become interested in.  I was not disappointed in this book at all.The book covers decades, starting with the Franklin D Roosevelt years in the White House and going beyond John F. Kennedy's assasination.  The Kennedy family ties to Winston Churchill first began in 1933 when Joseph Kennedy brought his family to England and spent some time at the Churchill home.  There began a long and sometimes tenuous association between two great families in two great countries. The book is a tell all story, but not written in a trashy sensational manner.  It is however, an accurate accounting of the real and public lives of two families with enormous political influence in the world as well as in their own countries and the connected power influenced history in each other's country as well.This is a hefty read at 643 pages but so fascinating that it hardly seems a lengthy book at all!  I highly recommend it if you are interested in historical and personal accounts of the Kennedys or the Churchills."},

I felt downright lousy Sunday.   I greatly enjoyed the wedding but it was outdoors Saturday evening, which was a cold evening.  Brrrr...And the cold came back with a vengeance.  Not a lot I could do while feeling bad...but I had to do something.So I started making lists.  We have agreed to do family gifts for each family group but we do purchase items for one another and Mama.  I've bought nothing thus far.  I don't even have Christmas cards, having failed to purchase cards last year at end of season sales. I started with the Thanksgiving holiday.  I must purchase several of the components for a holiday meal.  I've nothing at present but cranberry sauce and pumpkin.  And there's that holiday breakfast thing.  No canned cinnamon rolls this year but we must have a nice diabetic friendly but special holiday meal.  I.have.no.idea.  Oh dear.  I do, at least, have an idea of what I'd like to do with the table for mine and John's Thanksgiving meal.  I haven't done a trial run of it yet, but will try to get that done tomorrow.Then we'll have visitors before November is over and done. I'd like to have items ready to send off with them, so I must hurry and purchase that and gather the other items ."},
{"title": "This Week In My Home: Format Change", "date": null, "text": "I decided this past week, while I was still recovering, that I'd like to change up the format a little bit. So the title of this post each week will simply be \"This Week In My Home\".  I'll divide the post into meals, jobs, plans (not work but appointments, etc) and play.I did very slightly better in using planned menus this week, but not as well as I ought.  This was partly due to creatively using leftovers and partly due to a sandwich we bought for our lunch that proved so hefty it served us supper as well.  My appetite is off.  I get plenty hungry and then I want something to eat nearly immediately but I could have cared less about making meals overall, so that too threw me off.  However, I am feeling better and mean to get back on the better path of making and following menu plans.I've just been over at A Tray of Bliss to read this post  on menu planning.  I love the format she's used for her form and that it has a separate block solely for prepping for the next day.  Love that bit of time savings she plans into her day.  I was duly impressed, and I'd say I've pretty much seen every form of planner/planning available out there over my years as a homemaker.  This is just genius as far as I'm concerned, right up there with planning twice a week (to insure you use up all the leftovers).So here we go with our new version of \"This Week In My Home\"..."},

I had so much more bread than I'd thought.  Again these are those end pieces, or the last couple of pieces that got a little too dry to be tasty.  I typically make bread crumbs and croutons from them but I can't make that many croutons!  I decided to make a breakfast Strata casserole.  I cut up too many bread cubes and so I ended freezing half the meat/veg/bread cubes/cheese mixture for a future casserole.  I'll just mix up milk and eggs when I get ready to make that casserole.Today's dinner is leftovers from the week past.  I added a freshly prepared salad, and a Pineapple cobbler.  This was  sort of makeover of a 1950's recipe I had sometime ago.  I made this cobbler using juice packed fruit and making a cheddar streusel sort of topping rather than a full pastry crust. Pineapple is good for coughs and colds.  I drank the juice leftover from the cubes.Rinsed and stacked dishes. The only medication we have in house to help alleviate coughs and make them more productive happens to dry me out horribly.  As John took his pill this evening, I noted that they were scored...I took half a pill, which seems to be the right dosage for me.  It brought relief from the unrelenting cough and wheezing.John received a statement from his insurance related to the doctor visit he'd just had.  The doctor he's seeing is not covered but...after reading his statement and realizing how very much his deductible out of pocket amount is for doctors within the network...I told him he may as well see the doctor of choice.  We're going to pay out less for him to see him now and then than we will to try and meet that deductible!"},

I went out this morning to pay bills, deposit a check, get our pay period cash for groceries and allowances and run by CVS.  I still had those Extra Cash Bucks I hadn't cashed out and we were down to the dregs of the shampoo bottle.  I looked long and hard at the sales ad, used coupons, printed off more store coupons at the kiosk and did rather well overall.  My first total was $34, coupons and ECBS lowered that to $19 and I earned $7 more in ECBS.  I felt I'd done rather well.  That netted me two toothpaste, two big bottles of shampoo, two bottles of Magnesium citrate, a big bottle of store brand coated low dosage aspirin, a card, and a gallon of milk.  I had $9.50 in ECBS when I walked in so to come out with $7 seemed fair enough to me.I coughed myself silly while in CVS.  I guess I was on the too warm side, so I slipped off my jacket and loosened my scarf and soon calmed down.  I felt like such a heel though, really, because I appeared to have come away from home while deeply sick and all too willing to spread about my germs.  Truth was when I left home this morning I'd barely coughed in 5 hours!"},

Meal plans went kaplooey last week.  I don't think I made more than one of the meals on my plan. That's the way it goes some weeks, you know.  So I just used what I had on hand as we wanted to use it and didn't worry about whether it was on the plan, didn't plan to use a thing we didn't already have.  Meals were simple overall and most all included as much extra Vitamin C as I could include.  We had enough leftovers to serve us weekend meals.  Since these were not planned meals for last week I'll include those menus here this week."},

This month I'm listing posts/comments in order of posting.  I'm too strained with foggy brain to figure out how to make sure I get them all in the right category this month.I started this month with a Savings post.  These two comments I especially wanted to make note of here.  First from Lana  came a very good hint, sort of hidden like a gem in her posted comment.  She was telling how this past spring, rather than buy cut flowers for dinner parties, she used baskets filled with bulk purchased six packs of annuals.  After the party, she planted the flowers in her yard.  So smart! And Erika  was pleased to discover that I found the canned potatoes froze better in prepared ahead entrees or soups.  They never seem to take on the soggy texture that fresh potatoes do.  I confess I'm not fond overall of canned potatoes but they are handy for Canned Vegetable Soup (that's multiple cans of vegetables dumped in a pan and heated with broth) and if you happen to have enough leftover to freeze, you never have to pick out the potatoes.  I've also used them in pot pies or stews I wanted to freeze.   psst....check out Erika's blog.Settling Into A New Budget Season Sarah and Lana recommended a blog: http://gdonna.com/  She is experimenting with meals and such from 1943.  If you garden you'll enjoy seeing her victory garden, too!Georgene the series was BBC's Wartime Kitchen and Garden.  The link will take you to all 8 episodes.  Kathy this link is for you, too.  As for your question about whether I feel the need of stocking up check out my post, State of the Union Address, the Economy this week.Vicki  I thought the broken pot would be cute on it's side, too.  I even bought the pansies to go in it but the two halves are too shallow for plants on their own and the doggone thing will not stay together unless it's sitting upright, so it's a broken upright pot."},

(Since we seldom do anything why mention it?  We do however, often try to do something special on New Year's Day, so there is that.)I feel, given the year I've had, that I've gotten quite a lot done this year.  I think sheer determination is 90% of the success I've experienced in the past few months.  I was just doggone determined to make this year (or what remained of it) a year of accomplishment. Today I reviewed the original resolutions for 2015 and the home projects I wanted to accomplish.  Wow.  That's all I can say, just wow.  I accomplished many of them and really stretched my dollars doing it.  And then I threw in the back porch decor for good measure. First and foremost, let's get this meal plan knocked out.  I was really disappointed in the Moroccan Chicken recipe last week.  In theory it sounded really good.  It did tweak my imagination about using a spicy seasoning on oven roasted sweet potato fries in future, but otherwise...not so much.  I want to experiment and add in some new flavors but this week I'll return to TNTs, tried and true recipes.  I plan to go through my recipe files and look for new ideas to introduce in the next menu cycles...a little more planning ahead.I'm finding that though I plan a full week of menus most weeks (five days this time since John is working two days), it's best to stop on Thursday afternoon and plan again.  It allows me to use up any leftovers that might otherwise end being waste.    So what is here for Sunday through Thursday is usually about right and Friday/Saturday is prone to change most weeks."},

Our pantry/freezer were a bonus to us at the end of Spring/early Summer this year when I was too ill to shop for groceries.  It would have stood us in as good stead if for some reason John was out of work.  I've said before that in my mind, a full pantry and a filled freezer are like having an additional emergency savings account, only it's assets in nutrient rich foods.  If necessary  we could probably manage a good month and a hard month on what we have in the house.  I say a hard month because we're low on fruits and green vegetables and flours at the moment.

{"title": "This Week In My Home: A Well Seasoned Saver", "date": null, "text": "As I tried to determine what my theme this week would be, I worked on menus.  \"Well Seasoned\" seemed to be a good term to describe the hearty sorts of meals that were filling my menu...and I realized that as a homemaker and a frugalite I am well seasoned, having stood the test of time over these years, honing my skills year in and year out  whatever season of year or life I found myself.I was contemplating this as I worked on the menus and then Samuel called to chat.  I put aside my work and went to the chair in the kitchen sitting area and listened to him talk of the work he'd done in his yard this week, his hopes for the future provision of his family and his dreams.  Thenhe started telling me of a class he'd had to attend for work.  \"We were asked to tell the defining moment of our lives, when we realized who we were for the first time,\" he began.  He told me of the stories others had to share as he waited his turn.  \" I told the class that my defining moment was when I went into the Navy and a group of us went out to eat at Olive Garden.\"  He said his whole group looked at him with complete puzzlement. He went on to explain,\" 'There were seven of us having dinner and I thought Olive Garden was the nicest restaurant I'd ever been in. I recalled that my family had only really eaten out in restaurants twice in all our years growing up and suddenly I understood why.  It was a defining life moment for me because I realized then that we'd been poor.  I never knew it because Mama and Dad were always so good at providing for us,'   But honestly, Mama, I never knew we were poor until that moment in the restaurant.\"I put my phone down and cried, ladies.  I recall those years of feeling sick to my stomach that I had only $40 to spend on groceries for 7 people and part of that had to be allocated to diapers for Danny and Katie (she was in nursery, Danny attended Special Education school) each week.  I recall standing at the meat counter wondering how much meat I could buy and how well I could provide for the childrens' diets with what was left after putting those diapers in the buggy.  Oh how it hurt me! But there were blessings, too.  My brother provided us with deer meat for a season or two.  He liked hunting but didn't like eating the meat.  He'd have the deer processed and bring it to us and fill the freezer.  Mama would show up now and then with a big brown grocery bag of fresh fruit.  I stocked up on items on sale even if it meant buying just one extra item a pay period and Mama and Granny would sometimes bring us staples that were  purchased on sale at their markets. I employed every single frugal method I knew to make things stretch, to insure that we put healthy foods on the table, albeit stretched to the limit with pasta, rice or potatoes. When it comes to meals seasoning is everything, agreed?  We can eat very bland meals or we can spice (and herb) things up until they take on a new personality.  The trick with seasoning is balance and knowing what compliments what.  Certain flavors just go together naturally.  Others are surprises to the palate but work very well.  For instance, did you know that allspice adds a nice little something extra to a pot roast or stew or even cubed steak?  It has a knack for enriching the beefy flavor somehow and making it richer.  That is especially lovely in the autumn.Now many people love the taste of pumpkin or at least, per Pinterest they do.  I'm not a huge pumpkin fan but I must say here and now that the Pumpkin, Bean and Chicken Enchiladas I made last week pretty much wowed me.  They will definitely be on  my future autumn (and possibly winter)  menu lists.  Today I found a recipe for a roast chicken that has nice rich autumn flavorings and combines with onions, sweet potatoes and cauliflower which sounds very good to me.  Let's start planning.What you need to know about this week:  John works two days.  Those two days I don't plan my own meals as typically I have leftovers.  This week our Saturday meals have all been leftovers as well, but I'll throw in a bonus menu for you all to consider.Saturday:  Bagels and cereal for John and Bess, peanut butter toast for me, an assortment of things to tempt the baby.LeftoversLeftoversNow on to planning the rest of the week.Moroccan Spiced Chicken with Roast Autumn Vegetables, Hearty Green Salad, One Hour BreadEven though I don't have a whole chicken in the house, I can use the same spice rub, change up the roasting times and make this dish for us.  I have all other needed ingredients on hand.  I'll be decreasing the recipe a bit anyway, since it's just John and I."},
{"title": "I Wonder As I Wander", "date": null, "text": "~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~Autumn finally arrived here in a day of cool breezes, the bluest of skies and a flutter of leaves sailing through the air and falling to the ground. My friend Susan came to spend the day with me Sunday, our first really cold morning.  I had on long sleeves and had put on socks, my concession to the cold.  She wore a thick hoodie.  At one point we stood at the kitchen window and I said \"Oh look at the leaves!\"  The Faith Tree had just let go of a spate of leaves, all of which sailed past the window.  \"I just love fall!\" Susan exclaimed next to me and sighed happily. It was a nice reminder.  I've said in the last few years I feel a certain sadness when autumn days began to arrive.  Saturday I'd said to John that I felt a little reluctant to feel the cold...But somehow Susan's happiness was contagious.  She went to the living room and unpacked the projects she'd brought to work on.  I stayed at the window for another minute or two and admired the beauty of the day and the graceful flow of leaves on the breeze and embraced the season to come.I've made it a point to stop each day at the window and admire the views.  They are fleeting in length. The turkey foot oak has gone copper and is lovely.  The Sweet Gums remain steadfastly green with a few yellow brown stars here and there.  But the leaves still flutter with each passing breeze.  It's worth a few minutes time to watch the season dwindle down.!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!I've been having a bit of trouble writing of late.  I'd come here to write and look at the blank page and eventually close it and go away.  I decided this past week I needed to employ my journal once more. I have, for the past few months, either journaling daily or writing nothing for weeks on end.  I've noticed that when I use my journal I seem to have no trouble writing or finding inspiration.  It's not that I do anything special on those days except emptying my mind of the clutter of thoughts.  To do lists and thoughts about what happened the day before or the dream I had during the night are all I ever write about in my journal,  but it's beginning to work. @@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@There are times I simply long for places in my past.  Here of late it's the old church where I grew up. I long to go sit in the old handmade pews and look out of the wavy glass in the windows at the field next door (or the graveyard on the opposite side which is usually where I sat).   I loved the hand made benches, the old kerosene stove, the plain white planked walls, the raised pulpit that was two steps above the rest of the floor.  I want to hear the old fashioned hymns and listen to an old fashioned preacher. But most of all I want to see the old sweet faces of the dear old widow women I grew up knowing. Beautiful white haired ladies with ear bobs on the huge lobes of their ears and a pearl choker necklace about their necks. I think about those ladies often.  Miss Callie with her lovely curling hair and that soft sweet face and her cat eye glasses.  I see her daughter Louise now and then in town and it's like seeing a ghost she is so similar to her mother.  Mrs. Waters who lived in a story book cottage behind her daughter's home. Aunt Ruth with her tight little top knot of hair on top of her head, adding height to her small stature. Oh how I miss those ladies!Each of them meant something unique to me and each of them were as familiar to me as any childhood memory.  They are all long gone, as are the handmade pews and the little girl who loved it all.################################################################################"},
{"title": "This Week In My Home:  Practicing Thrift", "date": null, "text": "I recently rejuvenated this broken pot.  It's now a unique vessel for my favorite little flower bed.  We've tried to glue this pot back together before and it didn't hold up.  I suggested we use tape as well as the glue.  As long as the pot is sitting upright it stays together.  I really wanted it lie on it's side but this is the way it works.  I filled it with kale and a tiny seedling coleus that came up in front of the back steps.  Saturday:  One of my favorite rituals on a Saturday morning is to take the pot of coffee, my pretty little cup and saucer from Katie last Christmas, a pretty creamer and put it all on a little tray.  Then I drink cup after cup of hot coffee.  In reality I am drinking no more coffee than I do on any week day but it feels like more because the cup doesn't hold as much as a mug.  With all the frou frou, it feels very indulgent and I like that feeling of plenty and extravagance for absolutely no cost to me at all.Last night I toasted cheese sandwiches in a big skillet on the stove.  I didn't use oil or butter, simply let the heat of the pan toast the bread and melt the cheese.  I left the pan covered on the stove overnight and used it this morning with a bit of olive oil to sear my roast.  Then I decided to just go ahead and use the covered pan to simmer the pot roast I was planning to prepare.  I couldn't think of any good reason to mess up the crock pot, too.  I think I got a lot of mileage from that one pan and I had no fear of contamination since it was only used to toast bread.I made a simple Apple Crisp for dessert. No sweetener or thickening agent in with the apples and a homemade streusel topping using oatmeal, brown sugar, cinnamon, flour and butter as the topping. Golly but it taste good and rich.  I often will use brown sugar in place of white sugar as I make these desserts.  I find I can use far less and it tastes as sweet as if it were made with a full measure of sugar.It's a cooler day than we've been having.  In honesty we are getting very near that \"It's cold let's turn on the heater,\" conversation we have each October.  At which point, John always replies, \"It's not even November yet!\" lol.  It is an issue of economy because in reality the temperature indoors is just a few degrees less than when we run the Air Conditioner.  He's quite right we should hold off and wait.  At present the coolness is nothing that an extra layer or two, and perhaps socks on our feet, won't cure.The coleus I pinched from a pot full of bronze colored plants at the meat market has started to root. I'll be potting them in soil this week.As I made the bed yesterday, I noted that the fitted sheet is getting threadbare on both sets we presently rotate on our bed.  These are prints and I've determined the better economy is to purchase solid color sheets which I might easily pair with same color fitted sheets and pillowcases as they wear out.  And then I thought about all the preppers who are setting up food stores and recalled watching the BBC WWII series about rationing.  What if we were rationed where dry goods are concerned? Could we get sheets and blankets and pillows?  Would we not be wise to have a spare set or two for each bed in our homes?  In my early married years I had 14 sets of sheets given to me and thought they'd last forever.  You know they didn't.  They lasted a good ten or twelve years but they didn't by any means last forever.  I think I shall not only purchase fitted ivory sheets and new ivory pillowcases to go with the ivory flat sheets I have at present but I'll get a spare set or two to keep for future needs. I can keep my eye out at thrift and discount retail stores where quality goods aren't too expensive.  I will also reaccess my need of blankets and such."},
{"title": "This Week In My Home:  Practice, Practice, Practice", "date": null, "text": "Saturday as I prepared our meal I thought out my choices very carefully, not for dietary reasons alone, but for economy and overall appeal.  It was cool and breezy outdoors and cool indoors.   I wanted a hearty warming meal that was inexpensive but delicious.  It meant planning both that meal and the leftover meal that would result from making the planned meal.  The meal itself was moved from last week when we had no need of this menu.I've been thinking hard this week.   I spent more than I meant to spend on groceries and I did not fill any gaps in my pantry at all.  I'm not in the least happy about that.  As well, John and I were talking over various things we want to do and we must plan for spending even small amounts these days.  I've decided that instead of planning to buy more groceries this next pay period, other than fresh dairy and produce, I'll plan to spend what I have (without spending ahead) on pantry supplies and fill in some of those gaps.  I won't by any meals fill them all, but I should make good headway if I spend carefully and thoughtfully.  So it shall be a sort of amended Pantry/Freezer Challenge, in that we'll eat from the freezer and work on filling up the pantry.I'm expanding the \"This Week In My Home\" post and adding in one that deals with the same theme. This week's theme is \"Practice Makes Perfect\" and the inspiration for this post is gravy.  Just plain old gravy.I've shared before that in my Southern family each woman is known for a signature cake, or meal, and that is something they work to perfect and then present flawlessly every single time.  In my family Granny made the most beautiful little biscuits.  Mama's biscuits were cracked rough looking things and my first efforts were the worst of the family.  I soon discovered a recipe in the Better Homes and Gardens cookbook which I use to this day.  From my first batch, these biscuits were good, but I had to make them several times before I could honestly say they were perfect.  I could make them almost blindfolded at one point and Samuel learned to make them by watching me.  Now his biscuits easily rival my own as they tend to be super tender and light.I perfected biscuits and then my dad challenged me to make gravy because the two went together in his opinion.  Here was an area where I had to work hard!  There is no real recipe for gravy and how you make it depends really upon your skill.  Roux didn't work too well for me, although I found it quite helpful when making a white sauce (which to my huge disappointment I discovered to be nothing more than a sort of milk gravy).  But gravy, thin and liquid yet with a certain weightiness to it that made it gravy and not broth, was a lot harder to figure out."},

Well right now I am sure of what day it is, but only because I got sick of being confused and looked at a calendar.  Which means the weatherman was perfectly right in calling yesterday Tuesday and not Wednesday as I thought it ought to be.Aside from my desire to get my head straight on the day yesterday, it was really just different all around.  I could not hold my head up this morning after eating breakfast.  I literally fell asleep three or four times and so I finally took myself off to bed where I slept the deepest and hardest three and half hours I've ever slept lately and I had to force myself to wake and crawl from bed.  Now I did lose a bit of sleep Monday night, was awake well before John arose at 4:15am and never went back to sleep after and then my blasted alarm went off a full 15 minutes early as well, so I was up at 4:45."},

I am hoping to fit one or two more in the drawer and that will be all I need.Made an all in one oven meal today.  The salad, of course, was refrigerated, but chicken, potatoes and Brussell Sprouts were all roasted in shallow aluminum pans on the same jelly roll pan.  All cooked the same amount of time at the same temperture and clean up was super easy.  I literally rolled up the foil pans and tossed them.  I didn't even have to rinse the pan I used to bake the foods on.Made pudding for dessert.  While our dessert for today went into the antique sherbert glasses, I put the remaining half in two of the KFC cups I've saved.  They hold exactly one half cup of pudding, perfect for 'individual serving size'.Cooked a few extra pieces of chicken for supper one night.Rinsed and stacked dishes for easy dishwasher loading later.After Shabat was over, I sat down with my October calendar and pencilled in appointments and dates we need to be mindful of.  I also worked on goals for October.  I then moved on and worked on the 4th quarter budget sheet.  I plan to check my figures a fourth time but I am cautiously optimistic at present."},

As with most everything these days it's all 'Use what you have,' a motto I'm coming to learn never limits me as much as I think it will.  What I had, besides those purple mums was the remnants of a bag of leaves the guys brought me back from New York state in 1993 that I had pressed in a heavy stack of books.  I really wanted to somehow use them and so I decided to put them in the frames I've had my arrowheads displayed in for the past few years.  I  chose the nicest three (and the only ones that would fit, ha), mounted them on scrapbook papers with a buff/ivory tone.  I love them next to the two long prints.  The prints were obviously meant to display an autumn scene in the country because there's a good mix of color in the trees."},

She gave me two or three other pieces, all toppers, and a lovely pullover sweater.  She also included a pair of jeans in the next size down from where I am now. I never expected when I started losing weight to discover some of my shoes would be too big.  But yes, I gave Bess a brand new pair of sandals bought end of season last year that simply will not stay upon my feet.  She is a size larger and they fitted her perfectly.Katie sent me home with enough soup for me to have two meals."},

So what is the secret?  Habit and routines.I will be the first to confess that I like a little routine and a lot of 'Oh what do I feel like doing today?' It's the routine part of what I do that keeps things running smoothly, looking nice and allows me that freedom.  What I do in my home works for us, but I believe these steps can work for every one.When I was ill, John kept up the house on his own.  He didn't know just where to put certain dishes so he (very wisely in my opinion) put them on the baking counter, which is out of the direct line of vision if you're in the living room or the back entry area.  No one was the wiser of that little hot spot on that counter top.  He has seen enough of my routines that he kept up the house very well all on his own just using these 10 steps.

Isn't it lovely out?  We get these mornings and occasional cool down days here and there in August, a little bittersweet reminder that summer is ending and autumn isn't far behind.  At first, it's such a relief, such a blessed relief, from the heat that we slip up and forget what they mean.  We just appreciate them as cooler spells.  But then we'll see a bit of blooming golden rod and it rushes in upon us that these heated summer days are fast dwindling and peach season is very nearly finished (this Friday, alas!) and all the things we didn't do in summer cause regret to hit rather hard."},

I made another decision last week.  I chose to save rather than spend.  Yes, I chose to skip grocery shopping and instead to put that money in savings.  I purchased peaches and tomatoes for produce, went to our local grocery and got eggs, bananas, bread and a 2 litre bottle of soda for John.So for us, it's a pantry/freezer challenge.  This will be interesting as it will give me a sort of trial run in figuring out how to manage my nutritional needs using canned/frozen items with only a little fresh produce, much as it will be come winter."},

I thought I'd do my usual round of replies.  So many of you have kindly written encouragement, helpful hints, or appreciation for past writings (which you generously read in lieu of the lack of postings the past couple of months).  I thank you all for it, I do truly.  It has been like having my own cheering section and I needed that.Iced Tea Chat in which the doctor prescribed humming...Kathy, You hit on something that John and I have said many, many times over:  we are so grateful for that medical insurance.  I hated being pushed into the purchase and feeling like a criminal because I didn't have it.  I didn't see how on earth we cold possibly afford it, but we have.  And I see now that it was part of a bigger plan that we couldn't see at the time.Growing up, I was very aware of my grandparents and great grandmothers' lives.  They all lived on a very low income.  Dismally low.  Had they wanted, any one of them might have gone on public assistance, but had you suggested it to any of them, they'd have been mighty upset.  They owned their homes, they had furnishings however old they might be, and with great care they managed their funds to cover all their needs: namely electricity, fuel for heat and clothes (or fabric to sew said clothes).  They gardened, hunted and fished, or relied on family members who did so, to cover their nutritional needs. They foraged for food, too, picking wild fruits or greens to supplement their foodstuffs.  Their homes were not big, nor fancy. Just modest homes, simply built or renovated by their own hand.  They heated with wood or propane and air conditioning was not even in their vocabulary. My grandmothers, to a person, turned off the circuit breaker controlling their hot water heaters each day.  It was turned on twenty minutes prior to wanting hot water for dishes or a bath or a load of wash.  I recall Grandmama Stewart going out to pull water up from her well, which she brought indoors and heated on the stove when hot water was needed.   And all of my grandparents hung their laundry to dry, too, where sun whitened the whites and imparted a fresh fragrance that no dryer will ever bestow."},
{"title": "In My Home This Week:  Work Ahead and Get Ahead", "date": null, "text": "Last week proved to be busy and hectic.  The best gift I gave myself last week was to prep meals on Monday as much ahead as I possibly could.  It worked beautifully, saving a world of time and stress.  I think I'll plan to do that again this week. I was thrown by the fact that I had no roast in the freezer after making my menu plan.  No, none at all.  And to be sure I wasn't just missing it in my search, I actually looked at the freezer inventory sheet I'd just used and no, there was no roast.  I checked at the grocery, and seeing prices, swallowed really hard and decided to make do without it.  We bought food out twice this last week and I was out with Mama one day as well so the need to make more meals proved unnecessary.  I did switch one of my menus to the evening meal.I have big plans for the week ahead.  I'm smack dab in the midst of revamping the front porch.  Just now it involves scrubbing the railings clean and then painting them.  I also have new paint for the two chairs there.  I'd dearly love to move the dog house off the porch permanently but I won't be able to do so.  Maddie likes it on the porch so she can come hide there when the thunder rumbles.  The cat's little hideaway is there, too.   When I am all done with what I can do with what I have on hand, I'm going to purchase floor paint and get to work on that porch floor.  Here's hoping that in the next week or two it will be a neat, clean, brand new space.  I do like to see projects get finished up!"},

Gracious!  They must have hatched out in this heat.  I hadn't heard any here at all until this week.What a busy two weeks it's been.  My doctor asked me if I was exercising but I looked at him and said \"Now you know how hot it is...\" and he nodded.  Enough said on that front, right?  But I promised I would get out in the yard and do things in the mornings and I have.  I've cut branches on trees and pulled weeds and scrubbed front porch railings and spray painted things that were looking faded and weary and messed about in the house enough to feel good and tired at day's end.  I had John set up the stationery bike so I could pedal away when I wasn't busy, but there's been so much to do overall and so many places to be that I've felt I had quite a work out daily.I had meant to work on other things this week, but somehow that front porch just pushed itself on up the list and so here I am working on it.  So far I've only bought spray paint for the chairs which I really want to keep red.  It looks as though Grandmama painted those chairs a few times herself.  The old paint we put on the chairs has chipped off and I've found green and khaki and white underneath.  I'd debated painting them green but in the end the hardware store's limited options dictated the color. Cest la vie...At least they shall be painted and looking nice once more.  They will at least do for a season or two  and then I shall repaint them afresh.The small containers are filled with pudding I pre-portioned after mixing it up.  Perfect for quick grab snacks.Saturday: Last night I opened all the junk mail I'd set aside during the week.  I found greeting cards, a Forever stamp, two pocket calendar pages, a great offer for BH&G magazine ($5.99 for 12 issues).  I always sort out junk mail because you never know what you will find. I went into town this morning for a special reason.  There was an advertised Estate Sale in the local paper.  I found a few nice things:  a book for John, a book for me, a mirror for my planned closet re-do (slated for sometime in the future), and a few smalls for the booth. I went by the Peach Shed while I was out and picked up peaches and tomatoes for us for the week ahead."},

Alas...it's not France, August will come and linger and July will end. I shall find as many pleasures in the month ahead that I possibly can.  In the meantime, let's finish off July with a Bang!Time to plan another week of menus.  The week just past was awesome, hard, fun, and naturally tiring but it was just that, a natural tired.  I think I'm getting my feet under me once more.  I even spent the morning contemplating a Monday morning routine for tomorrow.  I'm pretty sure I'm going to do a thorough wipe down of the kitchen this afternoon.  No fears, I'm not pushing myself too hard yet but I am feeling restless and a bit more energetic.  I've taken care to limit myself to a load of laundry, fresh bed linens and emptying the dishwasher today.I did rather well overall with meal plans last week but at least one day I seemed to be 'off' somehow, either with carb or fat counts, not sure which.  I'm giving myself leeway to make mistakes and figure things out.  I have a goal starting this week: figure out just what carb count works best for me on a per meal basis.  The nutritionist told me to never go below 130 grams per day.  The dietitians recommended  60 grams per meal for an 1800 calorie a day meal plan.  There's a balance point in there somewhere that will keep my sugar at a normal level and I mean to find it.I'll share all about this past week in an Iced Tea Chat post later. Well dears, I am not fit for much at the moment...I thought I'd be right back to normal, because I'd felt so restless in the hospital.  I forgot all about those thrice daily naps I was taking and the very limited amount of exercise I was allowed and grossly misjudged how I'd feel in a normal environment.  Keeping up with meals and dishes afterwards has been about all the tasks I can handle.  I even refused to go grocery shopping today because I felt like the stuffing was knocked out of me just going to CVS yesterday.  Mind you all, I am being kind to myself and not forcing myself to do anything.  I'll get back to my natural energetic self eventually and in the meantime I'll let my body be the judge of how much I do. I thought I'd try to make replies to last month's posts.  Not sure I'll be as in depth as usual but I'll hi the highlights at least.In my first savings post of May  it was the Living Well section with my comments on blooming being a seasonal occupation that drew the comments.  It was such a revelation to me when I worked it out in my own mind, and I'm glad that it resonated with you as well.Shell's comment on this post that my blog is like a dairy of sorts... that was my intent when I left Xanga and came to blogger.  I wanted my blog to be like my journal of life here in my home.  I am so flattered by your idea that I ought to write a book.  I love to write, to share my thoughts but right now I haven't an urge to write a book.  Though I'll share I wrote one years ago and after it was all done, I set it aside and let it be.   It was good experience and suited to the time it was written."},

Oh my goodness!  I'd forgotten how prone heat is to bring up the sugary taste of fruit.  I served the peach halves as dessert with a dollop of whipped cream.  It was so yummy!Curtains have been pulled on the sunny sides of the house to prevent the heat from coming in.I took a dishpan of water out last night, meaning to use it to water plants in the back.  Well, I found ants swarming the porch in the spots where Maddie had set down her frozen bones, so I used that dishwater to rinse the pests off the porch.Refilled dog pans with water and watered the front flower pots, while I was at it.  The cat drinks only from those front buckets, so I make sure to keep them filled to the rim or she gets dehydrated and sick.  I waited until after yesterday's brief showers to see if enough runoff from the roof refilled them but alas, no. Living Well:  I've groused and groused about our internet connection which comes and goes, sometimes multiple times in an hour.  Yes, we've complained to our provider and their answer is that it's our router.  Its not the router.  Reading back through my blog I found we complained of the same thing in 2011 and it ended up being a wired problem which was fixed.  Anyway, complaining, complaining...BUT what good has come of this?  I've been reading once more.  I keep my book next to me when I'm working on the computer and if I can't continue with a survey or search due to internet outages, I read.  Result is I've finished two books in less than two weeks.  I've 'found time' to read all over again and some mornings, I'll take an hour's reading over an hour of cruising the internet."},

Big help. To budget and my own schedule. I'll try to keep up with that plan from here on out.Another fail on my part: I didn't take along a picnic meal when we went out of town on a fun day...and then I didn't prepare myself very well when I was out running errands the next day and heat and long hours overtook me.  I was in no danger either of those days but healthy options that were affordable didn't go hand in hand.  I can prepare better for these days too and I mean to do just that from now on.I'm feeling awfully ambitious lately.  As in I'm considering all sorts of outdoor tasks as a real possibility as well as multiple projects indoors.  So I might just be back on track physically at the moment and I'm finding the need to rest is no more than absolutely normal.   Oh it feels good to be ambitious once more and that's also got me feeling a little inspired...Good things will come of this, I feel sure!Lana, I believe it's exit 29.  The station was called Goasis at one time but I think they changed the name.  There is also a Huddle house and I think a Krystal just across the drive from that station.  The gas brand is BP...Hope this is timely for you!"},

I meant to set up outfits last week...I took time to do that this morning.  I didn't use inspiration photos this time.  I just opened the closet and the drawer where I keep my costume pieces of jewelry and sort of paired things up based on what I liked. Living Well:   When all seems wrong in the world, or at least it seems as the old hymn puts it, \"tempest tossed\", I find Shabat to be a sweetly peaceful day for our household.  I feel the weights falling off my shoulders Friday evening as sunset approaches and it seems that nothing can disturb that peace.  We had a lovely day today and yet there was nothing at all to it.  Just two people who enjoy being together, siting quietly reading, listening to music and feeling blessed."},

The little bird on my back porch that is nesting is perhaps a sedge wren...Or at least as near as I can tell from the bird identification book and online photos.  The female sits on the eggs alone. Certainly the rounded nest, with the side entrance, tucked under the bow of the aloe leaf  is as described in the bird book.  And having taken my flashlight and peered in Sunday morning, I saw the fine lining inside of feathers and dog hair and such that is woven in to the interior of the nest.  The bird sometimes hesitates just a moment when any of us comes up on the porch or out of the door and then quickly flies off through the porch banister and into the brush alongside the driveway.  She's quite shy really, but oh what a lovely song is sung.  Like mocking birds they tend to mimic other bird songs.Maddie has a thing about winged creatures.  She thinks God meant her to chase down and destroy bees and wasps and butterflies and yes, birds.  To that end it took her just a little while to notice the bird in the nest.  As I saw John off to work Wednesday of this past week, she nudged the aloe pot several times.  The mother bird was hiding already but Maddie jostled that pot until I was afraid she was going to knock it off the crate where it sits.  I blockaded about it with some chairs we have on the porch.  That seemed to keep her away, but I noted she was trying to slip behind the rocking chair and nudge the pot from there.  She couldn't quite reach it so was frustrated in those efforts.Sunday morning when I was seeing John off to work, I saw that she's now placed her rug in front of the chair nearest the nest.  I am not worried about her getting at the bird but curious as to why she feels she must be right there.  It doesn't seem to keep the mama bird off the nest.For our part, we're trying to limit our coming and going so the bird will sit on the eggs and hatch them."},

Fortunately for me, I learned long ago with the Atkins diet that planning meals out ahead of time is key to success.  I figure it's pretty much the same with my current need to eat well and right.One of the tools I was given at the hospital was an illustration of The Plate Method.  I found one online to share:3-4 ounces of protein, 1/2 cup starch or starchy vegetables, up to 3 cups of non-starchy vegetables, 1 medium fruit (or 1/2 cup starch or 1 slice of bread) and 1 cup milk (or another 1/2 cup of starch or bread).  It is recommended that I have three milk servings daily.  This is something I've not yet worked my way into but I am trying to get in two daily.This has been the most helpful of things in laying out a meal plan as well as serving myself portions.  You might notice it varies from the U.S. Government 'plate' which divides the plate into four sections, with 1 fruit on 1/4 of the plate.  I think the diabetic plan promotes eating more vegetables.  It is truly about finding the balance of carbs plus fat plus protein to balance the body's production of sugar."},

By the way: Sarah's protein news last month was very much in evidence in all the menus I took note of over the past week and I was told it was best to eat meat at least once every day, as it balances the carbs.  Keep that in mind.I'm not planning projects this week, not just yet, but I do have some goals I'll share at the end of this post.Meat Loaf, Mashed Potatoes, Butter beans, Blackberries with Whipped CreamServing portions are the standard ones.  Meat the size of a deck of cards (about 3 ounces), 1/2 cup each of the potatoes and butter beans, 1/2 cup of the berries with fat free whipped cream dolloped on top.  That's the meal I made today and it was very good, very filling.  Measuring my food is interesting.  I think 1/2 a cup doesn't sound like much but it's really a quite generous serving.* an addendum here:  butter beans and mashed potatoes are both carb heavy and will cause a spike in blood sugars.  Choose one or the other and have a salad or steamed broccoli, etc which does not have starches.Dr. Baird suffered from Manic Depression.  Treated in the 1950's, the story of his treatment, as chronicled by himself, is very reminiscent of scenes depicted in movies such as Snake Pit.  Treatment was harsh and sometimes cruel.  Yet, Dr. Baird kept copious notes as he watched his marriage dissolve, saw the end of his medical licensing and practice and found himself shunned by the very doctors who were friends and colleagues, some of whom practiced psychiatry.   His notes became ground breaking advances in the treatment of manic depression as a bio-chemical disorder.The book not only chronicles Dr. Baird's mental sufferings and physical mistreatments, it also chronicles the loss of a father to a family.  In the 1950's, it was believed that the family of those who suffered from mental illness were best to 'forget' the family member entirely.  Dr. Baird's wife was encouraged to divorce him and ultimately to move on into a new life, one which did not include the mentally ill.Through a series of odd coincidences, Ms. Baird is contacted by long lost family members who had held on to the boxes of papers Dr. Baird had written as he researched and experienced manic depression.  Through his writings, a daughter finds her father once again, long after he has passed away.The book is a riveting read and I highly recommend it.  I received this book from bloggingforbooks.com in consideration of my personal review."},

{"title": "Retirement Remedies: Basics Instinct", "date": null, "text": "Today let's talk about basics.  My friend Dawn wrote on her blog awhile back that she'd been cleaning her pantry.  She said that as she tossed foods into the trash that had expired, \"I noticed that I almost never had to toss the basics...only the convenience foods.\"I realized that she was very right and wise in that assessment as I thought back to my own recent pantry clearing.  I seldom had to throw away good basic foods or ingredients.                                  My inspiration today was a reminder of that statement of hers.  I  came across two sources on Pinterest today: my wardrobe boards and a recipe that was just a few ingredients different from a basic recipe in my own kitchen.  What am I on about?  Well, simply put,  if you deal with basics (classics in fashion design terms) you'll double your mileage nearly every single time!Let's start with the kitchen example.  The recipe I read on Pinterest (and saved) was for a Coconut Ginger red beans and rice.  A simple enough change in seasonings and  you have a basic beans and rice meal with enough twist to feel you've got a new dish. The basics are beans and rice.  Think of these other examples: Kidney bean and rice salad, black beans and yellow rice, bean and rice burritos, Santa Fe Beans and Rice casserole.  You're still using the same two basic ingredients with minor changes in the beans and seasonings or presentation,  yet each recipe makes an entirely different meal.                              A pan of Sweet n Saltines, a perfect example for today's postThe recipe in the photo above is another good example.  In the past, I have made the Sweet N Saltines recipe as it is written, and then I've made it  with Matzo crackers left over from Passover and sprinkled sliced almonds atop.  I've used graham crackers and vanilla chips and sprinkled over toasted pecans.  I might also sprinkle over peanut butter chips for a whole new flavor.  It's the same recipe every time, but it tastes different each time I change up the ingredients just slightly.  None of the ingredients cost much more than the others, so the recipe remains economical but versatile.Here's another basic foods example: diced uncooked chicken, celery, carrots, onion.  Simple enough in itself.  But with those basics I can easily make: Almond Chicken, Chicken Pot Pie, Chicken Noodle Soup, Chicken a la King.   Cook the chicken and keep the other ingredients and I can  make Chicken Salad, Chicken Turnovers, Chicken Lo Mein or Chicken Fried Rice."},

A few things I read through were just so much 'peat and repeat stuff that we all know.  It wasn't new information nor was it a reminder of forgotten skills.  But I did find myself reminded of two very important facts: #1 We must be and express gratitude daily for the blessings we receive each day, whether it is a bargain or an inspiration that spurs us on to savings.  #2  Time is a commodity.  If we save time in one area we are free to pursue yet another venue of savings during the day.Most of my work this month focused on Laine's Letters.  I continued perusing Pinterest and other sources for articles on other frugal and financial information.  I came across two or three that were interesting and informative."},

Two things happened at that sale that were nice.  First of all, as I stood in the bedroom that was open and haggled over the price of the quilt, the girl hosting the sale asked where I lived and then who I was.  I always give my married name and then being Southern and part of the settling families of the area, I report my family names that are connected to this county.  Well she straightened up and said \"Oh my!  We're related!\" and she told me the name of the relative whose house we were standing in.  Turns out she is a genealogy hound like myself and so I collected her name and number.  I confess I've never before gone to a sale and discovered a cousin, but I did yesterday!"},

It usually includes 4 or so articles on health related issues. One this time said that anyone old..and they said old is considered 50 and older... should increase their protein intake by 50% !! They suggested many foods and protein they included and a daily sample of how to get this amount. We need this to maintain and build muscle that is lost as we age. It is needed for balance and so many things other than just strength. They said that other health issues are related later too to this loss of protein in our bodies. The article said it was a necessity and that within 4 days doctors can tell a difference in patients. To continue this increase the rest of your life. Also of course if you can to do some strength training the protein increase in food though was emphasized as a Need. I thought that interesting. I suppose their are new articles on line about this.Laurie if you or any other who blogs is interested in the Blogging for Books visit their site here, fill out the information requested, choose your book and after you've received it, read and review on the site as well as your blog.  I really enjoyed my first selection and have claimed my next book.  They have both hard copy and e-book formats.  Some books only come in one or the other, some you have a choice of format.  It is completely free to you.  You can't claim your next book until your review is posted so there's incentive to read.  They have a nice selection in different categories.  Weekly Savings #2   Rhonda and Dorie both mentioned my cookie jar in the header photo.  That cookie jar is as old or older than I am.  Mama said the other day that she bought it at the 5c &  10c store just before I was born.  I saw a similar one in the April issue of Country Living.  It is made by the American Biscuit Company.  Their example, which was colored yellow as a chick ought to be, was valued at $65.  Mine has never been yellow, always white but the pom pom on his tam was red once upon a time."},

{"title": "Book Review:  My Life In Middlemarch by Rebecca Mead", "date": null, "text": "﻿My Life In Middlemarch﻿ by Rebecca Mead is a fascinating book.  Written about her favorite book, the author visits some of the places George Eliot lived, visited, and wrote, goes to museums to read manuscripts and letters and views articles which once belonged to Eliot now housed in family homes, museums and libraries, and reads memoirs and manuscripts from literary professionals,  all in an effort to better understand the book that had long been Ms. Mead's favorite. I could not put this book down.  It is not a dry as bones recitation but a very personal look at how a book literally can be a life companion and how it resonates with that reader for several decades.  Having a favorite book companion of my own,  I understood just how Ms. Mead came to write this book.  It is a compelling look at how ﻿Middlemarch﻿ came to be written and what experiences from Eliot's own life inspired the book.  The back story is about how the book shaped Mead's life from first reading through several decades of re-reading."},
{"title": "Retirement Remedies:  Brainstorming In The Kitchen", "date": null, "text": "I've been thinking again!   Yes, indeed I have and I've been thinking specifically about the food area of my budget this week.  A number of things prompted this.  For the third month in a row I am over budget.  I have allowed myself $300 a month for foods which is more than ample for  two and two pets with plenty of room for stocking up, as well. However, here I am finding myself constantly spending a bit more each month and the freezers are dwindling as is my stock.  There's no good reason for it and I mean that! Storm #1:  Recently I was speaking with my niece, who had taken my advice and taken her grocery budget to Aldi.  She said she'd given it the one month trial I'd suggested and done so well on her budget of $200 a month that she's kept it up for two and half months now.   That's for two adults and two under two years of age....And it made me think that just possibly I really need to look harder at my budgeted amount and make it work a whole lot more for me than it does!  Now this amount does not include the bulk of our meats.  We both shop at the same meat market for good quality antibiotic free meats and purchase in bulk about once every four months.I was also looking online at Pinterest this week and came across a blogger who purchases food for her family of four for about the same amount my niece spends.  It's really made me want to look hard at my grocery money and bring my spending more in alignment with theirs.I have struggled with this for quite a few years and really I've felt that lowering my budget to somewhere between $325-$400 each month was a big deal.  I'm convinced I can go lower and we can eat as well as we do now, if I simply put a bit more effort into it.  As far as my household budget is concerned I really need to be at $300 or less each month."},
{"title": "Spring Fresh:  Updating the Bedrooms", "date": null, "text": "The guest room last fallI was so excited to finally pull the guest room together last autumn.   Though it is not finished, it is still a far sight better than it was last year.  I wanted a fresh look for Spring but I've searched endlessly for bedding with nothing affordable or really lovely being found.  I really wanted to change from the red.Last week I had a call from the flea market and I was told I'd made a fairly good sale, one that will more than cover rent this next month.   That made me feel I could be free to spend my allowance this month without holding it for the booth.  I'd tried all sorts of things here at home but at present, I don't really have a lot of extras, having weeded out all the worn/torn/beyond tired things, I was pretty much left with nothing.  I'd no idea I'd have such a hard time replacing them!  I'd already changed out the blue spread in our room for the madras quilt that John has come to like so this late winter/early spring.  I'd tried every option that might possibly work for curtains in that room and nothing felt right.My little flower bed next to the back steps last fall..Right now it has snapdragons, pansies, begonias and rosemary in it.  Saturday:  Easy sort of day, but then Shabats always are.  We take the word 'rest' quite literally in our home for the Sabbath day.  Breakfasts are generally of the fix it yourself variety and I keep a supply of muffins, sweet rolls, bagels and cereal (not all but some of each) on hand for that very reason. We used the last of the rotisserie chicken for our dinner.I sliced rolls into bread slices to make sandwiches.  The last three rolls netted enough bread for sandwiches for supper, sandwiches to go in John's work lunch and one roll for breakfast slices in the morning to toast.Made John's work lunch.I have a very very limited amount of funds at present and quite a long way to stretch them.  To that end, I spent all afternoon long on Pinterest looking at landscaping ideas that are similar to the one above. I spent an equal amount of time looking at fashion snapshots to try and figure out how to stretch my wardrobe.  This is what frugal folks do: look for ways to get similar results without spending.  The truth is that I had completely forgotten one shirt and looking at these snapshots helped me remember that I had it, which netted me the possibility of two or three more outfits.  Every piece I own is not the exact same as what is in a photo but I do own similar pieces in similar colors and those pieces I don't have I will figure out how to substitute what I do have.  I'd also been about to remove two items from my closet when I came across two snapshots that had used those exact colors with other pieces like my own.  Well, that's two more items I didn't know I had, too!  I am not saying I will not spend any money over the coming months but I'll certainly spend a lot less if I keep in mind what outfits I can make with what I have instead of going off shopping with the attitude that I've nothing to wear. Week 1 was a success.  I never felt once that I needed anything new.  I had only small adjustments to make.  I wore the chambray colored tee and white jeans to a birthday party. I added a silvery camisole under the shirt.  As much as I love the gray/black/white pearl drop earrings they didn't work at all with the look.  I swapped them out for pearl studs. I added a jeans jacket to the Chevron Maxi skirt/white tee just as it was pictured.  It was raining and church is generally pretty cool anyway.  I felt very comfortable.I've been thinking about something and wanted to share it here because I feel it does apply to our wardrobes.  John sort of brought this home to me this past autumn when he found a great sale on a brand of outerwear tee shirts he especially likes.  The best price was for six.  He told me \"I don't really like any of the colors except black and navy.\"  I didn't faint with shock, having been well aware that is what he wears all the time anyway.  I did encourage him to go ahead and order six of each.  I mean, it's a wardrobe staple for him.  Why buy just one? Well it's true for us, too.  I don't wear a lot of any one color  (tell that to my closet, ha!) but workhorse pieces for me are white tanks, white tees, black pants and jeans.  Why am I buying these one at a time?  I've had them in my wardrobe for years and I might as well have several.  Case in point I just recently went out to buy a fresh white tank.  My old one was just too stained to continue to use.  I promise I would have bought more than one had I not been limited to the single one in my size, which was all the store had to offer.  I'm watching for a sale, and I mean to stock up in future.Confession time:  I had a lot harder time making up the look alike outfits this week.  In fact, I ended up deleting some of them and working with new looks.  It was work, let me tell you.  The first outfit was easy enough, since I pinned this one because I essentially have these pieces.  From there, it was a slow and tedious process as I eliminated things and added others and tried to figure out just what it was I needed to accomplish the same feel.So let's see what I can make up for Part II:Photo credit"},

There's a reason for it, of this much I am sure.  That I must go through it, I am also sure. I was taken by surprise to be honest.  I had no idea that these issues would resurface.   No angst or bitterness of my own brought them up but that of someone else.  Nevertheless, right in the middle of the Season of Little Frustrations I ran smack into the brick wall of deep seated pain.  So here we are.There was another healing that took place this weekend when we realized that an old hurt was finished and we'd come out the other side of this long healing with a good report.  That was a blessing, to realize we weren't bitter or hurt or unforgiving.  We could see the value of the old thing, were glad for the journey it took us upon.  I think we will likely move ahead now, and venture out on the next leg of the journey, confident that we are stronger than we were.   And I hope that is what comes of the healing time I must go through on my own.  That at the end, there is nothing but great gladness that I am healed and I can move ahead with out the weight of the old things. The back porch we added last spring.  I asked John if he had any regrets about spending the money.  \"Only that we didn't do it sooner.\"  Saturday:  Gave myself a fresh pedicure this morning.  I subscribed to the Julep Maven offer on Swagbucks...not just for the swag.  Katie had given me a Julep nail polish a couple of years ago and it seemed to last longer than other polishes I had.  So, in need of fresh polish this year, I thought I'd subscribe for a short period of time and restock polishes.  My first box arrived two months ago and I used the polish for the first time two weeks ago.  I redid my pedicure this morning only because I was tired of the polish!  The previous pedicure still looked great.  I figure I averaged about $6 per bottle, which is about what you'd pay for a decent brand on sale.   These polishes are vegan and allow the nails to breathe as well.I like popcorn.  I bought bulk corn and I do the stove top method.  It's very inexpensive, so tasty and I've tried some variations: Parmesan and Black Pepper, Peanut butter and chocolate drizzle...Trolling through my reading list I found one of the bloggers had written a post about it this past week.  It's a good read!alifebeyondmoneyWe went to a birthday party tonight.  I'd forgotten they were serving a meal instead of just finger foods.  We had more than enough to eat with ice cream and cake, too.Sunday:  Put a whole chicken in the crock pot before we left home this morning for church.I had a meal plan...God had a plan all his own.  Though I'd told John twice I had easy sides to put together for our meal he went to the grocery to buy macaroni salad anyway.  The odd thing is that he made three stops on the way home: once for a paper and drinks, once for doughnuts (which was a bust) and then for the macaroni salad.  At the third stop he ran into someone he hadn't seen in a few years.  I think it was a God thing.I decided to get some minor housework things done after dinner.  Nothing big time but enough to sort of decrease the amount of work needed tomorrow.  I hung the new curtains in our room.  I stripped the guest bed for guests coming in next week.  As I stood there wishing I had a fresh look for that room I suddenly 'saw' it...with the blue spread we'd used over winter.  I hurried to pull that spread out of storage.  It looks so nice with the creamy curtains, the same quilt and a pillow tucked into the old sewing machine cover.  Washed a full load of dishes...It wasn't quite full but I put the grates from the gas stove in and that filled it up properly.  I try to do this about every two-three weeks, washing the grates in the dishwasher.  It really knocks off the crusty bits and oil that doesn't all come off despite wiping down after using them.Wore my fourth and final outfit today to church.  I wore the white pants and chambray tee to the birthday dinner last night.  Today I wore the Chevron maxi skirt and since it is usually pretty cool inside church (and raining as well today which makes AC that much colder) I wore my denim jacket with the outfit.  I felt so comfortable and well pulled together.  Now it's time to set up a few more.  It certainly did make me realize this past week that I had no need of anything new just now."},

(*Two days later: It rained hard enough and powerfully enough to flush the clogged ditch at the field side of the end of my driveway!) It has rained enough to keep the yard wet, too humid to open windows, and just wet enough to really make you feel discouraged at going anywhere that wasn't absolutely necessary.   Every now and then the skies have lightened and we've breathed a sigh of relief, looked at one another and said \"Oh good!  It's starting to clear off!\"  No, it wasn't.  It was tomfoolery.  It was just a deep breath before the next wave of rain came in.  And it came in.This 6 inches of rain pretty much put an end to my plans to do yardwork and go out to the shed to work.  All the dreary weather also put an end to ambition to do anything at all indoors other than the daily dozen.  We ate well this past week.  I pretty much stuck to my menu with only two deviations.  Once was a failure on my part to THINK.  John came in late and I waited breakfast on him.  I simply forgot he came in two hours late.  And so dinner time rolled around and there was no dinner, nothing prepared, and I was hot, bothered, tired as could be because I'd been working hard.  I threw together a meal and I mean that literally.  The second time was John's kindness.  He insists on grocery day in getting take out.  I don't plan for takeout but he wants to make things easy on me.  It's a lovely loving gesture and I am happy to accept his kindness."},

I couldn't help but think of the woman we'd run into three years ago at the grocery where a similar coffee shop is located on premises.  She stated she'd received a gift card for her birthday of equal value to the one I'm currently using.  \"I used it up in three days!\" she said proudly.  We typically get a coffee about once a month, but not every month though I do enjoy the coffee very much.  A year and four months after receiving our card we're just under half the value on it...and that's for TWO!  I shake my head still over the silly woman who felt it necessary to use that card up in a three days period.We decided at dinner time that we just weren't hungry and didn't want to stop.  Not a savings, because we splurged big time later when we arrived in the town with the meat shop where we shop quarterly or so.  We went in and bought two rib eyes for our meal when we got home.  Pricey...but worth every quarter of the splurge we made!  We ended up eating only one steak.  The other will be halved and used to make two more meals this week.  No waste and no need to too heavily indulge twice in a week's time."},

I did very well last week sticking to my menu plan.  I only deviated slightly and so the week balanced the previous week rather well and hopefully I am now back in frugal mode.  It feels rather nice. I figure warmer weather for us is just around the corner.  I base that on temperatures last week which warranted running air conditioning two afternoons.  That will mean switching over to spring/summer menus and away from the cooler weather ones I've been enjoying.  I thought I'd try to squeeze in as many of the favorites as I can while the weather warrants it.  Like Chili simmering on the stove as I type...Chili, Rice, Cheese Toast, Applesauce, GrahamsI found one of John's favorite seasonings in the local store.  It's a packet of chili seasoning his mom used in his childhood years and that made me think of chili obviously.  So here we are.  I always double the beans and tomatoes and add a bit of onion.  The packet is a bit hot for my taste so I used my old standby rice to tone it down a bit.  I used Challah bread from Shabat last night for cheese toast.

Oh the list is long and it's short pay period coming this week, so I'll have to trim it down.  I'd thought to ask John for extra money which we'd have to take from our savings but in the end I decided no.  I purchased the mandatory 'affordable' healthcare that I couldn't afford and need to figure out where that monthly amount is coming from.  I don't need to 'borrow' to buy extra groceries.  I will likely end up cutting down on groceries yet again in order to help thing along.  And here I'd thought I was doing so good to finally crunch it down to $350 a month, (which includes our good meat purchases).  No need like 'must' is there, to make you work a bit harder and pinch a bit tighter?"},

For an $8 bouquet those flowers have lasted nicely.  It helps a lot that they are not in direct sunlight and the house is fairly cool, key to keeping cut flowers fresh and long lasting.A great reminder from Sarah came in the comments of last week's frugal post and that is that I can buy sheet separates rather than sets.  Since it appears to be the fitted sheets that are the worse for wear I think I will buy two fitted sheets per flat and rotate those.Sunday:  John off to work today.  I packed his lunch, and made him breakfast.I don't always need to wash laundry.  Sometimes just hanging them out is enough to refresh them. Like bath towels.  They benefit from being hung outdoors to dry outdoors and seem to stay fresher longer so we can wash them a little less often.Saved yesterday's pan drippings to pour over dog and cat food today.  It's an added treat for them.As the sun came up today, I opened curtains and blinds and turned off the electric lights.  The house is bright enough to read easily without lights.It mightn't sound like a frugal thing but I find it is true: the tidier my home the more satisfied I am with it overall.  It took me just a half hour of setting things right this morning and my satisfaction with my home grew and grew as I looked around afterward."},

We have, as most folks do, certain things that come up routinely.  For us those would be electric, Internet, cell phone bills, insurances.  Each pay period we set aside HALF of the total amount due.  Then we set money aside in what I refer to as \"sub-accounts\".  These categories include car maintenance, home maintenance, tags and taxes, etc.   We take the average annual costs and divided them by 26 (we are paid every other week, 52 weeks in a year divided by 2 is 26)."},

You should cook from scratch but forget coupons or meal plans.  That's too much work for too little return.  You should buy top quality as you can afford to pay cash but used is not necessarily the way to go, if it requires repairs or sprucing up.  You should skip the work of a vegetable garden but find a good CSA that will deliver organic vegetables and fruits to your door on a weekly basis..."},

Granny and Mama both had rose patterned plates, but Grandmama Crowley had wheat patterned plates.  I see these now and then as I'm in the thrift stores and I tell you truly that I really love the wheat pattern myself. I suppose I love it so because Grandmama actually used her china, but also because she had both china and a milk glass/fire king type plates with that wheat pattern, so I know she must have been especially fond of that.  I'll lay odds that all of Grandmama's plates were from the five and dime or grocery store incentive purchases.  She was not one to spend a load of money on things except coats and shoes.Well, china is china is china, a passion I cannot quite afford either in cost nor in storage needs, lol, so let's move on shall we?"},

I took back that baton this autumn.  I was rested and had prayed for direction, and I was sure it was time.  I had a better understanding of myself and where I needed to be careful. I approached it cautiously.  Nothing had changed.  The whole issue had in fact, only grown more volatile.  More and more I could see that the skirmishes had developed into a major battle that is hard and fierce.Sunday morning I woke with a weight on my heart.  I felt I'd failed in every effort I'd made in this situation.  I cannot tell you how deeply I felt my failures.  I watched the sunrise and I prayed and prayed asking God to show me what I needed to see in this situation, asking Him how much longer it would go on and how much longer I must wait to see any results. I try to keep our cookie jar filled with mostly homemade cookies.  These were Mexican Hot Chocolate which I really enjoyed.  Right now we've got Peanut Butter Chocolate Chip.  Yum!Saturday:  Meals were so easy today, which I loved.  Butterscotch oatmeal for breakfast.  I measured out the oats and brown sugar, even put in the pinch of salt and set them aside in a covered dish yesterday.  I also measured out the milk and cracked the egg into it.  That went into a covered jar in the fridge.  This morning I dumped the contents of both into a saucepan and we had breakfast in a few minutes time.  It hit the spot on this cold blustery November day.I put the pizza dough into the pan and let it rise a bit, topped it with leftover Sloppy Joe meat, a variety of vegetables and cheeses and olives.  It sure did taste good this afternoon when we ate.What is it about apples that so appeal to kids?  I had two of the North Georgia apples left in my blue bowl and company children spied them and asked for them.  No problem, except there was three of them and just two apples.  I cut them in half and we all had a piece of apple.  I'd made mental note I needed to use them this week but thankfully the problem solved itself rather nicely."},

The platter, in falling, smashed the little dogs figurine I'd picked up on a whim in the flea market because I found it oddly appealing.When I recounted the incident later in the evening on facebook, a friend said \"I'd have cried.\"  I may have sounded a bit hard when I said I didn't cry over flea market and antique store items, but it's truth.  I always feel I'm just a temporary keeper.  I've chosen to share whatever history is in one of those pieces unlike the true family heirlooms. I don't mind saying I shall sincerely miss the little dogs.  I'm not usually one to buy dogs at all.  I lean more towards birds but the dogs had a look of age about them that seemed to be greater than perhaps than they actually were.  They were obviously oriental.  And there was just something sweet about them, the way the puppy leaned towards the mother dog.  I can easily replace the platter if I choose.  After all there were dozens like it listed on eBay at the time I bought that.  But the dogs will be irreplaceable, not unlike the real ones that came into my life and passed on."},

I've eaten rutabaga for all my life in the autumn and winter months.  In my family they were a much looked forward to seasonal food. 40 odd years ago a rutabaga was a strong tasting, almost bitter root but not so much anymore.  Katie, my most picky of all children, loved when I'd cut a rutabaga into sticks and make oven baked fries from them.  I like them served mashed with butter and pepper.  Look on your grocery shelves and you'll likely find cans of diced rutabaga which might be heated and served as they are."},

I thought about my daughters Lori and Amie and Bess and dear Virginia raising children from infant stage to pre-teen. I think of my small heartache for those hands on parenting days being well behind me now, two widely varying seasons of parenting.I thought about my new grandbabies just starting life and my cousin who has been told the end of his own life is imminently near...Two very different seasons of life, a beginning and an end."},

I didn't have time to prep food for today yesterday...and I planned my week badly so there was not much at hand.  I had some cubed steaks I'd picked up at the local market when marked down and knew they would thaw quickly.  I planned the rest of my meal from the freezer and fridge: John brought back home his bag of salad unopened.  I decided we'd eat that for our raw side and I pulled a small pan of macaroni and cheese from the freezer as our starchy side dish.  I found the banana pound cake I'd made and thawed that too.  It was a pretty good meal to be pulled up from nothing that morning and I was pleased my freezer had provided the prep work I'd failed to make earlier in the week."},

I warmed dinner in the oven.  I meant to make salad, but looking through the fridge I discovered a serving of  romaine in a zippered bag and enough salad in John's leftover purchased bag for another serving.  No making salads necessary, just eat what is on hand and not let it spoil.I served packets of taco sauce from takeout purchases with our burritos today.Supper was the rest of the pizza we purchased Tuesday while out grocery shopping.  I'd put in the freezer but it was quickly thawed and heated this evening.   It was handy to have a quick meal.  I'd spent time out this afternoon at my niece's baby Sprinkle.Played about on Pinterest this evening.

I meant to share this earlier but didn't have time to blog as I wanted.  I'm all about making leftovers into a new to us dish.  I know many people who tell me they want to be more frugal but then follow that statement with \"I do not eat leftovers!\"  And they mean it!  I say stop calling them leftovers and learn to make new recipes with them.  I think my family has never minded leftovers because while they might be eating the same ingredients all over again, it was a new to them dish.  And besides, some of the best recipes start with a bit of cooked meat or vegetable!I like Pierogi.  Pierogi are (and I'm not Polish so forgive me if my definition is over simplified) basically a potato filled ravioli.  I've been wanting to buy Pierogi for weeks but the cost at best sale price, is roughly $3 for about a dozen frozen pierogi.  Middle Georgia is not a hotbed of Polish speciality shops so frozen is as good as it gets."},

The weather has not cooperated in cooling down.  That's fine.  We are, at the moment in a cycle of warm days, nighttime temperatures very near the daytime temps and daily thunderstorms which are hit and miss with rain.  I told John that Friday I came home down the dirt road, stopping to check on Granny's house.  About every 15 feet I hit a patch of dirt road that was either bone dry or freshly rained upon.  It was literally a 'band' of showers that went through...which we got none of mind you.  Anyway, meals are a mix this week, some summer, some autumn."},

I got busy this morning and tackled the iris and had the bed nearly cleared out within a half hour. I took advantage of the damp moist ground and last night's rain to get things cleared out this morning.  The garden wagon is piled high with the things I pulled up.  There's a bucket of iris sitting by that bed, too, which must be replanted somewhere.  I'd meant to replant a few iris right back there, but I don't know.  You see there is a water and electric line that runs under that bed and deep digging is not allowed hence the iris with a ground cover of Bouncing Bett, or Soapwort as it's better known went into that spot.  However, some other invasive things haven't heeded the need to keep that bed free of deep rooted things.  There's a bit of privet and spiderwort, and day lily that decided to move in and moving them out is not proving as easy as the iris removal.  I'm thinking the best idea now is to put down some good weed mat and mulch it and use it as an area for potted things. I have pinned a few ideas on Pinterest that I think would be just the thing.Now let's talk about meals.  It's hot.  It's supposed to stay hot.  Nevertheless my body says it's time for some nice slow simmered dishes.  I suspect I'd better plan lighter meals much as I might want those rich autumn dishes.  Cooler weather will be here shortly, I feel sure."},

John convinced me years ago to forgo the annual cookie bake.  Over the years I've pretty much stuck to a very few recipes for day to day use: chocolate chip, oatmeal, peanut butter.  At Christmas I make sugar cookies, magic cookie bars, stove top cookies and chocolate chip.  I've never been happy with my sugar cookie recipe, though I've used it for years upon years.  This past Spring I found a new to me recipe, which I wrote down."},

I've been wanting to have another chat for the past few days but have stayed quite busy in the kitchen.  Of all the places in the household that can generate savings, I think the kitchen is the most time consuming of all. Mind you it's paid off this go round.  I spent a lot of money on groceries this month, but both freezers are full, the pantry is almost back to burgeoning.  In fact, this next week when we shop for groceries, it's my plan to stock up on flour and sugar, buy bread, dairy and produce and exit the store!  I'm thinking September is the perfect time to begin a pantry challenge."},

Obsessive Compulsive disorders are generally addictive behavior as well.  So you see addiction may be physical or it might be mental/emotional/spiritual.  Yes spiritual.  When you deal with any issue that breaks a commandment or affects your walk as a Christian, it is also a spiritual battle as much as it is a mental one."},

Summer finds me stumped when it comes meals and cookery.  Truth is, I like pot roasts and chilis and stews, hearty main dishes and warm desserts.  In summer...well those things just don't go, they sit too heavily upon the tummy and make me uncomfortable and leave me feeling dissatisfied.  And because my brain is often hot as the rest of me when I sit down to relax and do quiet work, when I plan my meals I find myself locked into a sort of formula that involves a hot meat dish, cold salad, cool dessert and seldom employ all those fresh vegetables and fruits that are available just now. A few years ago a friend came to me with tears in her eyes.  She told me she'd been in prayer over a situation in her life for a long time and hadn't seen any results at all.  \"I'm asking if you'll take over and pray for me about this,\" she said.  I agreed.  It was the beginning days of my becoming a prayer warrior and I was just feeling my way along.  I realized that something momentous was going on with this request but it took several weeks for me to understand it more thoroughly. John had a situation at work that had become difficult and consuming. He told me wearily one morning that he'd been praying over it for months and it just wasn't getting any better.  \"I'm tired,\" he said and I knew he meant his spirit was weary.  \"So stop praying.  Let me pray for this for you.  Pass the baton to me.\"  He looked puzzled. I explained to him what our friend had done, asking me to pray for her situation.  \"She needed to step back and rest and I've been praying over it for her.  I don't have the emotions tied with this that she does.  I can do the same for you.\" This isn't about answered prayer.  Answers did come, but much further down the road.  This is about being spiritually weary, spent and worn down.  It's about needing a fresh recruit to fight the battle you've been fighting, a new runner who will take the baton and run the next portion of the race.  It's about asking for help."},

This past winter the lower tree had budded, which is normal for these trees.  I love to see the trees in bud.  As the winter sun shines down upon them, the twigs lift up their buds to the sky.  One morning, several years ago, I noted how they seemed to be raising each twig in a form of praise to God.   As the winter passed, and the freezing temperatures were late upon us this year, we realized that the lower tree was not progressing in the bud stage and as Spring and early Summer came on the tree has had every appearance of being dead.  We've discussed what we should do: cut it down and replant another in its place?  Remove it and move on?  Pray over it as we did the Faith Tree out front and wait and see?Saturday:  We packed up and drove off to see the most Southern grandchildren this morning.   It was easy to pack for, as it was a flying trip: drive down today/drive back tomorrow.  I packed an insulated bag with water and sodas and snacks. We knew we'd have to stop for a couple of meals over the weekend.  We had breakfast here at home, I packed fruit, crackers, and a little snack for us to have at the hotel later if we were still hungry.  We knew there would be a single cup coffeemaker in our room.We went down to celebrate an early birthday for our soon to be five year old grandson.  I figured the twins were about the age to notice that Dan was getting a gift...I tried to solve this by bringing along something for each of the three.  I gave Dan a small bag to carry toys in on roadtrips.  This was something we'd bought for John and it proved to be the wrong size..and non-returnable.  Z got a hat that John got free with a purchase.  He is a hat fiend.  H got one of those dolly juice bottles that drains as the baby 'drinks'.  I loved those things as a girl and thought H would be impressed.  She was.  I spent a whole $1.50 on that bottle, my sole purchase and all of them were perfectly happy."},
{"title": "Tried and True:  Fried Green Tomatoes", "date": null, "text": "It's been a little while since I've done a Tried and True post.  Fried Green Tomatoes.  Good book, good movie and in the South, it's a summer time food favorite.  I suspect, given the way my family preserved their summer produce, this began as a Fall menu item, to use up the last of the tomato crop when it was time for frost.  Big Mama also made a green tomato relish but I haven't got her recipe for that.  I usually do it the easy way and just buy a jar when I see it in a Farmer's Market shop since I'm the only one who enjoys it.Fried Green Tomatoes.  Every household does them just a little differently.  I should know.  I am fourth generation cooking these and I don't do as Big Mama, Granny nor Mama did.  I do them my way.  I like my way better than any other but I don't turn my nose up at these tomatoes if someone else cooks them.  I just eat 'em anyway!Years ago, a friend from the MidWest came to visit. I was cooking fried green tomatoes.  I had a tiny kitchen and the only available counter space was just behind me to my left, out of visual range. I would pick up tomato slices from my frying pan and drop them on the plate on that counter back of me.   Randy came into the kitchen and asked \"What's that?\"  I told him it was Fried Green Tomatoes.  \"Ewww!\" was his reply.  His wife reminded him he'd promised to try anything once  if I'd cooked it...So Randy agreed that they deserved a try.  He stood behind me the whole time I was cooking, chatting away...Or so I thought.  The man ate every single slice of the four tomatoes I fried that night!  All of them!  I never heard him say, \"Ewww\" again when anyone mentioned fried green tomatoes.How you slice them depends on how they turn out.  Thin as paper and they are just this side of a potato chip crisp and yet a tiny bit  moist.  Thicker and they are tender, warm, not quite wet, bits with a crunchy coating.  I like them about 1/8 inch thick which is neither too thick nor too thin in my opinion."},

{"title": "Shabat Thoughts:  What's Really In the Package?", "date": null, "text": "It started with the work we were having done upon our home.  My brother agreed to do two small extra jobs in addition to the big work on the porch: change out a ceiling fan and put in a new light fixture.  We told him we had the ceiling fan on hand, bought three or four years ago.  We really liked the fan.  42 inches wide for a good breeze, 3 lights to amp up the wattage in the room, classic look, oil rubbed bronze finish.So when he was done we walked into the room  and there was a cheap white, one bulb, globe light shade, 22 inch fan.  What?!  \"That's what was in the box,\" he said.  New, never been opened, right there in the box for three years or so.  We don't even remember where we bought it.  The only thing I am certain of is that we likely bought it at a clearance price, because that's how we normally look for upgrades for our home.  We were determined to look on the bright side.  Even this fan, though not what we thought it might be, is better than the old wobbly fan we took down.  And it is paid for.  That's the silver lining of that bit.It's summertime.  The hardest decisions I have to make each week are which of the fresh produce we should eat and which I won't have room for...Tough times, huh?   I did a pantry inventory last week and mean to do a freezer inventory this week and determine just how much I can put in the freezer of all this good food that's coming in right now.  It's this time of year I probably eat the most 'nostalgia' foods since I grew up eating fresh garden produce and I want to cook them the way Mama and Granny and Big Mama did.  Put a plate of Squash and onions, sliced tomatoes, green beans with potatoes and coleslaw made from a new head of cabbage before me and bring on the hot cornbread.  I cook differently from my family in that I don't toss in a bit of bacon or ham or fatback.  I will toss in a little piece of smoked turkey or a drop of liquid smoke to add that hint of flavor from my childhood without the additional fat.For my own sake, I'm going to put down three meals for each day.  I have failed to plan breakfast and supper too often and am just weary of getting caught without a plan.  Nothing but a tiny bit of work to cure that bit of struggle."},
{"title": "Afternoon Refresher:  Coming and Going", "date": null, "text": "Hello dears...Come in.  The AC is nice and cool and there is iced tea.  I've just been sitting here trying to decide upon our dessert for the week.  Perhaps you can help me:  Lemon Meringue Cake?  And yes, I do mean cake.  It's a luscious yellow cake filled with lemon curd and topped with meringue.  Coca Cola Cake? German Chocolate?  Lemon Blueberry Cream?   I have no clue either, so let's just enjoy our iced tea.  I've boggled my mind long enough with the possibilities and it's getting late to even think of getting the stove going.The days have been very pleasant of late.  The mornings are generally comfortable.  The afternoons all that summer afternoons should be:  Blue skies filled with huge cumulus clouds and the earth green as far as the eye can see, shimmering under the sun.  There have been temperamental showers here and there and that too is as it should be for summer in the South. There's so much fresh produce coming into season all at once and I am just one person who longs to eat a little bit of it all.  What a lovely dilemma to have.  Local produce is coming in hot and fast.  Corn, squash, peas of all sorts, butter beans, peaches...oh wonderful peaches!  I can't eat it all, but I'm wanting to put up the goodness towards eating this winter, with just a bit here and there for us to have NOW.  It was last summer I worked so hard to put up creamed corn and realized at the end of the season that we'd never had a single bite of fresh cooked creamed corn in season.  I've had fresh cooked squash with Vidalia onions and in a casserole.  We've had corn on the cob.  I am frying green tomatoes and cooking field peas this weekend.  Oh and I've had fresh peaches and cantaloupe, blueberries and blackberries.  Summer is so good!Saturday:  Made pizza for supper using some of the french bread cut into lengthwise pieces, leftover tomato sauce from the fridge and odds and ends of cheeses.  I topped with cooked Italian sausage, onion(from fridge) and peppers (freezer).Sunday:  Packed John's lunch, made him breakfast.Washed a full load of clothes.Went to work on the guest room once more.  I sorted through the flea market items and organized them.  I set aside several items to tag for the booth.I'd planned to go to the grocery store today, but put it off.  I decided there was nothing I needed so badly it couldn't wait until grocery day.Saturday:  Up early.  Breakfasts are purposely kept simple on Saturday mornings.  Bagels and cream cheese this morning.  Most Saturdays we have some sort of bread (muffins, biscuits, etc) with a light protein.  Easy, inexpensive.Our dinner today was leftovers from yesterday. Dinner was big, so cheese, crackers and fruit for supper for me. Tried out a few free genealogy sites a friend shared.  As I have time to check out her list a bit further, I'll share those that appear to be good.  The one or two that I've tried thus far appear to lead to paid sites.Sunday:  We headed to church, taking off the trash and picking up mail as we went out.  We also dropped off our Netflix film in the post office in town.We'd planned to stop at the grocery on our way back home.  This particular grocery has a Starbucks kiosk. John and I haven't stopped for a coffee in a couple of months but today we treated ourselves.  We still have a  balance on the card we were gifted at Christmas so this feels like a double treat to get good specialty coffee and get it for free.I'd made out a short list of needed items before we left home.  I knew I needed to especially pick up waxed paper, an item I cannot buy at Aldi.  I might well keep my list short but it does pay to know what you need  when I go to a store that isn't my usual one.John and I both wanted pizza.  We decided to pick up a frozen pizza there at the store.  Our favorite brand was on sale 3/$10.  Even though we usually only eat half a pizza, John encouraged me to pick up 3.  We put them in the freezer here at home (aside from the one we had at dinner).Took time this afternoon to get the bill box in order.  The pre-workWe've had a little rain but not enough to really water our plants.  I've been refreshing our stored water supply.  I watered plants with the stored water and refill the containers with fresh water.Monday:  Couldn't seem to get my day off the ground, though I was trying.  I was in the middle of very late dinner preparations when Mama called.  She'd locked herself out of her car at a store two towns over.  I put dinner prep on hold and went off to find Mama's spare key and take it to her.  It was nearly 2pm when I got home. I dug about in the fridge and pulled out all the leftovers.  I managed to put together a decent dinner that we could microwave and eat in under 5 minutes.  The lasagna I'd been prepping when I left?  I finished it up and put in the freezer. Put the turkey breast carcass on to boil with the tops and tails of onions, carrots and celery. I was preparing broth and meat for the freezer.  It started raining and got almost chilly indoors.  Soup suddenly seemed a good idea. I used a portion of the broth and meat pickings to make  our supper of turkey noodle soup.  Yum.  It hit the spot.Made egg salad for sandwich filling.Washed a full load of dishes.John washed a full load of clothes and hung them to dry.Technically today is Harvest day...but John has to work tomorrow.  We decided it was silly to drive down to pick up his check when he can get it just as well tomorrow.  We'll save the 2 gallons of gasoline that would have cost us.Tuesday:  Paid bills after John deposited his check.  I made a trip to town to buy postage, mail off bills and to do my own banking. I decided to make the trip count for good. I'd marked several items in the local sales papers as I looked them over.  I went back over them this morning and made out a list for three different stores.  All items bought at two of them were for pantry restock.  I purchased only personal care items at the third store.Refilled water bottles for fridge.   I like to drink water but John will not drink it voluntarily unless it's cold from the fridge.  I find it worthwhile to fill bottles with water and keep them handy for him.  It works...he drinks water every day.Do you know how I saved the most money today?  Stopping to THINK.  I put an item in my shopping cart online but decided to wait until afternoon to order.  By afternoon I'd reasoned that after all, I could watch the same series online for free.  I thought about running into the dollar store and bringing home a few shower curtains to use as drapes in the kitchen sitting area, but I realized it was one of those snow ball things.  If I got the curtains I was thinking of getting, I'd want to replace my rugs, etc.  I'll just wait a bit longer.Home again, I turned on a fan to stir the air a bit further, rather than lower the AC thermostat.Hash browns are so easy to make and inexpensive, too. I know I've already shared this but I had some for supper tonight and put some aside for tomorrow.Wednesday:  Made a frittata for breakfast this morning.  I used a green onion, the 1/2 cup of hash browns I I set aside last night and 3 well beaten eggs with a little bit of shredded cheese.  Yummy. Making a fritatta meant I used one less egg since the vegetables added bulk to this meal.Heated the blueberry muffins I pulled from the freezer last night.I vacuumed the fans.  Yes, that's right.  I vacuumed the fans.  The blades of the oscillating fans were dirty and I vacuumed them and dusted well then put them back together.  I think this is one reason our fans have been running for the past five years.  We use them a lot, even in winter, so they do get a work out in our home.John brought home a reimbursement check.  This money will go back into savings now that he's been reimbursed.John washed a full load of clothes and hung some of them to dry.I had a rotten potato in my bin.  I wasn't happy when I discovered this.  I was just in that bag last night and never smelled a thing or noticed any soft potatoes either.  Ugh.  Tossed three and then washed the bin out.  I washed the potatoes and put them on a towel to dry thoroughly before putting them back up.I used a dishpan to catch the hot water I used to rinse my dishes for dishwasher.  I then added soap to the dishpan and washed the rest of my dishes.  Then I took that water outdoors and poured over plants to water them. Used up the last bits of John's bagged salad from his lunch.  I added in some fresh lettuce leaves.  We also emptied three, almost gone but not quite empty, bottles of salad dressing.No grahams to make S'mores...I used vanilla wafers. Made out my grocery list for tomorrow's shopping.Thursday:  Grocery day. Made sure I had list and bags and water in a thermal glass.  We took off trash and picked up mail on our way out of town.We spent a bit over usual this go round and we did last time, too.  I'm going to check over my most recent receipts to see just why. I can total in my head our impulse purchases.  Now it's time to check prices to see if something has gone up more than I'd taken notice of.  I am puzzled about the higher total...I spent a lot of time talking myself out of things not on my list reminding myself that I had staples and could make those items at home.Made pimento and cheese for sandwich filling.Did a pantry inventory before putting items on the shelf, then added those purchased today.  I've not noticed a sizable dint in much of my pantry or freezer stock.  I think that's because we've bought so much fresh produce and worked to eat that.  I'm going to use my pantry list to plan meals for the next week.I am putting a halt on spending until I determine just what it is I NEED to fill gaps in the pantry and freezer. And in my home decor as well.  Officially declaring July a 'nothing extra' month.  Frankly, after repairs and fixes for several items and a month super heavy in birthdays we could use the break.John bought lunch today using his allowance to pay for it.I didn't get everything on my list.   I have quite a list but am thinking I will just skip those items for right now. I can easily make substitute items for those missing items until my next shopping trip for groceries.Friday:  John had a class today.  His county pays him to attend his continuing education classes. This is a bonus amount for us, and much appreciated.While taking some things out to the shed, I noted that the blackberries were ripe.  I picked about a pint this morning. I flash froze them after rinsing and then packed into a zippered bag.  I think more will be ripe Sunday. I was deep in the midst of cleaning when John called to say he'd been released from class earlier than expected.  I didn't really have a hard and fast plan for dinner.  I did have leftovers.  I made a salad, sliced bread and made a fast dessert. I asked John to bring home a couple of items from the store.  Those were paid for from my allowance. I'm practicing for my Nothing Extra Month.  Ack.Potted two plants I'd bought last week. Took bread end pieces from freezer and made a breakfast casserole for tomorrow morning's meal. In the past I've put chopped mushrooms in to stretch the sausage but today I had no mushrooms.  What I found in the fridge was a half apple my husband apparently decided not to eat, so I dice that and added in with onion and sausage. I decided to have a fruit salad to go with the casserole.  I used a few blackberries, some of the fruits and melon in the fridge.  Glad I decided to make this.  I discovered the strawberries were rapidly deteriorating. I immediately prepped them for the freezer.We bought an unsliced loaf of French bread at Aldi.  We used that for our Shabat loaf. I cut off the end pieces after we had our communion and put those in freezer.  I'll make croutons from those in future.  I sliced four pieces off to use for french toast next week and then put the remaining loaf in the freezer.  We'll slice and use when we need more loaf bread but haven't any.Living WellSometimes it's not the money we save that makes the biggest impact in our life; it's the money we spend.  John  and I were discussing our finances this week.  We've had a small season of struggle.  The AC needed some maintenance work, the fridge required a repair, the lawn mower, too.  We hit a birthday heavy month.  We had two baby gifts, and a wedding gift to add to the birthdays.  John's work pants decided they had worked hard enough and shredded.  He had to renew his work license.  Am I talking about these expenses in enjoying life? Nope.  I'm talking about the vacation we took end of last month.  I'm talking about the back porch we spent a good amount of money adding to the house this Spring.  Those are the things we mention most often in our money discussions.  Yes, the balance drooped and we had to prop it up a bit  as our sub accounts dwindled.  But we have no regrets at all about taking that vacation nor spending the money on that back porch.  In fact, just this week when the account drooped the hardest, we both made time to go sit on the back porch and do Bible study, decorate a little more with plants and items we already have on hand and discuss our plans to renovate our front porch sometime later this year.You know what else I'm prone to do when things get a tiny bit snug in the budget?  Put on my diamond earrings and wear them about the house.  They aren't rocks by any means, they are not even pebbles.  John got me those beautiful little diamonds for our first anniversary when we were right in the midst of living po'...John tells folks that we had so little we couldn't afford to call it poor.  It was money he saved from his pocket change that bought those earrings and they made us both so happy. Our kids still talk about the super budget vacation we took the summer our oldest son graduated high school.  We spent a week at the beach in a cut rate hotel right on the beach.  We cooked meals in the kitchenette and shared a single bathroom.  One night John took us all out to dinner.  We paid more for that single meal than we'd spent in a month for groceries at home.  When my children mention that vacation they start by describing  the fantastic meal at a big deal restaurant, the first time we'd had a nicer meal than take out pizza. I am frugal because I have to be to some extent.  I'm frugal because I like and enjoy a challenge.  I'm frugal because I believe we should be a good steward of our resources.  I'm frugal because living debt free is a whole lot more than just not owing someone money.  But I never, ever regret the times we spend on what some might consider frivolous or unnecessary things.  As John is prone to say too often, \"What are we saving for?\"  To live well, that's what."},

That's just the inner distractions I heard...There were outward ones as well.  John called.  I  heard the newscast on TV in the next room and got caught up in the news stories. I  started a load of clothes and the machine finished it's run,  making  me immediately aware that I needed to do another task... In short, I was very aware of everything except what God might be saying to me. Another week past in which few of the planned meals were made.  Some was due to unexpected spoilage of fresh produce.  Some was because I was too hot, too tired, feeling lazy, didn't want to bother...Summer doldrums, if you will.  I think I found a help.  I cooked dinner for Friday's company meal very early, well before 8am and then just reheated slightly at dinner time.  It worked beautifully, didn't heat up the house all afternoon long.  I'll be taking that into consideration for the remainder of these summer days and try to get the meal cooked early morning from here on out.  I'm feeling fully rested once more, after taking last week off from pushing to do projects and concentrating on just the usual day to day homemaking.  Ready to tackle new projects this week, and coming at the week with a fresh meal plan.  I will need to pick up produce items this week.  I have none left except a head of red cabbage  and a bunch of green onions in the fridge.  I have a grocery trip to make but I hope to also make time to get down to buy fresh corn to put in the freezer, as well.  'Tis the season, you know."},

I opened the container with the cream cheese and could tell it was soured.  That was waste.  Fortunately I had a new unopened package.  That's the third hint I've had my fridge isn't working just right.  John has promised to check it over tomorrow, but I think it's time to call a repairman in to fix it.No time for meal prep for the day with traveling yesterday.  I pulled a steak from the freezer and put on an iron skillet on the counter to fast thaw.  I learned this trick a long time ago.  The skillet doesn't just get cold from the steak, it's constantly trying to adjust to the air around it and create a moderate balance between the cold and the warmth.  This means the steak thaws quicker, but remains temperature stable at the same time, so it's perfectly safe.  I'm sure there's a far more scientific explanation for it all.  If you're interested then look it up, but don't tell me all about it.  This is the gist of what I got from looking it up myself!"},

Baked a loaf of banana bread to use two leftover bananas.

I must say she reminds me a lot of my much loved, big gruff part Chow dog Bear.  He had a bark that sounded like a deep foghorn and a knack for saving it until you were upon his pitch black self in the pitch black dark, lol, but let one little rumble of thunder go off some 40 miles away and he was a quivery mess who'd dash into the house and head to the nursery to get under Katie's baby bed.  We always knew when a storm was over by his presence at the back door demanding to go back out again.

I had some meatloaf leftover and made up pizza doughs that evening, topped one with a bit of leftover meatloaf and peppers and onions, topped the other with cheese.  Daniel wanted meatloaf pizza for his supper.  This gramma must have made a very special meatloaf.  Wonder if I can ever replicate that recipe again?  I tend to just freehand meatloaf.Saturday:  A very relaxed day for us.  We don't normally do much on Shabat and we do even less when John's worked Friday and Shabat evening/night.   I had no clue what I'd make for breakfast but decided upon Breakfast sandwiches.  It's quick, easy, and filling.  I depress the middle of a piece of bread, place on a cookie sheet and break an egg in the middle.  I put cheese slices on a second piece of bread.  I bake at about 400 until the egg is fully set (I like them well done) and the cheese melted.  This morning I topped with cooked sausage, too. Made sure the AC was set at daytime temps.  It was.  I'd forgotten to turn it down last night, which is a good thing. I put a turkey breast in the crockpot to cook.  I'd meant it for dinner but even after a week in the fridge the thing was not fully thawed.  Looks like Sunday dinner...Which meant I had to cook dinner.  We always have a splurge meal of specialty cut steaks when we go to the meat market.  Not cheap but it's a once a quarter treat for us.  However the side dishes were inexpensive or salvages.  One big baking potato, halved between us.  The remainder of the bag of salad that John brought in from work.I poured the broth off the turkey into a gallon sized pitcher.  I put that in the fridge so the fat could congeal on top.  I'll skim it off and then pour into a jar for the freezer. I discovered this morning that the onions had started to go bad.  I peeled them all, salvaged what I could of them.  I made onion rings from some of those slices, put the rest in the fridge to use in cooking over the week.  I used the saved pancake batter to make the onion rings."},

This week's menus will start with the meal we had today, Monday.  I will be shopping for groceries on Thursday and not a day too soon.  I am still struggling with this short pay period at the end of each month and the reduced grocery funds.  I am so grateful for my pantry as that has helped a good bit, and it surely a good indicator that  a pantry's important in a household.Turkey Fricassee, Salad, Broccoli rice Casserole, BiscuitsWhen I cooked the turkey breast Saturday, I put a whole apple and whole onion in the cavity of the breast, then poured over about 1 cup of apple juice.  It adds a different taste to the turkey  meat and a rich color to the broth and is a nice change.  I used some of the broth to make the gravy today."},

I'd read an account in a Peg Bracken article in one of the women's magazines of a dinner she had to prepare on the fly.  Her husband had a business meeting with a man whom he'd invited home for dinner.  He called her at noon to give her notice and she went into a dead panic.  Peg Bracken's whole line was that she 'hated housework' which she wrote a book about with tongue in cheek.  Imagine the declared clutz of housework having a dinner guest by the name of James Beard...Well she pulled together a meal at day's end.  On her menu was a baked ham and a Cheese Souffle."},

I don't expect much of him tomorrow either, since he has to work Tuesday.I've taken a long look at the meat in the freezer this weekend.  We can manage all right I think until end of April and then it's time for a trip to the Meat Market.  After church services today we stopped by the grocery to pick up a handful of grocery items.  I still stuck hard to my low spending but I did get a chicken that was carageenan free for $.99/pound.  Not a bad price for a whole chicken these days.  I intend to cut and split into parts.  Mama taught me how to cut up a whole bird years ago when she was teaching me to cook.  A cut up chicken cost more than a whole chicken back then.  Nowadays, too.  Knowing that I intend to go to the meat market towards the end of the April makes me want to trim back my budget a bit these next two pay periods.  I won't save all I need to purchase meat but I can save some of it.Saturday:  We didn't do a thing all morning long, nor much of the afternoon either.  It was bagels with cream cheese for breakfast, and reheated leftovers of chili mac and cornbread with salad for our lunch.  We watched a wonderful movie with John Lithgow and Bob Hoskins, \"The Man from La Mancha\"...well mostly watched it.  John and I both took naps but the parts of the movie we saw were beautiful and wonderful and funny.  I'll look for that one on Dvd.Went to church this evening.  It is so good to hear a sermon.  There's one more Saturday evening service and then we'll be back to mandatory Sunday services, which means just twice a month for us.We stopped at Burger King on the way home.  Plain hamburgers and small shakes make a nice supper, isn't too expensive.We did some chores when we got home this evening.  The purpose was to clear up so we could leave especially early tomorrow morning."},

I'll make our sweet snacks.  My second mission is to start using up all the products we have on hand that contain yeast so that we are yeast free when the Feast of Unleavened Bread comes up next month.  You'd be surprised where you'll find yeast in products.  Yeast extract is a common flavoring ingredient in many foods, like dry onion soup mix, some flavored rice packets, etc.  So I'll be digging around and trying to find it now at my leisure instead of doing that usual 'Hurry, Passover starts tomorrow!' approach I've used in the past.I was working on menus earlier today and asked John, \"Anything special you'd like to have?\"  Now normally he might give me a shrug and say \"Not really.\"  Ha.  The man had a LIST this week.  \"Well I'd like to have chili mac and spaghetti and that tuna pasta salad you make.  And you know Cheeseburgers would be good and grilled cheese and pancakes...\"  At that point I thanked him and told him I'd use a few of his suggestions but would plan the rest of the meals on my own.  Then I wrote out my list and out of curiosity looked back at past March menus and you know, I'm a creature of habit and in a permanent rut apparently because those menus didn't look much different than this one, lol.  Every now and then I slip a new recipe into the mix and then I jog gently along right back into my former rut.Corned Beef, Cabbage, Red Potatoes, Irish Soda BreadMy annual nod to family heritage. Reubens, Potato SoupI purposely planned for sandwiches.  If it's really warm I might make potato salad as a side dish instead of soup.  I haven't looked ahead at the forecast, so have no clue what we're in for this next week. Chili Mac, Green Salad, Cornbread, Pineapple CakeI'll double my pasta and set aside some for the tuna salad John requested.  I'll likely double the chili and put a portion in the freezer.  I'm low on ready to heat and eat dishes. Tuna Salad, Saltines, Fresh FruitThe salad has a load of vegetables in it, so I'm not really concerned about adding any further vegetables.  I will serve fresh fruit as our dessert.  Last week we had a really good fruit cocktail of pineapple, strawberries and bananas.  Boy that was good!  I'll see what fruit is best buys this week. Grilled Chicken, Grilled Vegetables, Baked PotatoesJohn bought me a pan meant to use to grill vegetables last year. I'd like to give it a try this year weather permitting.  Asparagus will be in my pan for sure and anything else that looks fresh and reasonable in price. Corned Beef Hash with Fried Egg, Toasted Soda Bread, Fresh Fruit SaladI know John likes corned beef hash with eggs, so I thought I'd include it in menu this week. Chicken Tacos, Mexican Corn, Green SaladI should have some leftover chicken from our grilled chicken dinner.  I'll season it for tacos as I'm reheating.

Honestly you don't know if you should wear the woolens or put on the summer weight sweaters for the day lately!  It makes meal planning equally as tough.  It's grocery week but the meals planned don't require but two additional ingredients.  I'll be making up another two weeks' worth of menus this week so I can purchase ahead.I had plans for the day, since I'm alone, but not sure they will come to fruition.  I'm not sure I'm 100%.  I feel well enough to work, just iffy about leaving home.  Some days are like that.  I have just loads of things to choose from to do for fun and work if I do determine home is the best place to be and that is one thing I can honestly say.  I'm never bored, never unhappy to be home.  My problem is that once I start spending time at home, I can find more excuses for just being at home and fewer and fewer for why I should leave!"},

Not complaining.  Cold weather has it's place just as hot weather has and February is the proper place for cold weather, at least in my hemisphere.  I always thought it quite odd that other parts of the world would have summer in February and then I gained a pen pal in Scotland who moved to Australia and we complain daily over the great heat in her area and the great cold in mine all through these months and come summer we'll complain just the opposite.  I'll grumble over hot weather while she mentions huddling over a heater trying to stay warm.  At least we amuse one another when one side complains the temperature is too hot and the other replies that it's far too cold.How about a piece of  Italian Cream Wedding Cake to go with the coffee?  It's birthday month in our home.  Not that we celebrate all month long but there are many birthdays crowded into this month for us.  Three birthday presents down..."},

Well hello dears.  I am trying hard to make this post more timely, so that it falls right at the beginning of the month and not later.  Here's hoping I can sustain this momentum the rest of the year!It wasn't a high post month.  Part of that due to back problems that continued to bother me throughout the majority of the month.  And then when I felt better I was hurrying along trying to catch up on all the things I'd missed, like treasure hunting!  I think I'm about caught up now.Let's get started!Breahn thanked me for sharing my menu plans. I seriously considered giving this up at one point but a flurry of protests came assuring me that others found this most helpful.  I like planning meals.  I carry them out more often than not too, but I like planning them.  Some people like to rearrange furniture. I like to think about how arranging foods just so on a menu will create a meal that is nutritious, appealing and satisfying. I am glad that they are appreciated.Steak, Sour Cream Mashed Potatoes, Tossed Salad, RollsDo you ever get in a rut with a menu plan?  I do often.  I so often serve baked potatoes with steak that I forget that I could have anything I wanted as a side.  Steak and potatoes do have a lovely affinity for one another, but why be so rutty.  This week I decided to make sour cream and chive potatoes.  Tortellini and Meatball soup, Garlic Bread, GrapesI've made this soup exactly once.  It's from Country Living magazine and is so tasty.  However, if you plan to make ahead and freeze a portion, I strongly urge you to hold off adding your tortellini even if you opt to use the dried shelf stable type instead of fresh or frozen.  It takes absolutely no time to overcook and becomes gummy and unpleasant.  I learned my lesson the hard way.  However, this soup is sooo good and takes only a little while to make from scratch."},

Pour  it in the old Hershey bottle and they drank it right up.  I stopped making it for the longest time, then realized I really missed having the occasional chocolate milk and in winter I missed having hot cocoa that tasted like hot chocolate and not like grainy weird stuff the way packets sometimes do.  The dry powder in my jar is a simple mix of confectioner's sugar and cocoa and does very well for a substitute, but I mean to make time to make that syrup again shortly."},
{"title": "Shabat Thoughts - He Calls Me Friend", "date": null, "text": "One of the songs John loves to play in worship here at home is \"I Am  A Friend Of God\".  The song, taken in part from Psalms 8:3-4 poignantly wonders how God, Creator of All, can be focused upon something so finite and small as  a single soul when the heavens are so vast:  Who am I that You are mindful of meThat You hear me when I callIs it true that You are thinking of meHow You love meIt's amazingI have just posted last week's Frugal Week post. I had a good bit of waste last week.  I think every day but the last two I tossed at least one item into the trash that had spoiled or was way beyond the expiration date.  Not good!  This week I plan to use what I have before anything more can spoil.  I'm over the consequences of not checking the fridge daily to see what needs to be used up!I didn't make as many meals as planned last week.  I was gone more than I'd thought I might be, used leftovers a couple more times than I thought I would, so there are a couple of repeats from recent weeks in this week's menu.I need to start quickly with today's meal because honestly, I must use up a half pound of hamburger TODAY.Chicken Noodle Soup, Waldorf Salad, Molten Lava CakesI served this meal yesterday.  Sam contacted me late Friday night and said he and Bess were coming down to spend the day.  I had leftover Chicken Stew with Dumplings that I'd made last week.  I smashed the fluffy dumplings to thicken the stew, cooked egg noodles and dumped them in to make a nice chicken soup.  I used 1 apple and 1 small stem of halved red grapes to make the salad, dressed with a bit of sour cream and orange juice concentrate.I can't get my usual photo to load for some reason...Oh well, this will do, because we all know that little savings add up to bigger ones!Jan 18:  The soup I made yesterday afternoon was just a tad too salty.  I think it was the bouillon cubes.  I added a diced potato.  That made it more palatable.I made muffins this morning for breakfast using blueberries from the freezer and the streusel left from my Banana Bread Cobbler recipe last week.   We attended synagogue today.  On our way we went through a small town.  A church was selling donuts for a ministry fundraiser at one of the intersections.  We always support the prom committees, seniors and churches that sell donuts. They cost $5, just about what they cost at the store.  John and I each had one.  We decided this afternoon to send them with him to work tomorrow.  We don't need the extra calories and the guys and girls at the shop will appreciate having a quick snack to grab if they don't have time to eat a meal.We stopped and bought chicken on the way home, since John didn't want to eat soup again today.  I wasn't surprised.  He said it was good last night and I believe he thought it was.  Soup is one of the few items I make that he seldom wants leftovers of and so I'd already planned for that possibility and  provided my allowance to purchase the chicken.   We had cereal for supper.  I'll eat soup tomorrow for my meal and then will portion out soup in individual containers for me to have for supper or lunch on my alone days. What we normally do on our way home: stop and by a soda.  Today we skipped that. This usually comes from John's pocket money so it doesn't really affect the household funds, but it is still a savings, which stretches his allowance to last a little closer to pay day.Portioned leftover chicken into two separate servings.  I'll send one in John's work lunch tomorrow and likely eat the other for my supper.Mama gifted me her gently read magazines before I left her home Wednesday.  I read two of them this afternoon.Mama also gave me her coupon fliers from the past couple of weeks.  That included  the five inserts that came out two weekends ago.Went 12 hours without an over the counter pain reliever.  I've been using them pretty steadily since my back first hurt, but have been gradually stretching out the time between doses.  I'd made it as much as 6-7 hours until today when I went a full 12 without.  Healing in steps.  I'll be glad to cut back and save the added expense this has brought.Packed John's work lunch.  Washed a full load of dishes.Got cold on the ride up to synagogue, got colder in synagogue.  Seemed like once we came home I just couldn't get warm.  I checked the thermostat and the thing was right smack on 68F.  I turned on the tea kettle in the hope the steam would warm the house.  It didn't really help much but I covered up with a fleece throw and that did help.Received the last Amazon card ordered with Swagbucks. Waste:  Opened the jar of roasted red peppers in the fridge to make peppers and cheese (less expensive version of pimento cheese), only my peppers were moldy.  Yuck!  Tossed that in the trash.  Now I knew full well that I needed to divide that bigger jar between smaller ones and freeze them or I'd lose that product.  I guess I just plain let myself get distracted over the past few weeks.  My failure cost me a small amount of money loss.  Phooey.  AND I've noted that I always date the products I'm putting in the freezer, so I know how long they've been there, but I seldom do such for things like roasted red peppers in the fridge.  I'm adding that to my 'To Be Done' list in order to help avoid future losses.  Lesson learned.Jan. 19:  There wasn't really enough coffee for a second cup this morning, since I was using a larger mug. I made a fresh pot, which I forgot to put on the bold setting.  So so coffee.  Oh well.  It was hot and caffeinated so I drank it anyway.  I'll pay closer attention next time I make coffee.Made John a hot breakfast before he left for work.  Packed the meal I made up for him last night.My breakfast used up a lonely piece of turkey sausage.  I chopped it up and put atop cheese toast.  I enjoy that simple and tasty combination for breakfast.Have piddled about house all morning and into the afternoon.  Cleaned the bathroom,using the homemade cleanser in the shower.  Time to mix up more once again.  Equal parts of vinegar and dish detergent (NOT dishwasher detergent).  I never labor over my shower anymore since I started using that homemade cleanser.Fed Maddie and Misu. When they were obviously done, I picked up the food pans and put them in a plastic bucket with a lid so the ants would not be drawn to them.Picked up clothes and straightened the bedroom, made the bed and cleared the desk.  Amazing!  I'm always pleased at how a simple tidying can transform a room.  Proceeded to do the same in the living and dining areas.Sat down and worked on the 2014 budget sheet for our household. If it seems I'm dragging my feet on this, I'm really not.  I haven't got all my figures in yet for income as there are several changes with the new schedule.  Until we actually see how pay periods work out I can't put hard figures down on paper.  What I can do is figure out what we're paying out and noting those few items where payments may vary depending upon income.  The rest demand to be paid regardless of how much income there is or isn't.  This allows me to see where I can adjust if needed and to figure our what my 'bottom line' amounts must be in those categories which will see the hardest tightening.Planned meals, baking, and errands for the weekFound a Crock Pot brand crock pot on sale at JCP this morning as I was looking through their sales ad.  It had great reviews,  not one complaint that it 'ran hot'.  I ordered it via online and am having it delivered to the nearest JCP store which happens to be the town where we normally buy grocery.  I'll be headed in that direction at least twice this next week and will be sure to make one of those trips coincide with the delivery.  The crock pot was reduced by $20.00 so was almost half price.  I saved $8 in shipping costs by planning to be in town within a day or two of being delivered at the store.  It's a bare savings over gasoline costs but a savings.Made cookies, using some cereal that we didn't like the taste of for cold cereal.  These were two Aldi brands that John was just unhappy with overall, rice krisps and corn flakes.  I used some of both in the cookie recipe which called for 1 cup of cereal.  I plan to crush the rest of the corn flakes and put in the freezer to use as breading on oven fried chicken nuggets. There's enough rice krisp cereal to make a pan of cookie bars (my next batch of cookies I think).As I worked today, I thought long and hard about my pantry and freezer storage.  It's looking a little slim just now and I know why.  I'm deciding how to proceed.  I had been stocking up every pay period but I soon realized that I am prone to stock items that we would need in an emergency for power outage...and less prone to stock up for things like a term of being out of work, or having need of eliminating grocery purchases almost entirely.  This area needs to be examined hard at the moment.If we were to have a power outage it is unlikely it would last months or even a month.  So fewer of those items might be kept on hand.  However, for a period of unemployment what would I need?  What foods would we most miss eating? If we found ourselves strapped financially, what grocery items would we wish we'd stocked up?  I'm going to try and answer these questions and then purchase accordingly.  I mean to start this week with an item that goes on sale only occasionally and is listed at our local store this week. Like pimentos it is one of those items I often wish I had on hand and only do have very occasionally.  My dinner today was leftover chicken pieces (leg and wing), a container of the frozen rutabaga,  frozen stuffing, all heated in the oven while cookies baked. I also thawed a small container of cranberry relish and had that with my meal.  Yum! I had soup for my supper.Made a single serve cup of coffee for the afternoon instead of a 1/4 pot.Cleaned the kitchen well and as a last step, scrubbed the sinks with baking soda, scraping excess into drain and pouring vinegar in behind it and hot water a bit later.Waste:  Peanut butter chips.  I bought them some time ago and hadn't checked the jar I had them stored in but just before I dumped them in the cookies (as an additional ingredient because I felt they needed to be used up).  I decided to do the smell/taste test, having found that a few items bought at the Mennonite store in bulk must have been older stock...and these were rancid.  The bigger waste?  Putting them in the cookie dough and discovering it after they were in!  I tossed about 1 cup of mini peanut butter chips.Gee I do hope I don't end up having a daily waste report!Jan 20:  In past weeks I've noted we seldom finish a loaf of homemade Challah.  To offset that I've been trying to incorporate it into more meals.  Today I used a half loaf to make French toast for our breakfast.  I saved the egg/milk mixture.  That will go into pancakes later this week for another morning's meal.I did a good bit of housework before John came in this morning from work.  He'd had a late call so had to stay later at work.  I got nearly all the housework done, except vacuuming.  After breakfast this morning we had Harvest (when we get paid we call it Harvest because it is a harvest rendered from John's labor) and paid bills.  We paid extra on the car loan, noted we had enough money to purchase car tags next pay period, discussed how we'd handle another matter.    I couldn't run errands as we'd normally do due to the holiday.  So I vacuumed...and after I'd finished I realized how very late it was, 11:30!  Here I'd planned to make meatloaf and it was very late for starting that. But I wanted meat loaf!   I found that half my meat was nearly as solidly frozen as it was yesterday when I took it from the freezer.  Phooey!  Meal plan changed to Tacos.  You'll see why that didn't happen when you see my waste, so plan C: Homemade Hamburgers.  At this point it was noon and high time I had a meal plan and got started.I made homemade French Fried onion rings.  I don't have a deep fryer but you really don't need a deep fryer.  All you need is a deep saucepan.  I usually pour oil in to a depth of about 2 inches which is a lot less oil than most fryers will use.  I sliced one onion, made up a simple batter (1/2 cup flour, 3/4 cup milk, 1 1/2 tsp baking powder, 1/2 tsp salt) and dropped in my onion rings. When the oil was hot, I dropped in a few rings at a time and flipped them when they turned brown.  This same method will do just fine for most deep fried foods (doughnuts, fish, etc.).Waste:  A very large pack of corn tortillas, sigh. Another of those items that slipped through the cracks during my back problem.  Long expired. It got a little warm today.  I opened the kitchen window and one in the living room just a bit.  It cooled the house off to a nice 70F which was just about right.Making do with what I have.  I've wanted a second bedside table for the guest room.  As I sat here Sunday night I made up a mental list of furnishings that needed to leave the house.  I noted the table we'd set the Christmas tree up on  and had left in place in front of the living room window...as my brain went on ticking I suddenly saw that table with a coat of paint and at bedside.  Click!  Today I dragged out a can of latex paint.  I found it was very thick, but since the table was a stained wood, I determined it would do as well as Kilz to cover the stain.   I checked with John and he agreed it would work fine.  I'll need to buy paint to put a finish coat on the table but I think it's going to look just great.John washed a full load of clothes and hung nearly all to dry.Put the soup I made Friday into 3 separate containers and froze it for future meal portions. Jan 21:  Since John is off today, we decided to make it grocery day.  We combined several errands: taking off trash, posting bills, doing the banking, filling up car with gasoline with the grocery trip.Reheated muffins made earlier this week for our breakfast.  I split them and buttered then toasted for our bread.I stocked up on Turkey Spam at the local grocery. I like this for breakfast meat and sandwiches. Normally Turkey Spam sells for about $3.79 a can.  Typically it goes on sale every 3 months or so for 2/$5.  I have been just purchasing 2 cans usually but it occurred to me this past week that if I bought more I'd be less likely to run out before it goes on sale again.  I checked expiration dates today and it was well within a time frame I'd use.  I bought 8 cans, saving $10 over all.This stocking up on Spam is part of my pantry revamp.   The other night, John and I made our supper off a not very tasty canned stew.  Why was I buying items meant to see us through physical disasters?  The truth is they can occur and  have before.. but we're far more likely to be hit with a financial crisis of a short or long duration.  My goal is to purchase the sorts of items we' normally eat on sale and never purchase them when they aren't on sale, in other words, never pay full price.  Personal care items, paper products, the few cleaning products we buy, all those sorts of things are included.I took just half my grocery money from the bank this week.  I've spent quite a bit of money and technically had only $25 of this  month's budget left, but I knew that would never cover the items we had to have to make it through next pay period.  Sooo...I drew up a very short list and we managed to get all items for the amount I pulled from the bank, including the stocking up on Spam.  I'm over, but I know I did my best in stretching my dollars today. I'm cutting myself slack because I came in under budget in December due to my not feeling well, even with our extravagant holiday meal.John bought a submarine sandwich at the grocery.  We were given a discount because we asked they not put ham on the combo sandwich we purchased.  The final price was right at what Subway charged, but the meats were far higher quality.John called my attention to the Sunday papers still on the store shelves.  \"Coupons?\" he asked.  We had to pay for the paper but it was half price.  We have the fun of crossword, the sales sheets to use to plan any further purchases, and coupons.  Nice!   John asked for a splurge item.  I could have said \"No way!\"...I decided that we could splurge within reason.  Rather than buy a pound of the pricey cheese he wanted, we opted for 1/4 pound.  Under $3 splurge.I made a pizza for our supper.  I used what I had for cheeses even though I didn't think it would be enough.  Well it was.  I cooked a full pound of Italian turkey sausage but I put half of the sausage in the freezer for pizza another day.  I made the dough from scratch, used bell peppers from the freezer, leftover tomato sauce.  The house smelled so good!  The oven's heat was welcome, too, with heavy duty winds blowing chilly air our way.waste:  I swear I normally don't have as much waste as I've had this week...Onion dip, made the weekend before the New Year and pushed to the back of the fridge.  It wasn't a full tub, only about 1/2 cup but still waste.I usually keep these items corralled in a basket but  sometimes things spoil because I fail to notice the passage of time.  So now I have a second method of helping me track my leftover items in the fridge.  I've been labeling things for the freezer for almost a year now and it's been very helpful.  I use standard address labels, 100 to a package, about $3.49.  I cut them in half.Jan 22:  Let's just get this over with shall we?  waste: three stalks of yellowed celery.  Celery can be overwhelming when green if you use too much.  As it ages and yellows, it intensifies in flavor.  I can see this bunch is on the verge of going bad.  Trouble is I've got plenty of celery in the freezer for making broth.  I don't need more in the freezer.  Must.Use.Up.  The yellow stalks however went into the trash and there's another waste for you. I  need to start a compost heap.Made pancakes for breakfast.  Used the egg/milk mixture from French Toast morning as my egg/milk in the pancakes. Made chicken and dumplings for dinner.  Lots of leftovers despite cutting down on the ingredients.  I put in the fridge to reheat later in the weekend.  I'll likely give Mattie the dumplings that were left and will add noodles to the broth, meat, veg so it at least is a different meal.  I made the fluffy dumplings the way John likes them by the way.  I was busy playing with a project and forgot I was going to make flat dumplings which takes a bit more time than the stir and drop dumplings.It was cold outdoors. I wanted a hot supper, too.  I made a toasted sandwich for our evening meal.Went out to plug in the pump house light.  Discovered the protection was off the back outdoors faucet.  I checked with John to make sure he hadn't removed it (he hadn't) and covered it back up.Jan 23:  NO waste!  That's partly due to not cooking anything today since breakfast, lol.Cold morning.  John has to work. I made that good, stick to your ribs Oatmeal.  We're both liking that little recipe a lot these days.  I think it's a bonus that oatmeal is so good for us.I cleaned house this morning, then mopped floors.  I needed to clean a tight spot between stove and cabinet and fridge and cabinet.  I used my Swiffer duster.  Worked like a dream both dry and wet to clean the floor well.Decided to go off thrifting this afternoon.  I didn't mean to skip lunch.  I had plans.  The trouble was that the plan fell through and I ended up driving further than planned.  I had a late dinner, so no supper for me. In one of the stores I visited today, the owner told me I could have my pick of FREE books.  You know I took advantage of that!  I didn't see anything especially rare or old but I did find about four books I wanted for myself.I found an old fashioned glass orange juicer (it's bigger than a lemon juicer, so I assume it's for oranges) at the first store but I felt it was a little pricey.  I decided against it.  So glad because the next store had the same exact piece for about 1/3 the price.  Now that I can price to sale in my booth.As I drove today I plotted out how I could manage a new venture.Got electric bill today.  Zowie!  John and I talked about it.   It's due to increases everyone is seeing.  I also told him I'd rather use our alternate heat source more, and lower the electric heat to offset costs now.  Come summer, I don't have an alternate.  I'll try to save the difference now (and that means actually setting some money aside to use during those hot months.Jan 25:  John had plans so I hurried and got up this morning.  We had time to get laundry done and hung to dry.I had another day out planned.  John  was going away to a men's conference.  I was driving him over to the town where the group was leaving from.  We gathered up trash to take off with us.  I planned out a circuitous route that allowed me both stops at two more thrift stores and the opportunity to go by and pick up my crock pot at JCPenney.  I called the store first to be sure it was in.I had a good day treasure hunting and acquired some lovely things.  I feel much as Amy in the movie \"Little Women\" when feeding the Hummel children popovers, \"One for you, one for me, one for you, one for me...\" lol.  Yes, a few things for me.  I'll share them in Coffee Chat but many things were for the booth.I bargained a little at the second thrift store.  I'm not a big time haggler.  Now and then I see a price discrepancy in similar items or I am buying a boxed lot of things and because I'm buying I'll ask for a price change, or offer up my own price.  I did that today on some things I purchased.  I didn't save tons or lots or even a good bit.  I save a little.  I don't mind saving a little.  Little savings add up to BIG savings.I couldn't make up my mind what I wanted for supper thought I had given myself permission to have whatever I wanted. I figured if I couldn't make up my mind I must not want anything too badly, so I headed back home.Stopped in at flea market.  I dusted and rearranged things in what I hoped was an eye appealing arrangement that would make things more visible or look different enough that even if someone had checked the booth out two or three times, something different would catch their eye.  I was pretty pleased with how it looked.  I was gratified when the shop owner stopped by my booth to tell me that a picker from Atlanta had been in and liked my things, even buying a few of them.  To be told it was said I had a 'good eye' was gratifying.   Came home and took two frozen Bbq wings from the freezer ( put up as leftovers a couple weeks ago) and put them in the oven to thaw with a potato to bake alongside.  I wasn't sure the potato would keep in the same time as the wings would thaw, so I slid a skewer through the middle of the potato.  This conducted heat to the center of the potato and cooked it more quickly.I am sending this out late and I do apologize to you all.  I've had a rather busy weekend.  I was tired Friday evening and meant to finish this out then but thought I'd do it Saturday.  Well Saturday brought with it a whole rash of other activities that weren't planned, so here we are.  What did you do this week to save money in your home?"},

Every meal on this week's menu uses what is already in the freezer, not the meat most recently purchased (it's dated so I know just which packages to use) or in our pantry.  I plan to keep my grocery list very short this pay period and buy only the items I am out of.  I need to purchase fruit, milk, cheese, eggs, and bread.

{"title": "Shabat Thoughts - A Gentle Rebuttal or How to Discourage Your Church Body", "date": null, "text": "I read an article this week that was earnest and heartfelt.  It was from a pastor who had face discouragement and wanted to share  five ways to discourage your pastor.  I agreed with him...and I didn't.  Because I had a viewpoint from the parishioner's side. Here's my thoughts on how to discourage your church body.1.  Missing church.  We were very faithful in our former churches.  Due to John's work schedule he was already missing two Sundays a month; he had no control over that.  We made every effort to attend church or synagogue on his weekends off.   But between his work schedule and going to church there was no wiggle room for other things.  When it came to family gatherings, special occasions, etc. on the weekends when he didn't work,  we went to church.  And I went even when he did work.   Frankly, I wish we HAD missed church occasionally.  Weddings, showers, family birthdays of now deceased family members, special holiday meals that fell on the weekend...We can't get those days back.  I missed a lot of special moments with family and I regret it.We had a better than usual Harvest Day last week.  I don't expect we'll see another as good as that one this month or next but we did decide that now was the time to stock up on beef.  That good meat market we go to had meat as beautiful as ever and I do think every single bit of it was at $.50/pound higher than it was in October.  I altered my list considerably as I gazed upon the prices.  Once upon a time I never bought meat that was over $1/pound and then I altered it a few years ago and refused to pay over $2/pound.  Well these days it's looking more and more as though I shall have to strive to pay no more than $3.75 a pound.  That doesn't mean we'll eat as much beef as ever.  No, it means we'll eat less and opt for more poultry and meatless options.  It means when we have meat there will be more vegetables and less meat.  No big deal.  I've lived these days before and we survived quite nicely.I didn't price any of the pork items since we don't eat it, but my husband tells me that pork prices are due to rise considerably this year.  He did tell me why, but I don't recall the reason.  Suffice it to say that those of you who do buy pork may find yourselves adjusting to a 'new low' on those purchases as well.  I expect Bacon, which is already dear in cost due to being very popular at the moment, will become even more dear."},

I also found a half apple in the fridge and chopped that into the oatmeal as well. Washed a full load of dishes and a filled sink besides.  I caught water to hand-wash with while rinsing the dishes for the dishwasher."},

Now, as a grown woman who has been married, the impact of the song is even harder. Experience brought meaning.I am, by my own account, a fairly reserved person. I'm not lavish in touch, or words of love, or even that good at expressing myself verbally. I am more show and less tell. If I can feed you, give you a clean home, give you a warm blanket, a quiet place to rest, make you feel at home, I've shown you my love.

{"title": "Weekly Meal Plan - A Pantry Freezer Challenge  Week of January 5-11", "date": null, "text": "Now that January is well begun, I've determined to go back to my old January habit of giving myself a Pantry/Freezer Challenge.  This is where I try hard to shop at home for my grocery needs first, attempt to limit grocery store visits to milk/eggs and necessities we've run out of and SAVE the rest of my grocery budget.  The savings this pay period will help fund my next visit to the meat market, hopefully at the end of this month.  I've only a few packages of beef left in the freezer, but plenty of chicken and turkey and meatless proteins to help stretch it out.Spaghetti with Meat Sauce, Salad, Toasted Challah, Chocolate CakeI purposely doubled up on the sauce. I want to make lasagna sometime this month and having the sauce already made streamlines the work.  The chocolate cake  (and frosting!) came from the freezer.  I put those items in back in November when John asked for a chocolate cake with chocolate frosting.  I just stirred the thawed frosting (butter-cream) well before spreading on the cake.Oven Fried Chicken, Creamed Cabbage, Carrot Raisin Salad, BiscuitsThe cabbage is leftover from Friday's Kielbasa meal.  I just added cream and a bread crumb topping and put in the oven alongside the chicken.  I cut the large bone in breasts in half since they were so big.  We'll have extra chicken for another meal.Cheeseburger Mac, Tossed Salad, OrangesI think I'm calling up a recent menu, one that I never had the opportunity to make due to leftovers.  It's a nice way to stretch a bit of ground beef into a satisfying winter meal.  I will thaw orange segments from the freezer, unless I wait and have this meal following grocery day this week when I have fresh oranges on hand.  Chicken and Rice Soup, Fruit, Cheese and CrackersYes, this is a repeat menu from a couple of weeks ago!  I never did make that soup and ended up freezing the broth and chicken bits.  Well it's supposed to be super plenty cold and I guess soup is just the meal for such a day.  My recipe is Granny's way of making it, so not thin and broth-y but heavy on rice and low on chicken,  thick and substantial and super satisfying.BBQ'd Pot Roast with Root Vegetables, Muffins, Coleslaw I have one last bit of roast in my freezer.  I hope to find a rutabaga to add to the pot roast but if not, the usual trio will do just fine. Pinto Beans, Corn bread, Fruit SaladI'm going to try and find that pinto bean recipe I stumbled across last year.  I remember it had onions...I have some smoked turkey I'll use a bit of to season the beans and give them that nice meaty flavor.  I'll make a mixed fruit salad (apples, oranges, bananas, grapes) and chill well to contrast with the smoky hot beans. lunch outNot with Mama nor with John but on my own.  John's new work schedule kicks in this week and he'll be gone all day long.  I'm going to take advantage of his being gone to go out and spend a good portion of my day thrifting, looking for new items for the booth.  Wish me luck!  I'll get a take out lunch while I'm out."},

No savings in making them from scratch over the cost of a boxed mix, at least not my recipe, but gosh are they good.Oh Hello!  Do come in...Isn't it nice to have a brief respite here during these holidays?  I think so, I do really.   Let's have some coffee...For us, the holidays are over and done.  We seldom do anything for New Year's Eve or Day either one.  Years ago, we had a big dinner on New Year's Day, all the traditional Southern foods that were meant to herald in a prosperous New Year ahead.  I don't mind not doing that and haven't noticed any great lag nor improvement in our usual  prosperity, lol.  John asked me years ago to do something different and have a big Submarine sandwich or something like that.  This year, I'll be going out with Mama on that day while he rests here at home, preparing for his first day back at work.  No celebration, just plain routine and I confess I look forward to it.Sometime after 2000, Katie found herself being escorted from the bus each day by a bird dog.  For lack of knowing to whom she belonged, we called her Tilly.  She only came to the house in the afternoon, walking alongside Katie.  When school let out that year, we saw Tilly rarely.  Then my brother came to us one day and said \"Your dog had puppies under my house....\"  I was puzzled.  We had no dog.  When he described the dog I told him that she wasn't ours, that we'd only ever seen her in the afternoons, after the bus and never at any other time.One morning we came out to find upon our front porch a fat puppy, obviously a bird dog, obviously Tilly's.  We later discovered that Tilly had been distributing her puppies to households in the neighborhood.  My brother, we, a house up the road all had puppies on their doorsteps.  John warned me we weren't keeping her, couldn't have a dog and by any means do not feed or pet her.  The puppy wailed and whined and wailed.  I ignored my husband's instructions and when he came in that evening, he found me on the front porch feeding the puppy milk soaked cat food and calling her Daisy.  Daisy wailed all through the night, keeping the household pretty much awake. I checked on her, fed her, petted her and attempted to do what I could of housework the next day.  About mid-morning she stopped crying. I went out to check on her and found that there were two fat puppies.  Daisy never whimpered or cried again."},

Washed a full load of dishes this evening.I received an email coupon from JCP for $10 off a $25 purchase. I've been looking for new nightgowns for months now.  I like a certain brand and style that are difficult to find, but they LAST. I found the brand on the JCP site on sale.  Two nighties, ended up costing me about what ONE usually costs.  Even after adding in taxes and shipping I can count savings: $18. Hello hello...No I didn't mean to skip our visit last week.  Come on in and I'll share all about it.  There are Magic Cookie Bars to go with our coffee.  I used to reserve these for just holidays but I noted I had an awful lot of chips in the cabinet: chocolate, caramel nibs, peanut butter.  This recipe is adaptable for any flavor of chip you might want to use up.  I really like the caramel flavor of the condensed milk in the cookie with my coffee.Every now and then I don't want milk in my coffee.  I'll open a can of evaporated milk or sweetened condensed milk and have that in my coffee instead.  I can't seem to find a half and half product very often any longer that doesn't have Carrageenan in it.  That is a seaweed extract and I am apparently allergic to it.  It's a sneaky thing, in that I can have a cup of coffee one day with half and half  and it's fine but after two or three days I develop the most irritating hoarseness and short cough. Ditto for ice cream, too, by the way. Even organic brands often have this ingredient.  I do buy Publix brand half and half when I'm in the store, but haven't been in quite a while.  Now I'm not in the habit of scaring anyone about ingredients in food.  I'm not a health nut per se, but when something upsets my system I want to know why.  If you click on the word you can see what Dr. Weil has to say about this particular ingredient."},

Seems to be helping.  Now, I confess I haven't tried it on my feet...but I have been using lavender oil on my pillow and it does help. In the past, I've reserved the use of lavender oil for colds and migraines.  But yes, it does help most nights to soothe me to sleep, so give it a try!  note:  I did try the lavender oil on my feet.  I can't weigh in on this.  I had a horrid night that night but it might well have been the influence of a late afternoon Dr. Pepper...or the cheese and crackers snack we had close to bedtime.I don't know about you, but I've always loved to see checkerboard cakes rather than the old fashioned and more common marble cake layers.  There was just something special about seeing a cut cake reveal a checkerboard pattern.  I've seen specialized pans, but I have a kitchen rule: If it serves only ONE purpose, it doesn't belong.  This rule began way back when I had extremely limited storage space.  It teaches you to be frugal in many ways when you've no place to store things.  Even after moving into a home with plenty of storage I've stuck to my old rules.  They made sense...but checkerboard cakes!"},

I feel a deep sense of peace and I felt it in the prayer recipient's messages today, as well.  We are not certain of the outcome, but we know how it appears at present and we are okay with whatever it turns out to be.This whole business has put me in mind of several things, because I am mightily blessed by you all, and because I've been in blogland which led me to read a blog post about a blessing and then another on another blog and it made me think long and hard.  So I'm going to ramble a bit but there is a point if you'll stick with me."},
{"title": "A Year of Savings: 2013", "date": null, "text": "Oct. 19:  Synagogue for us this day.  We took a slight shortcut on our way to and shaved off about 8 minutes of time.  It won't save us bundles of money but all those 'little' sums add up to sizable portions.On our way home, John wanted to stop at a music center to pick up some necessary items. He paid for these out of his pocket.  I'd told him our funds were 'done' for this pay period.  That's how we work things.  Necessities we'll purchase from our household accounts but only if we're out of allowance.Came home to make dinner: savings $10.  I'm excluding the cost of the frozen pizza I purchased.  I 'dressed up' the pizza with leftover hamburger meat, some cooked onion and mushrooms.  Got a call from the flea market in late afternoon.  I had a higher priced album in my booth and an offer was made for about half the price. I made a counter offer which was accepted and sold that item and one other.  It was welcome news after my disappointment Friday to find I'd sold nothing in three weeks time.  I didn't get full asking price for the item but I will have rent money paid for November and a bit over.  Oct 20:  Made pancakes from scratch.  I made a half recipe but still had more batter than I needed.  I put the leftover batter in the fridge.  I'll add apples or pumpkin to it later in the week and have pancakes again.  Savings: $1.Made a very nice dinner.  The Cornish Hens were larger than I realized.  We ate only 1/2 each, so I had a whole hen leftover. I packed up the leftover bird, pilaf and broccoli in a covered container and froze it for a future thaw and heat meal.  Savings $3.After dinner, I decided the five oranges we had left just weren't going to get eaten.  I've been looking at them for a full week.  I  decided to pare, section and freeze.  There was enough orange segments for a family sized portion of Ambrosia.  I froze them in a quart yogurt container.  Savings $2.No air conditioner all day long. Just wide open windows.  Lovely!  Oct. 21:  One of 'those' days when nothing seems to suit me.  I realized a lot of what displeases me is well within my realm of control. Clearing up is the best way to make things look better even if you haven't the money to do all you'd like to improve a space.  Clutter robs a space of beauty, whether it's indoors or out.  I cleared the front porch of a bunch of junk and gave it a good sweeping.  I straightened out a messy drawer that was frustrating me because it was too full, and for good measure I tackled a few other tasks I've postponed for too long.  Apparently the cure for one of 'those' days for me is productivity!  Costs me nothing and generates a feeling of well being.While in the kitchen this morning, I made our dinner, cooked the chicken for sandwiches and a casserole, shredded cabbage for slaw, washed lettuce for salads,  and got a beef stew assembled for dinner for the week ahead.  I didn't spend a bit more time in the kitchen than I would have to prepare and clean up behind ONE meal, but I now have a savings of time.  That's like money in the bank, too when you're busy whether you work at home, in your home or outside your home!Put a portion of the main dish in the freezer for a solitary supper serving one night.Made a cake for desserts this week and caramel popcorn for snacks.  The caramel corn used up a jar of peanuts (Aldi brand, again the nuts had a raw taste, no more salted roasted nuts from Aldi for us!) we didn't feel like eating.  I halved the cake recipe and made just a single layer and after it was frosted and cooled cut that into twelve servings, enough for six days for the two of us.  The cake cost about $.75 to make from scratch.  A package of cookies that mightn't last half as long costs $2.75 at the dollar store.  I saved $2.00.  The caramel corn makes up a big 2 quart jar full.  A small box at the store runs about $1.59 for 4 ounces or less.  I saved $3.18, plus the cost of that jar of nuts $1.99 we weren't eating.Oct. 22:  Today we decided to go on a day trip.  The weather didn't look cooperative in the least but we went on anyway.  I packed a picnic lunch: bottles of water, a big apple cut in half, 2 ounces of sharp cheddar cheese, chicken and lettuce sandwiches, and slices of the Applesauce Cake I made yesterday.  I'm so glad we went ahead to the mountains because the weather did clear off nicely, the air was just cool enough to really be enjoyable and the picnic delightful at a lookout where a bunch of horseback riders stopped to rest their horses.  There's something rather nice about enjoying good views, cool air and the soft sounds of horses flapping their tails or knickering as they munch grass.  NOT eating out today saved $24.  And what a lovely time we'd have missed outdoors!We explored a bit on the mountain this time and came across a beautiful two story stone lodge, which hosts the reservations center for FDR state park.  John sat on the front veranda while I went indoors to find a map.  I had the option of buying a map for $4.50 but the free handout had the information I wanted so why buy?  Savings $4.50.That picnic at the lookout area was a compromise.  There were plenty of places to park with lovely picnic areas but they came with a fee of $5.  I don't mind paying that for an extended length of time, but to eat for 15-20 minutes at most?  I'd rather keep my money in my purse.   The lookout area had even better views, and those lovely horses, too.  Those were bonuses.  Savings $5.We came home still a bit hungry.  We certainly had plenty of food.  I think it must have been the good fresh air.  I made a quick meal of canned soup and sandwiches.  We had coffee as well.  That was nice and warming.  I bought the soup last pay period at Aldi, a German brand that is ready to heat and eat.  It was good, not homemade good, but tasty enough.  I will keep a couple of cans on my pantry shelf I think for impromptu meals and light suppers.Oct. 23:  Simmered stew all morning long on stove top.  I only had to add  sliced carrots and seasonings to the prepped foods today.  I put a quart of cooked stew in the freezer.  I'll either serve as stew a second time or, more likely, use as a base for vegetable soup.  The added warmth from the stove top didn't hurt at all.John and I both cleaned out dresser drawers this week.  It was time to move out the clothes that were too stained and tatty to wear (kept one set for painting since I am paint magnet), or were not wearing.  Oct. 24:  Chilly!  The quilt surely felt good last night.  There were no complaints when the heat went on this morning either.  I made oatmeal, Butterscotch oatmeal to be exact, for breakfast.  This is an especially creamy oatmeal, made with milk, an egg, and brown sugar.  You could really add a touch of vanilla if you wanted because it has a pudding type base really, just not as sweet.  It costs so much less than cold cereal even adding in the cost of the egg and milk.  I estimate it runs about $1 for two generous servings.  That's milk and everything.  Cold cereal runs that and milk runs about $1.25 per serving, so a savings of $.75.I thought I'd be making a new recipe today but I found I lacked two of the very key ingredients.  Substitutions would have completely altered the casserole and since this is my first time making it, I hate to 'judge' a recipe based on iffy substitutions.  I will move it to my menu for a couple of weeks from now.  The cooked chicken I made will be great sandwich filler.  Savings $3.59 for luncheon meat.Picked enough lettuce and spinach from my potted garden to make a big salad for tomorrow's dinner.  I estimate it was about a head's worth of lettuce.  Savings $1.69 for lettuce.Oct. 25:  The shed is clean!  Yes, really it is decently cleared up.  I still need to finish sweeping and I could no doubt sort out a few more of those plastic plant pots I've held on to for who knows what reason, but it's 95% improved.  I know where things are and what's in them.  I really should write on each container what it is just for the sake of ease.  I found a few items I can put in my booth, as well.  That was a shopping trip without leaving home!  savings $20.Typically in a two week period I eat out at least 3-4 times.  Mostly takeout  or fast food, and perhaps one restaurant meal.  I have not been out to eat at all in nearly 3 weeks.  I can't believe it myself.  The reason why I enjoy eating out is simple: I cook 38 meals on the weeks when I do eat out.  38.  That's a lot of planning, preparing, serving, clearing up after.  I have no shame in saying that I LOVE to cook, I like planning meals that have real interest to them, but I do get weary of something that is repeated that many times each week, even just for the two of us.  NOT eating out these three weeks has saved roughly $50.  About half that amount comes from our allowance.  The rest is truly savings!  I went out today and bought chicken at the local diner.  We'll get at least three meals from that usually.  It translates to about $1.50 per person, which isn't unreasonable.  I paid for it from my allowance, which was possible since I didn't have to make a thrift shop stop this week courtesy clearing the shed. Real savings: $25. Mama stopped by briefly today and had coffee and cake with us.  That finished off the Applesauce cake.  And it means I will have to bake something which is fine.  I have cookie dough thawing now.  I've already counted that cookie dough as savings but for the record, I figure I'm saving about $2.25 making cookies at home.  I get to choose what goes into them, I am pleased to note no artificial ingredients or additives, high fructose corn syrup or strange unmentionable items are in my cookies.  Peanut butter, butter, flour, sugar, eggs and vanilla.  Salt and baking soda.  That's it.  I like that.Cleared the fridge of a few items that got lost or missed this past week.  All were perfectly edible but I honestly had no clue what to do with them.  Not enough to translate into a leftover makeover or just not appealing (soggy sandwich anyone? Nope, not me either).  The dogs are not nearly so picky as I.  They ate the foodstuffs, saving a portion of their usual dog food for future meals. Savings:  $1This morning for breakfast, I used frozen waffles and french toast as our main course.  All I had to do was fry some turkey bacon to go alongside.  Notice the cook is attempting a vacation today?  Yep.  And liking it, too.  And I'm going to do the same tomorrow.  I have meal plans all worked out for the Sabbath.  Biscuits ready to bake for breakfast, an entree from the freezer, salad already prepared and awaiting dressing, sandwiches (non-soggy variety) set aside for tomorrow's work supper for John.  Savings: labor...priceless. Total Savings:  $105"},

Oct 8:  Our trip to Kingsland ended up just being an overnight thing due to cancellation of the appointment my daughter in law had for today.  Fortunately I packed water enough to last several days since their water is sulfurous, so I had water for the long ride home.  We also had snacks with us.  Our sole stop on the way home was  for a treat of a milkshake about 2 1/2 hours into the drive and a stop for a bag of boiled peanuts at a local peanut producer's farmstand.  Under $6 for both items.  It's cooler once more after a few days of humid too warm weather.  Here's hoping the cooler weather lasts because my cooking this coming week is meant to slow the cooking pace and take a bit of time to simmer, bake.  I like these cool days of cooking, I do truly.  We've planned to finally get the yard work tended to, last of the season for sure, as grass has not grown at all in the last two weeks.My little garden is looking lovely.  The washtub of lettuce needs to be picked over, the spinach leaves are vibrant greed, the beets are tall and lovely with their red stems, the peas clambering, the cilantro is growing too.  Cilantro does not like the heated days.  It prefers the cool nights and shifting sun of autumn.We've planned a day out one day this week. Not sure yet which day that will be, but I've got a picnic plan in mind, a couple of new recipes to try, projects galore to attend to, a new section of genealogy research that is puzzling, a good book started...I don't know if I can fit it all in but I'm going to try!"},
{"title": "The Modern Home Economist:  Cooking Lessons: Steak", "date": null, "text": "This past week after our visit to the meat market I cooked a steak.  Until I met John I'd never heard of the method of pan-frying a steak.  We'd only ever had it broiled or grilled in my childhood and that's what I did after I married as well.  John showed me how to pan fry a steak and I was pleased as could be because I loathe cleaning up the broiler pan.I bought a Rib Eye as a special treat for us.  We've eaten mostly sirloins over the past year or so.  The Rib Eye was large enough for three servings.  If you're accustomed to purchasing the thin grocery store steaks you might not realize what a good buy a good large steak is.I've been cooking and baking far longer than the average woman my age...and that's a fact.  Mama began teaching me to cook when I was about 7 or 8 years old.  Just at first, she'd prepare a meal and when I came in from school I was to heat things up so they'd be warm when she came in from work. About a year later she would 'talk' me through basic recipes as she worked nearby.  By age 12, she merely informed me of the menu and I prepared the meal from scratch when I got in from school.  A little later, and I was planning the meals and preparing them, too, as well as doing a bit of the summer preserving, canning and freezing. Mama taught me a lot...but she did not teach me to bake and that skill remained woefully unattended until my marriage when I opened my second favorite cookbook ( Better Homes and Gardens Cookbook ca. 1970) and began to attempt various recipes."},

It's been at least two months.  I've been busy, it's true. August was a full month  and September simply flew away didn't it?  So I thought I'd try to catch up.Starting way back in August, I have to share that after my comment on peaches in the August 2 Iced Tea chat that it's about 50/50 for eating peaches with the skin on, lol.October 1:  A new month, a new opportunity to make the very best of savings.  I'm off to a good start so far.  We had Harvest Morning today.  I set aside money for savings, tagged an 'extra' amount that wasn't needed for a routine bill (three pay periods this month for us) and put it over on that car loan.  It wasn't a huge amount in either case but it was set aside anyway.  It's SAVINGS.  I won't share the amount, simply because I feel that is too personal, but I'm proud of it just the same."},

What a lovely day last Sunday was weather-wise.  It was quite cool in the morning, even at 10am.  Despite the need to do a lot of housework that morning I came indoors and opened the windows then sat down next to the window and just ENJOYED.  The breeze was downright cool blowing in the windows.  It was lovely.I got a good bit of housework done prior to our eating dinner that day.  I made a yummy meal of Pot Roast and Apple Brown Betty.  Oh! how good the house smelled with the aroma of cinnamon and apples, and Pot Roast wafting on the breezes that were blowing through the house.  I cleared up the dishes and settled in my chair with a cup of coffee, planning to get back to housework but the fresh breezes, football game and John snoozing in the chair next to mine sort of just sent me off into a nap."},

Most meals were planned daily a half hour or so before one would normally eat.   If meals weren't forthcoming from their own resources they went off to visit friends and hung around waiting for a meal to appear.  I soon learned that once fed a meal, they saw no point in going home at all and hung around hopefully waiting upon the next one!There was no regular bedtime and no regular meal time and no regular routine of any sort.  Their home was seldom clean and it wasn't uncommon for Mama Pig to show up on a friend's doorstep complaining that the children hadn't done chores, so she'd left home without doing her chores or making supper to punish them. She would stare blearily at you mid morning and say she'd been up doing laundry until wee hours of night because it was discovered around midnight that no one had clean undies or jeans to wear the next day. No one bothered to keep check of the budget, they spent until the last dime was gone each pay period and then they suffered and complained and sobbed and wailed until someone took pity on them.  Only to complain and sob and wail that they didn't LIKE that item or this!Each pay period before bills were paid or groceries bought, they promptly went off  and offered two thirds of their cash  to a local merchant in exchange for a few more pieces of battered furniture or a car that had mechanical troubles galore and needed a  new battery and tires as well. If an extra paycheck or windfall came their way, they took off to go spend a weekend in the mountains or at the beach, took the kids to horseback riding lessons, bought rather than rented a band instrument, or shopped for new clothes for the whole family and never set aside a dime for future needs.  Things like school supplies were expected to magically appear at the beginning of the school year and if they had to purchase them on their own, they wailed and gnashed their teeth and bought a bare minimum of each required item and groused  when it was used up and had to be replaced.I was well acquainted with this family.  My own family and I were struggling along at the time so I  tried to lead by example, I tried to instruct, I tried to help, but alas these Piggies were pretty much entrenched in having NONE and meant to stay there.  Last I heard they'd bought their own place and in 5 years time it was falling down around their ears for lack of routine care. Even now, some 30 years later, I shake my head remembering how very foolish they were.  These little piggies perpetually had NONE.  And it was all their own fault!  They had better income, far better opportunities job-wise and were not lacking in intelligence.  These None pigs had no desire to live differently than they did.  They were forever waiting on a lottery win or an unknown wealthy uncle to toss them a pile of money.  However, that wouldn't likely change their lives much because they refused to learn the basic skills of money management.  They absolutely refused to believe it wasn't a matter for luck alone.  What's more, they had no respect for money, things, or others.  They were and are still much upon my mind when I feel too inclined to complain of any lack in my life.And I suppose on that score I should congratulate myself that I knew them.  Because of their example I've been far more prone to look about and see what I might do differently.  Which just goes to show, even a bad example is still an example."},

We'll just have to live without them or find them in one of the three other stores.So that is my challenge to myself this month.  I didn't save as much as I'd have liked during my pantry freezer challenge but I saved a bit and I do have new stock in my pantry and poultry in the freezer so there is that bonus."},

I began at the beginning and worked them in order of difficulty.  I confess that the HARD puzzles are still a bit beyond my thinking skills at this point but using the whole book instead of just those puzzles I think might be my skill level or a challenge means I'm getting full enjoyment from the books.  I have about six books on hand averaging $5 each.  Fully enjoying them nets me a savings of $30, because it's not savings if you're not taking advantage of what you have, is it? Mar 16:  Lovely easy day at home.  I was so totally relaxed all day long.  Dinner was pizza: HOMEMADE.  And we had enough leftovers that I put some in the freezer for a future meal and some in the fridge for a grab and go supper meal.  Savings $10 over the cost of takeout."},

We should have leftover corned beef and bread so there will corned beef sandwiches for supper one night later this week.   Chicken Fried Rice, Egg Rolls, TangeloI put so many vegetables in the fried rice (mushrooms, onion, celery, carrot, peas, broccoli stems) that I feel with the egg roll we're safely getting two servings of vegetables each and possibly more.    This will be the last meal from our whole roasted chicken.  I'll put the carcass in the freezer to make broth with in the very near future.  March 8 (cont'd):  John washed a mixed load of clothes today.  That consisted of colors, whites, towels, etc.  We seldom separate our clothes preferring instead to wash a full load two or three times per week.  John hung clothes to dry today, forgoing the use of the dryer.  When he came indoors later with the towels he did something I've done many times myself: he held them to his nose and inhaled deeply, \"GOOD!\"  That's one thing the dryer is not going to give us, that lovely line dried aroma of clean laundry.  Fresh air and sunshine are FREE and no artificial perfume will ever duplicate that aroma try though candle and freshener manufacturers do.Peaches to Beaches yard sale  stretches for about 250 miles from the start of the peach growing district to the coastline of Georgia.  I've attended this yard sale regularly for the past few years but this year I'm skipping it, as much as I've enjoyed it in the past (and the weather is lovely today!).  In years past I've spent about $40, my personal limit for the yard sale. I have that amount in my purse at present, but I'm saving $40 and the gasoline usage.  I don't have room for more 'stuff' at present and I need other things I never find at yardsales or thrift stores.  In the meantime, I figured I'd hold onto my money for a bit.Made sloppy joes from scratch today.  I made up my own sauce.  A can of sloppy joe sauce costs $3 these days.  I saved $2.50 making my own sauce.Made my own BBQ sauce, too.  Savings $2.59 the cost of one bottle of sauce."},
{"title": "Weekly Menu - Pantry Freezer Week II", "date": null, "text": "The week has gone along swimmingly.  As long as we don't discuss my mood.  Oy.  Other than myself, things have gone very well.  I didn't save as much money this grocery shop as I'd thought I might, but I did save some. Now the holes in my pantry are filled, save a few spices I am out of, but I want to go to a slightly out of the way store to pick those up. Which reminds me...I was asked how much we spend.  I have a budget of $400 per month which includes any paper, personal care, household (cleaners, minor equipment), pet products we require, as well as planning to stock up on items on sale that we'd normally use.  It also includes a small cushion of about $10 for impulse items.  I sometimes use that for further stocking up, sometimes for flowers or herbs or plants or a magazine though I confess even this is rare these days.  I'd say on average we spend about $170 on actual food items each pay period.  In our area we get plentiful fresh seasonal produce, dairy items are mid-priced.  It's the canned/frozen/meat products that we pay a slightly higher cost for.   Mind you this is the same amount I've had to spend for the past 8 years or so.  We just get a lot less for our money than we did 8 years ago, hence even though we now feed 2 instead of 4, we spend about the same.   Our snack items generally are nuts, crackers (saltines and grahams for the most part), 1 bag of chips per pay period and soda.  My husband has given up a great deal over the years along the lines of snackfoods.  He's cut down on sodas so that he drinks only one a day and I drink a soda about every third day.  Overall we eat better than we ever did 8 years ago.  We buy better quality meats and foods and waste less money."},

And I realize that until February we'd had a very very mild weather.  But I'm no fool where March is concerned.  Weathermen just cannot predict March weather and that is all there is to it.Karla wrote:  Everything sounds delicious!

There's a lot of carbohydrates and sugar in that meal, but I don't think the \"complete protein\" theory applies here... although, the meal sounds amazing and I would eat it in a second, protein or not!  :)  AnonymousGood question!

{"title": "A Year of Savings: 2013", "date": null, "text": "Feb. 25:  We spent the day watching it rain...and doing very little else.  I read that Sunday paper that we bought the day before, made dinner and watched it rain.  There doesn't seem to be any savings in a day like this but there was.  We RESTED.  Rest is very underrated.  It boosts the immune system, it relieves stress, and it allows the body to go into deep sleep at night.  I could buy vitamins and supplements and energy drinks and take them day and night but nothing restores energy like rest.Feb. 26:  I doubled up today and planned two meals from one.  I had a corned beef in the freezer that I put in the crockpot and then I doubled the amount of potatoes.  That's one corned beef dinner and one meal later in the week of Reubens and Potato Soup for the weekend ahead.  I'm willing to wager that we get two meals off the second meal.  The corned beef dinner cost us about $10 which some non-frugal sorts might think is pretty good, since it's still less than take-out for two, but getting three meals  means we're down to $3 per meal.  That suits my frugal self very well.  Savings of two future meals: $16I wanted a simple dessert.  John and I discovered our apples were no longer crisp but leaning toward the soft/mushy side.  I know he won't touch them when they get to that stage of ripeness, so I cut one of the apples in half and cored it.  Filled the center with a pat of butter and a tablespoon of brown sugar and then used wonton wrappers from the fridge (using what I had) to wrap the apples.  I put in a dish and poured a 1/2 cup of apple cider around the 'dumplings' and baked them in the oven.  They were soooo good and the whole amount of sugar and fat was minimal.  I'd priced apple dumplings in the freezer section a few weeks ago and decided not to purchase.  My homemade version used what I had on hand and made good on an item that might well have ended up being wasted.  I think my version might have cost $1 to make.  Compare that to $4 for two.  Savings: $3 After last month's electric bill hike I was determined it would go no higher.We used the dryer a little less, used the propane heat a little more, cut off any unnecessary lights no matter how dull and gray it was outdoors.  All to the good.  The last bill decreased, a savings of $25.Feb. 27:  Mama and I skipped the usual shopping part of our day out, but I can't say I saved money today either.  It was my turn to buy lunch.  Feb. 28:  I started planning for the new month today and began work on the inventory of the pantry and freezer.  I 'found' a whole chicken I didn't know I had, plus a pint of homemade chili and a big container of chicken broth with vegetables and meat bits suitable for a future chicken dumpling day.  That was the good side of the day.  The bad: I had some expired items. Namely one bottle off cheap syrup and 1 can of baked beans.  They weren't recently expired items either, like the box of macaroni that we will use tomorrow to make chili mac.  Losses today: -$2.25I organized things while I was in the back pantry and put them in order of need to use.  I thought about it all afternoon long and decided what I need is a package of bright colored round labels.  I can put a label on each item that needs to be used FIRST.  I made a good dinner today of leftover fried chicken, hashbrown casserole and peas.  Cooked the peas in the oven, letting them steam alongside the chicken and casserole.     We didn't need all the casserole recipe for one meal, so I put up three smaller casseroles for future meals.  I like having these sorts of things in the freezer for future use.  You can buy these little side dishes in catering and cafeteria type restaurants already frozen but gracious goodness it cost next to nothing to make it here at home.Decided to rework the budget based on a no overtime/no holiday pay/increase in taxes took all of our raise basis.  It's a tight budget, what is known as a Zero balance budget, meaning every single penny is accounted for, but it's do-able.  I'll have to toe the line with my grocery budget that's for sure.  When we were at the hotel this past weekend, they put out single serve pod packs of coffee for our use.  As we left Sunday morning, I picked up the decaf packs (just two) and put in my food bag.  I thought they might come in handy and so they did.   John wanted a cup of coffee late in the afternoon, after I'd emptied the big carafe.  I used one of those courtesy pod packs to make him a cup of coffee.  Savings: $.25Savings: $42.00Total February 2013: $ 1,580.85"},

{"title": "Q & A", "date": null, "text": "Terri,I really enjoy reading your blog!!I was just reading that groceries are supposed to take a hike again in April due to the drought, which we are still in.  I'm wondering why you do the freezer challenge instead of constantly stocking up?  I've read of other gals who rotate their stock and keep stocking all 12 months of the year.  It just seems to me that it would be smarter to keep stocking up while prices are as low as they are instead of waiting for them to climb higher.  Just wondering, PamPam, that is a great question. I have several reasons for doing a challenge.#1.  I like to keep my stock orderly, but eventually during a quarter (which is about the average time frame between pantry/freezer challenges for me), I find myself pressed for time, forgetful or just plain slacking and I don't rotate, add or remove items from my inventory list, etc.  When the pantry and freezer are burgeoning with goods it's hard to see what we have.  This brief season of slowing down allows me to get my bearings, discover where we have failed to restock, what we need to use, etc.  For instance, just this week I discovered that I have no instant potatoes on hand.  While digging for milk in the back freezer, I found two Cornish Game Hens...That was meant to be a holiday meal which I'd forgotten and those items didn't make it to the inventory list. So you see this time of a challenge benefits me in keeping the rotation of goods."},

I should be used to this, really I should.John went back to work tonight.  I do miss him, more I think on these Wednesdays than at any other time.  I know it's partly because I was gone a good portion of the day.  I'll slip into my own routine once more tomorrow but in the meantime, I miss him.It's been raining here.  And raining and raining and raining.  Did I mention rain?  I have two inches just from the past two nights and it barely rained at all compared to how much rain we got Sunday.  It rained hard all day Thursday of last week as well.  There's water standing in the yard.  Lake Cheney, as Katie used to refer to the top of the hill  here, is filled once more.  Should I wander out there to wade, the water would come to mid-calf on me.  The ditches are running like streams.  The river is as high as the banks and rather fearsome looking though I've seen it much higher and swifter in years past."},

I'm not talking about no worries/no cares sort of awesome, because let's face it if there's one thing in this world that Satan doesn't like it's happy folk who haven't a care.  No, we've had our share of frustrations and concerns.  I don't mean that at all.What I do mean is that we've faced these distractions and met these challenges with a peace that we've never had before in most circumstances.  Now and then we've flaked out over something and then we swallowed hard and moved on, remembering that we'd turned ALL of our lives over to God,  not just the portions we thought we might trust Him to handle."},

We've never made it a huge production, nor expensive, but we've always made it special with a favorite meal, cake/pie/dessert of choice and token gifts.  China and a prettily set table, a card and singing \"Happy Birthday\" always seemed to be just the right touch of festivity for us.I haven't done much of anything today.  I ought to be busy but I'm feeling the usual weariness that comes on me as the work week dwindles down.  I'll do light work today but tomorrow morning, before my company arrives, I'll do my routine Monday work and have the house spic and span.  I hope to serve dinner to my guest as well, so here I am planning meals.  It seemed a nice quiet bit of work to attend to and gives me plenty of time to thaw foods as needed."},

{"title": "Are Coupons Worth It?", "date": null, "text": "I had a question from Karla this week:   I notice from your menu plan that most of the foods you prepare/cook/plan are not processed foods (which is very helpfully inspiring). What percentage of coupons do you say you actually use from the paper since so much of it is processed foods? That's the only reason I stopped getting the paper but I'm thinking of signing back up for it to use the savings.  You're perfectly right that we eat more whole foods/basics than we do processed.  That's because I like knowing how to pronounce the majority of what I eat, prefer to control our sodium and sugar (I'd rather have a handful of homemade cookies or a handful of chips than sugar/salt I hadn't planned to eat).  But make no mistake there are many ways to save with coupons besides food, like those other things that tend to get lumped into our grocery budget (pet food, cleaning, paper products, personal care items, etc.).I confess that my current interest in coupons is three-fold: #1. I'm inspired by \"Extreme Couponers\" even though I don't think I'll ever have the stockpile that some of those folks have.  I just can't imagine it.  I do understand that many of these ladies also provide for shelters and foodbanks in their areas or send care packages to soldiers, but I just don't believe I see a need in my life for dental cream when I don't have dentures, etc.  I can't fathom the number of products they buy...BUT I learn a few things every time I watch that program.I have been so happy to spend so much of my time at home this week.  I've accomplished something every day except Wednesday when I was out with Mama and that was just sheer 'I don't wanna', because I had plenty of energy and time to have done anything I wanted.  January to me is the perfect month to declutter and re-organize and re-think what isn't working.  So far I've cleaned out more stuff than I thought possible, considering I pretty much have de-cluttered twice a year at least.  I'm not a pack rat, but...well, things do accumulate and now and then it's good to see what you have, discover what you'd forgotten, think about what you own and what you're letting own you, etc.I can't say I'm anywhere near done, because I've only done a bit here and bit there, not even finished one entire room yet (scarey thought!) but I can say that what has left the house hasn't hurt my feelings one little bit.  I look forward to continuing this project until I've been through every room in the house.  I've been  more on target with my menu this week.  I think because I really thought about what I'd like to eat this past week.  I didn't take into account exactly how much some of these meals make, for all that they were low on meat.  There was enough Sweet and Sour Chicken for John to have a portion for his dinner on Wednesday.  I still have rice left (it's very good stirred into pancake or muffin batter by the way).  Then the Shepherd's Pie we had today for dinner is definitely going to serve us again.  Instead of making Chicken Gnocchi Soup, I made Spaghetti Diable with the second chicken breast and half that went into the freezer for a future convenience meal.  There's enough Cheeseburger Soup for another meal despite my eating it for supper.  Amazing, truly, how food can stretch!"},

{"title": "Weekly Menu Plan ", "date": null, "text": "I felt like such a slackard last week coming up with a menu plan so late...and then we barely even followed it.  I don't think we ate more than one or possibly two of those meals.  Some weeks it is just that way.  This week I've put more time and thought into it and I hope that indeed we do stick to the menu plan.I didn't get to make my potato soup, but Patsy asked especially if I'd post my recipe.  It's really not a recipe per se, just my tossing things into a pan, but here goes:Potato Soup:  Boil four cups diced raw potato in chicken broth to cover until tender.  Salt well.  Add a little minced garlic (1tsp or so), 1/2 cup diced onion (or skip and add in green onions later) to the potatoes while they are cooking.  When potatoes are tender, add 1 can of evaporated milk and four ounces of cream cheese.  Smush and mash potatoes around in the liquid as the cheese melts.  Depending on how thin the mixture is you can add instant potatoes to thicken slightly.  Serve as is or add finely minced green onions, cooked crisp bacon, shredded cheddar, sour cream, etc.  I usually end up with just enough soup for three servings (we eat big bowls and very little sandwich, lol).Now, that done, let me get busy with this coming week's planned menu.  It's very warm and pleasant here in Georgia at the moment, but supposed to turn off cold once more, so I've planned two soup meals this week ahead.  We'll see how that goes.  If it remains warm we probably won't have soup but once.  I'll figure out an alternate meal using the same ingredients.I haven't done a Leftover Makeover post in a while.  This was not my idea, but one I found on Pinterest and in the interest of not just pinning but DOING, I realized this would be a great way to use up a bit of homemade spaghetti sauce.A few weeks ago, I made spaghetti sauce while John was sick. It was cold and blustery outdoors and he was sick with a cold and what is better than homemade spaghetti, loaded with vitamin C and the good carbs and rich sauce that make a hearty meal?  So while the sauce was simmering, I was pinning...and I saw this pin on a friend's board.  It occurred to me that I had a partial box of lasagna noodles in the cabinet (a leftover from a previous meal) and that I'd definitely have leftover sauce because I always do.When I boiled my spaghetti for the meal, I let inspiration lead me to a 'savings'.  I laid out the lasagna noodles in a 9 X 13 pan.  When I drained the spaghetti, I set the colander in the pan with the lasagna noodles, removed my colander, covered the pan with a cookie sheet and we had dinner while the lasagna noodles soaked in the water from the spaghetti."},

I had to see on paper exactly what my being at home meant to our household.  There were some huge savings that year, once in a lifetime type savings, but also lots of little things that I didn't even count as a daily or weekly occurrence but as a one time only thing.  Still, the figure at the end of the year surprised and delighted me and really boosted my confidence in my skills as a homemaker and a frugalite.  I saved  about $27,000 by my skewed figuring back in 2008."},
{"title": "Menu Plan?  Oh Dear", "date": null, "text": "I've been missing in action here and at home this week.  Gone for two days and spent today recovering (and catching up on the bare basics).  It wasn't until John mentioned grocery shopping that I realized I hadn't even made out a list...and that's when it hit me that I hadn't even made out a menu!  I'm three days behind and I feel every single bit of it.Well, no problem menu wise at least. I can manage meals just fine, only need fruit and salad makings for those.  In fact, my pantry/freezer situation at present is such that I no longer plan  meals around the grocery list,  I just go by the pantry/freezer inventory lists.  It's only when I'm trying a new or seldom used recipe that calls for a special ingredient that I make out a grocery list that is meal specific.  I really like this way of planning meals!  There's seldom a panic as I gaze at our basic ingredients and goods because all of them translate right into meals.I cooked a roast Saturday in the oven while our dinner baked alongside.  I like doing things in the frugal way.  It was so cold that the warmth from the oven was most welcome in the house (score two on frugal).  I was still so travel weary today I forgot the roast sitting in the fridge, so that's definitely going on the menu right away...and we'll build the menu from there.Roast Beef and Gravy Open Face Sandwiches, Oven Fries,  ColeslawTurkey Kielbasa, Steamed Cabbage and Potatoes, homemade ApplesauceThe applesauce uses up some apples that have been lingering instead of getting eaten as I'd like. Cubed Steak, Mac and cheese, Mixed Salad, BreadsticksJohn brought home the bread sticks for us.  I have just enough macaroni cheese in the freezer to use as a side dish. Chicken Fried Rice, Broccoli, ClementinesI will have to buy chicken to prepare this dish, but I've plenty of broccoli and clementines on hand from last shopping trip. Creamy Potato Soup, Toasted Rueben SandwichesI saw a menu plan in a magazine and they used turkey in place of the pastrami or corned beef that is normally in a reuben.  My first thought was that I'd like that very well:  it's so much less salty than either of the other two meats.  And we always have turkey sandwich meat on hand, so no special purchase required. I discovered the trick to a really creamy potato soup quite by accident last year.  I was using up odd bits from the freezer and dumped in  partial block of cream cheese.  Katie was visiting with us at the time and it was agreed by all at the table that it was the best potato soup I'd ever made.  I happen to know there's a partial block of cream cheese in the cheese basket right now, so potato soup is definitely on the menu.Veggie PizzaI have planned to purchase tomatoes, mushrooms and spinach, have tri color bell peppers, onions on hand.  I won't make a salad.  I consider this a complete meal as is with the vegetables, cheese and bread. Cincinatti Style Chili, Green Salad, Corn MuffinsOne of my favorite ways to extend chili and make it seem less soup more meal.  It's a great budget meal anyway you look at it.  I'll offer chopped green onion, shredded cheddar and oyster crackers to top.  It's also a great meal to prep ahead and serve later."},
{"title": "Deep Cleaning Routines", "date": null, "text": "Angela wrote after reading my Shiny New Year post:  \" Terri, could you please speak about your deep cleaning routine? I would love to eliminate the big seasonal clean. As I get older it is just not doable and I find myself always behind!\"  Girl, I so understand!  The reason I broke my cleaning down into a 3 month long routine was to eliminate the seasonal deep clean.  Yes, it's nice to have all the house at once all clean and fresh but it takes too much effort the older you get.  I'd rather have it continually clean, rather than just once every six months or so.  You'll note too that I said I do these tasks every three months.Daily routines are easy and accomplished in a matter of an hour or so.  I've shared before what my daily routine is.  It consists mainly of the top five: make the bed, clean the floors, wipe down the baths, empty trash, clear the dishes.I divided my home into four zones (five really but you'll see why I say four in a few moments).  I allot one week (six days of cleaning) to each zone.  The final two or three days of the month are usually allotted to maintenance cleaning/clearing in the shed, so I can keep that in some semblance of order, hence that is my 5th zone).  I have monthly cleaning tasks and quarterly cleaning tasks  A quiet finish to the week in my home.  John is not feeling up to par.  He reminds me periodically that he is not sick but simply resting to keep from being ill.  It's cold and cloudy and very windy today.  Ever since we've entered winter season on the 21st the weather has been decidedly wintry.  I'm not complaining.  Winter here means cold days with freezing nights and bouts of rain.  We had rain again last night.  I noted that there was only a 10% chance of rain on the weather forecast.  I should be so lucky with a lottery ticket!Meals...Nothing appeals to my husband just now.  So I am just making whatever I want myself and hoping he'll eat some of it.  I'm trying to plan meals that are Vitamin C rich, nourishing, aromatic enough to penetrate a stuffy head.Tamale Pie, Green Salad, ClementinesI'll use thawed chili from the freezer and add corn to the mixture, then top with cornbread  and cheese.  I haven't made a tamale pie in quite awhile and don't want to make a big 9 X 13 pan of it this time, so I'll try to keep the proportions smaller.Stuffed Cabbage Soup, Corn Bread, Peach CobblerLeftovers from our porcupine meatball dinner last week will be 'madeover' into my version of stuffed cabbage soup.  I'll make a peach cobbler with peaches that expire this month.  I hope it will tempt John to eat a bit more.I wanted to put something on my doors now that the holiday season is over.  Typically winter is my 'bare door' time which is rather depressing when you consider that 9 months out of the year something is usually hung on the doors for decorative effect.  This year, I've decided that winter is not going to depress me with lack of flowers, door wreaths or  curb appeal.  So I've set aside money to purchase pansies to plant in the pots (and parsley and cilantro seeds to sow, nice cool weather herbs), and daffodil bulbs which should make their appearance in a few weeks time to add to the joy.It meant a good bit of work to create the curb appeal, such as it is.  The leftover pots from summer and fall blooms had to be cleared away.  I had to move a few furniture pieces off the deck and onto the patio.  I rearranged what I left there and then arranged my pots.  Then I hung my wreath on the back door.  I mean to paint this door the same color red as the front door, which I love.  I got it at Walmart and it's a mix called Candied Apple."},

Christmas night I settled in my chair as soon as John left to go to work.  I turned off the television, settled in my chair with what had become my go to supper in these hectic paced days, spinach dip and corn chips, a few Christmas cookies and small whiskey and Coke.I gazed at the Christmas tree in all it's glory and decided I'd slowly undecorate it this year instead of all at once.  I decided to remove one set of ornaments each day.  That allows me to keep the tree up until the very last day of this month.  I never leave my tree up for New Year's day.  Not superstition but simply the feeling that I should start a New Year with a clean slate (and a clean house and no evidence of previous holidays).My interest in leaving the tree up this year is that it's our last year with this tree.  It's shedding, and leaning crookedly no matter how much we straighten it.  The top portion ceased to light up last year, so we bought new lights for that section and this year when I plugged in the tree the whole middle section refused to light up but then suddenly did.  John announced this year as the last year.This tree was 'ours'.  John chose it and ordered it in early August and it didn't arrive until just days before Christmas.  That was the year of the dock worker's strike and there sat our tree until the strike was over some months later.  It was a big change to go from an 8 foot tree that took days and days to decorate to a four foot pre-lit tree that took just a day to decorate.  I think this tree is twelve years old...It's lasted well.

{"title": "Frugal Week In My Home", "date": null, "text": "In the Kitchen:If ever there is a month to feel unthrifty in the kitchen, it has to be December.  I find it a challenge and I haven't even begun the baking I mean to do!  To help offset costs, I've been trying hard to avoid any waste.  This week I score high on that.  The only thing I've tossed this week is the butt end of a loaf of Challah bread.  John used most of it for peanut butter sandwiches but that last bit lingered around too long.Made pancakes from scratch this morning and put some in the freezer for a future breakfast.Organized the refrigerator so that all the leftovers were in one area.  That worked nicely for supper tonight. I  just took out containers and we played Catch Can.  I only had one item to put back in the fridge.I've continued to take my time decorating.  The mantel got a little decor.  I've since added the two quail to the mantel (they are visible to the left on the small shelf on the wall).  What's on the little shelf now?  A pretty little red bird sitting upon snow covered pine cones.  This week I focused on two areas: the back door and the dining room table.  Last year I used a pine swag on the back door and covered it with copper cookie cutters and cinnamon sticks.  Two years ago I decorated it with sugar plum fruits (beaded fruit picks).  This year, I wanted something else.  Here's what I came up with:I added one of the pine picks I bought this year ($3 at Hobby Lobby) to the original pine/berry swag and the porcelain quails I'd been using on my autumn wreath this year.  I love the creamy color on the birds. Not only do they really stand out against the green swag they are gorgeous up close as well.  You can see the quails  here on the autumn wreath.  At the time I just whitewashed the birds.  The original finish on them was flat brown paint.  I like the cream colored paint much much better.I was so happy with that, I decided to redo the dining table centerpiece.  Originally I set up the cornucopia with beaded fruits, just as I'd done last year.  I thought it was pretty then, but this year...It just seemed fussy compared to the simplicity of the buffet.  I was setting the table for Shabat this afternoon and happened to see the little green urn I bought at the local flea market.  Wheels began to turn and here's what I came up with:I had a Styrofoam ball that I'd never used, which I covered with glue and moss.  And in the true spirit of 'use what you have', when the moss failed to stick to the glue, I used floral wire to craft my own u-pins to hold the moss in place.  Then I stripped down the fruit picks and began to work my way around the moss covered ball.  This is the result.  You can see the hurricanes on the buffet in the background match the green urn rather nicely. (I had John move the poinsettia/pine arrangement from the center of the buffet as it kept competing with the urn in the photo.)  John says he likes this much better than the cornucopia which seemed strange to him for Christmas.  And that's this week's \"Using What I Have Celebration\".  I'm linking to:"},

My.  Well I wasn't getting out of bed once I'd hopped in, so I waited until this morning.  That worked out the best anyway, since John came in, got called out to go back to work and I was home alone all morning long to do housework and make plans."},

I will be working on the second wreath this weekend.  In the meantime, I'll show you what I came up with for my front door:My little 'Christmas' project, using just what I had on hand...In The Kitchen:  We went a full pay period without purchasing groceries.  I picked up milk and bread and a snack item for us for here at home, but we skipped the whole grocery store experience entirely for one whole pay period.  I spent about the same amount I'd normally spend on one of those 'in between' trips to the store, right at $40.Second grocery frugal:  we bought a few grocery items while we were on vacation because we always cook most of our meals while we're away.  Does that sound like  I spent grocery money, and didn't really have a savings?  Wrong!  I had money set aside for vacation foods.  It's planned into our budget for the trip.We planned to visit with the grandchildren (it was the twins first birthday) on the way back home and because that was another over night stay we didn't want to pack up a lot of food to try and keep cold for 36 hours.  We decided Friday to go out to eat for our dinner meal and opted for peanut butter and jelly sandwiches for our supper.  I think we spent about what we probably would have at the supermarket for snacks and food for Friday on our dinner, so it was an even swap.  And the bonus was not having leftovers to haul about."},
{"title": "This Week's Meal Plan - Gobbleish", "date": null, "text": "I came to a conclusion this weekend: a whole turkey is an awful lot of turkey for just two.  Next year I mean to have my turkey on Thanksgiving Day regardless of who has planned to claim the day.  I mean to have my feast on the feast day and if it's the second time I eat or the first, it will be just as tasty.I am recovering well from the flu.  IF I stop pretending I don't feel a little weak and keep pushing myself to do just two or three things more.  John has been a wonderful help, doing the bulk of the meal planning and such this past week, but I roused myself Saturday and cooked Thanksgiving dinner for two.  I kept the menu simple, no need of four sides and two salads and three desserts for just the two of us.  I made Turkey, stuffing, Mashed potatoes, Roasted Brussels Sprouts, Gravy, Cranberry Sauce, Pumpkin Pie.  I put a pie, half a turkey breast, stuffing and a prepared entree of turkey and stuffing in the freezer.  We still have plenty for turkey salad sandwiches, plus two quarts of broth from the carcass and another cup or more of meat bits.  John's mentioned having numerous favorite turkey dishes.  For my part, I'm starting to feel gobble-ish.Two weeks ago we took a road trip to Warm Springs and got lost.  It was the most awesome time we've ever spent being lost and if getting lost were always like that...Well, it could happen  more often!  But getting lost isn't wonderful.  Getting lost usually ends up with a harsh word or several and every now and then it ends with cold silence and no truce/no surrender flags to show that the war isn't going to end anytime soon.   At best, being lost momentarily spoils a few miles of a trip. And that's just a road trip.  There are those times when we're lost spiritually, not \"I don't know Jesus\" lost, but confused and unable to discern the path and feeling like you're in a black out sort of lost, where waiting on God is mandatory.  And very difficult.  Getting lost brings up all sorts of control issues and fears and anxiety and multiple unknown factors.  Getting lost is not nice."},

This design is NOT my own, nor original to me, but it is my variation on a similar look.We started our journey very early.  We left the house far earlier than we've managed to yet.  It was cold and drizzly and bleak and for once we kept the heater on in our car all day long.  I brought along a sweater and my fuzzy warm slippers, too.  John chose to drive along old state highways to Florida.  We thoroughly enjoyed the change of pace from the usual interstate route.  I didn't take many photos that day.  It was so dark and drizzly and foggy and drear that none of them turned out very well but it was a journey worth making all the same.  We drove along Highway 341 at first, very familiar territory to us as we've taken that portion of the route so many times now in visiting the oldest son and his family.In Baxley, we turned onto Highway 441 and drove South to Florida.  The surprise wasn't the tiny little towns that 'used to be' and still clung tenuously to life.  The surprise to us was Douglas, Georgia which appeared to be a very good sized city, a college town.  It appears seemingly out of nowhere in an area of the map that is dotted with lots more blank spaces than tiny old towns and when you leave it, you're right back in the middle of seemingly nowhere all over again.I noted that cotton in the fields was white as snow, ready to be picked.  And blueberries, field after field of blueberry bushes that stretched to the horizon.  Honey refineries, too, with big 50 gallon drums stacked high all around them.  The sheer volume of honey manufactured in south Georgia stunned me.  I had no idea and I've lived here all my life.I do find it interesting to compare what I see growing now to what crops were grown when I was young.  In my youth, pecans, cotton, corn, oats, rye and soybeans were king.  In my teen years, watermelons and soybeans and pecans were the main crops.  Now I see sunflowers, more corn this year than in years past, cotton, soybeans and things like blueberries and honey.  Of course in my area the fruit crop is mostly peaches, and up north of us, it's apples, but blueberries are a fairly new crop and so are sunflowers."},

Oh well...Meals:Lasagna, Salad, Bread and butter, Ice creamFrozen lasagna from the store at that.  Yes, really.  John had jury duty today (cancelled last week but we were out of town) and I had errands to run in town since we did not shop for groceries this pay period.  I can easily get buy with what we have here but I had needed the trinity: milk, eggs, bread and a turkey breast and while I was at it, soda and something for supper and a few snacks.  We also happen to need fruit but will use canned until we can do our regular grocery shop.  There's plenty of lettuce and cabbage and carrots for raw veg this week.Taco soup, Corn bread, Pineapple SaladI'll attempt a leftover makeover and  use some of the leftover chili liquid base with additional ingredients to make our soup.  I'm thinking a bit of corn, perhaps some black beans, a little scrambled hamburger, some cumin.  That should make it taste like taco soup.  Fingers crossed on this experiment!Alfredo Chicken and Pasta, Green Beans, Green Salad, Garlic ToastI'm going to slice the boneless skinless chicken breasts the way I did the other day, so two breasts  should net me two meals worth of meat.  I'll make the Alfredo sauce from scratch and I'll check to see if I've got any broccoli before I commit to the green beans. Thanksgiving Meal at Mama's, I am taking Jiffy Corn Pudding.Oven Fried Chicken Fillet Sandwich, Oven Fries, Carrot Raisin SaladMy second chicken meal. Ha. Technically the THIRD since Mama is serving chicken for Thanksgiving.  Seriously.Porcupine Meatballs, Mashed Potatoes, Coleslaw, Corn Muffins, Pineapple Upside Down CakeYes, I am making a lot of cornbread this week.  It's a ruse to get plenty of dry crumbly cornbread to make that stuffing next week.   I'll use up the pineapple I opened to make salad and my Lazy Day Yellow Cake recipe to make a small upside down cake.Macaroni and Cheese, Creole Green Beans, Oven Fried Okra, Pear Salad I've found that having a mac and cheese main dish can be a satisfactory thing if I am careful to make a rich cheese sauce, balance the macaroni and cheese with savory side dishes with plenty of texture and make things as colorful as possible on the plate.  This menu will hopefully hit all those marks.And there we are,  a week's worth of meals planned to please, and not a single bit of turkey in the week.

{"title": "This Spiritual Journey...pt.3", "date": null, "text": "Never underestimate a determined woman.  I wanted to attend church with my husband and after that Baccalaureate evening I saw hope shining before me.  I made a few phone calls and discovered that the church was in our home county, albeit a good little drive from home.  I happily informed John, who looked a wee bit like a deer in the headlights for a moment, but he is nothing if not a man of his word.  He did attend with me and while he assured me he had no intent of being there every single Sunday and absolutely no Wednesday nights at all, he did attend with me more often than not.This was a little Baptist church in a rural setting and the young pastor was a gifted preacher.  We attended that little church for four years I think. I objected to one thing only when we joined that church and it was that the pastor insisted I had to be baptized into the Baptist church.  Stuff and nonsense as far as I was concerned but since I'd already been baptized twice, a third time could do no harm. The young pastor moved on after those four years and another pastor came in who was also a young man and gifted.  He loved music and started the First Sunday evening praise and worship service.  He discovered John played guitar and had written a few Christian songs and he announced one Sunday that John would be performing one of his original pieces at that evening's service.  This was our introduction to worship but we didn't realize it at that time!Eventually that young pastor also left and John very much wanted to find our first pastor. We openly discussed this with the newest pastor and he gave us his blessings.  We discovered that our former pastor was now in another county but not much further away than the little country church we were attending in our home county.  We visited and eventually joined the church.  I don't know all the details about what occurred  but there was a brouhaha over the content of sermons (some didn't like Bible based preaching!) and  our young pastor was voted to remain in a rather fierce business meeting by 2/3 of the congregation.  However, the 1/3 who were against him 'owned' the church building and property.  They made things pretty miserable.  I was disillusioned yet again with a church body...when this young pastor decided to step out and start his own non-denominational church, we went right along with him.This past week we bought a Butterball Smoked Turkey at Aldi.  At $1.89/pound it is pricier than most turkeys, but I thought it far less expensive than most turkey sandwich meats and bound to taste superior.  I 'heated' the turkey yesterday (sort of like a 'fully cooked ham' this turkey required about an hour and half of baking to be 'safe' eating so be forewarned on that score), we sampled the meat and all proclaimed it delicious. We're thinking we might buy another one and store in the freezer for the future. Now is the time to stock up on turkey and holiday meal items for the rest of the year.  Turkey will keep (whole) up to a year in the freezer, so feel free to buy as many as your budget will afford and your freezer will hold.Sunday:  Chicken and DumplingsYes just chicken and dumplings.  Katie came down to visit and offered to make the meal.  She said she'd made it earlier in the week but her dumplings hadn't turned out well and she needed to 'redeem' herself, lol.  Her dumplings are full of vegetables and boy was this good!  Not to mention my clever girl messed up one knife, one stew pot, one bowl.  I was really impressed with that. Monday:  Roast Beef, Oven Roasted Smashed Potatoes, Green Beans, Waldorf SaladThe roast was the only meal I didn't make this past week and that's because I spent Friday out of the house and didn't 'cook ahead' for our Sabbath.  I opted to use one of my freezer entrees instead (time to restock those!).  It's cooler today and the heat from the oven is most welcome. Tuesday:  Pinto Beans, Cornbread, Coleslaw, Apple Brown BettyI'll use the wing tips from the turkey to season the pinto beans with smokey flavor.  Confession: I've never made pinto beans (or Cowboy beans) ever in my  life but I know a couple of Oklahoma and Missouri cooks who make them and my mouth waters each time I read their menus. Wednesday:  Burgers and Fries, MilkshakeA planned out meal.  I don't know that we'll go on this day but it's planned for this week. Thursday:  Beef Fajitas, Yellow Rice, Refried Beans, Green SaladI'll use leftover roast beef, browned onions and bell peppers for the fajitas.  The refried beans will be leftovers from my pinto beans.Friday:  Spaghetti Diablo, Green Salad, Italian Green Beans, Garlic BreadI want a make ahead meal for this night.  The eldest son and his family are coming up to spend the weekend.  I can make this and just slip the casserole into the oven to heat while I admire the growth and new skills of the twins and their older brother.Saturday:  Grilled Burgers, All the 'fixin's', Chips and Dips, Chocolate PoundcakeJohn planned this menu (all except the poundcake that's my contribution) for the kids' visit.  I'm not sure what dips we'll have and we still need to purchase chips but this meal is planned to suit the man of the house who says that I let meals get 'too complicated'.  Nothing fussy about this one and all I have to do is set up the food and drinks and yell 'Start!'."},
{"title": "My Frugal Week", "date": null, "text": "In the Kitchen:Made cookies for the cookie jar (and a tin too as it happens, lol).  I used some graham crackers that had just expired.  It seemed a good way to use up most of the box.  Bought a family pack of boneless skinless breasts this week.  I had 7 (why odd numbers in these packages? 3or 7?  Why not 2 or 6?).  I cut the last breast into three thin fillets and oven fried them for a chicken sandwich.My soup this week was a mix of leftovers that I'd been popping into a container and ziploc bag.  Broth from a roast or two, some au gratin potatoes, mushroom stems, vegetables left from side dishes.  It was rather tasty with hot cornbread and all the better with the blustery day outdoors.Bought flour while on sale at the local store.  It was priced lower than the flour at Aldi (which I think is the same). I got 20 pounds and put in the freezer to kill any bugs or larvae in the bags.I talked myself out of stocking up further on two items: pumpkin and evaporated milk.  They are very well priced just now but facts are facts.  I'm only going to use those two items on occasion and any more on my pantry shelf would likely expire before I used them.  By the same token I mean to really stock up on cranberry sauce because I use it all through the year for various dishes.  Brought out a 'hidden' bag of candy when we were low on sweet items in the house.  It is a help to have a little something put back for those between pay periods, haven't got time to make cookies days.Perhaps not strictly a kitchen savings but the ingredients are kitchen staples: I made more of the baking soda/dish detergent cleaner to finish cleaning the kitchen cabinets and walls.  Made 3 pints of yogurt.Fed the dogs the rest of the soup (all from leftover leftovers) after our dinner.  John's not a big fan of my toss it in soups but he ate his fill from this pan.  I thought I'd be merciful and not make him eat it twice.  The dogs thoroughly enjoyed it and it was just enough to make a meal for each of them.Skipped luncheon meats this pay period.  I've a roast beef I can slice for sandwiches and bought a whole smoked turkey to slice for sandwiches.Watered houseplants and outdoor potted plants with water saved in the kitchen from glasses, bottles and dishwater.Made french toast from the last of the Challah loaf.Shopped from the pantry and freezer several times during the week as I ran out of ingredients in the kitchen.  In My Home: Nothing like rearranging accessories to make things look fresh and new.  It all LOOKS new in different position.   Those lanterns I bought at Marshalls were on the porch but when that heavy hard wind started blowing this week I brought them indoors.  That inspired me to make a simpler look for my buffet.  It looks very nice I think.That wind shook the trees hard and stripped many of their leaves.  It also rattled pecans and they fell to the ground.  I sold over 40 pounds the other day.  That money will pay for our stay at the hotel when we go down for the twins first birthday party.  I have plenty on the ground again and noted many more still in the tree.I painted the trim in the bathroom this week and suddenly just felt I had to DO something new in that room to match that pretty paint.  I went through my fabric stash and found a large piece of fabric that appeared a nice match.  Sure enough, the color legend on the selvage had the exact shade of green that we'd used in the bath.  I made two valances and a shade for the room.  I have a bit more to do (need sheers to go under the valances and a new cover on the bench seat).The houseplants stayed outdoors all summer long and thrived.  I have the most beautiful Snake Plant in the bathroom, as well as a small palm.  Perfect accessories for that room.Trudy is a short haired dog...she also has white hair and she shivers mightily these cold mornings.  John wanted to put something warm in the dog house for her but Maddie claims blankets and such as HERS.  John bought hay for the pet bedding, much less expensive than doggie blankets and nice and cozy.Christmas shopping is underway in our home.  We sat down earlier this week and made a list, wrote out what we thought each would like and about how much we thought it would cost.  Now we know what our budget is we're doing all we can to come in UNDER budget.  Coupons, sales, direct shipping all help.Ate out at a favorite Chinese place. I only get there about twice a year, because it's out of the way.  Today, when the plate was set on my table I realized it was a LOT of food.  I boxed up half of it right away.  The cost was reasonable before, but it's even better now that I have two meals from one.I put back a couple of items today as I walked through a store.  It wasn't that I couldn't afford the items, it was more that I realized they weren't perfect for me.  Money spent on things that are wonderful is one thing.  Money spent on items that are so so...not a good buy at any time.I saved a bundle today at CVS.  I combined sales, store coupons, manufacturers coupons and ECB, as well as my extra care card to reduce my total by over $30.  I like doing that.  I get a huge kick too when the clerk is astonished as my total goes down.Clipping and sorting coupons was on my list of things to do this week.  You can see from the above that bit of time paid off.John took an extra shift this week.  It was an especially long shift but we'll appreciate the extra pay on the next check.Free this week: a sample of dishwasher tablets, a cd of praise music sent as a courtesy gift after we made a donation, a coupon for a free 12 pack of soda I 'bought' with coke reward points, a gift card 'bought' with points earned doing online surveys.It was asked if all was well with us: YES!  John went back to work this week after some time off and I took advantage of it and worked hard.  I've been busy finishing up projects, starting projects, cleaning and picking up pecans.  I spent two days this week running errands and another day buying groceries.  Now John is off again and we've got a month FULL of appointments, visits, and projects to work on.  I'm working on a post, have lots of ideas, but time is premium just now."},

When he returned we both realized how broken our marriage had become and I left two days later. And before that week was out I was hit by a drunk driver on my way to work one morning. I went through my own sort of hell for the next two or three years.  I 'lost' the little non-denominational church during that time.  Second verse, not quite the same as the first, but it hurt all the same. I was asked to leave since my husband had joined the church during my 3 month hospital stay and I was the one requesting the divorce. During this time there had been changes on my job.  A woman came to work in the office who had a God centered life.  We didn't work closely but it was obvious in all she said when we chanced to meet that she had a relationship with Him.  I, on the other hand, remained on a bare nodding acquaintance with Him.I sat down to plan meals this afternoon and had no problems whatsoever...That blustery wind outdoors, the gray skies, the chilly air all proved inspirational.  I don't know that this will last but it sure was nice to not struggle to come up with warm weather foods that I'm so bored bored bored with making for a change.I have a November inspiration list that is two pages long already.  Can we say PROJECTS?  They abound  for the month ahead.  I've already begun working on that list, but nothing major to show for it.  My incentive fell away after John asked me to go into town and get a frozen pizza for dinner.  I didn't mind postponing my planned meal since he's put in no special requests for several weeks now.  Besides there were a couple of loss leader sales I wanted to take advantage of this week.  I put 20 pounds of flour in the freezer and another 6 cans of diced tomatoes on the pantry shelf.Veggie Soup, Toasted Pimento and Cheese Sandwiches, Apple DumplingsCold and blustery forecast for tomorrow so I decided this is what we'll be having.  I usually have a homemade soup day in September with the first chill days, but there were none, so no soup.  I'm looking forward to this meal! Beef Pot Pie, Fried Okra, Peach SaladThe pot pie is leftovers I'd frozen and thawed for today's meal.  I'll oven fry the okra while the pot pie heats up."},
{"title": "This Spiritual Journey...", "date": null, "text": "Back in June, I shared that we had decided we needed a sabbatical from our synagogue.  At that time, as I wrote of what that sabbatical had meant to me personally, I was asked to share my spiritual journey.  I've thought about that request often.  I suppose because I am a writer by nature, and analytical, I like to begin at the beginning of things.  So this is the beginning.I grew up in a Primitive Baptist church which met twice a month, first Sunday mornings and third Sunday afternoons.  We met only twice a month because the preachers serve multiple churches in the association much as the old circuit riding preachers did.I have always been curious about things, all my life, and though I was in this church from age 6 weeks to 32 years I didn't 'fit'.  I joined the church (aka was baptized) at age 9.  I joined because my grandfather asked me to do so, telling me that he was dying (and he did two years later). I wasn't questioned too hard about my decision.  The questions I raised were sort of pooh poohed and I went on with the thing, but I can tell you truly that even at that tender age I was very aware that  something vital was missing in my decision, though I was unclear what.  On the day I was baptized I became a member of the Primitive Baptist church.From about that point onward, I was pretty much over church as a rule.  I went every single Sunday that our church held service but my parents didn't visit other churches, they didn't encourage Bible reading and the Primitive Baptist church I attended discouraged Bible study groups.  There were no Sunday school classes.  The branch I belonged to had no musical instruments in the church, nor choirs.  Women were pretty much ignored and it was assumed that they'd never speak during service. We didn't sing the usual church songs but only hymns published before 1900, lovely old hymns with what I now realize were powerful lyrics, but modern day music was discouraged.  The King James version of the Bible was the only bible allowed and members were strongly discouraged from even thinking of looking at other interpretations.  Communion was held once a year.  Our communion service included a 'foot washing' service as well."},

I didn't have enough for a fourth meal, but  I got 2 quarts of broth from simmering the thighs, back, neck and bones.Made a pot of chili.  I set aside enough to make a second meal for us before making chili mac for dinner.I've found a quick and easy cake recipe that stirs up in four minutes.  It makes one deep layer or a dozen cupcakes.  I opted to make cupcakes this week.  Half became Boston cream Cupcakes.  The rest were frozen.I had a bit of leftover ganache.  I put that in the fridge to save to make chocolate butter cream frosting for the rest of the cupcakes later.

Warm Italian Sandwich, Potato Chips, Easy TiramisuI found this recipe in one of the magazines.  The recipe calls for a sliced Italian loaf but I will make individual sandwiches for us.  It has Provolone, roasted red peppers, pepperoncini, olives, sundried tomato spread.  It made me think of a sub sandwich we used to purchase from an Italian family when I was a child and I'm anxious this sandwich.  I think it will be a great meal to prepare ahead and heat when we're ready to eat."},

Or should I make time for a new one?  Or just stack books by my chair and read a bit here and a bit there until I feel I'm ready to settle in for a long,  long spell?  There's a tall stack of vintage magazines from 1925-1959, all from past Octobers to peruse as well.  Of course, I'll have to streamline meals, because we can't have cooking interfering with reading!   Slow cooker or quick and easy meals?  It does depend on the weather (doesn't it? so changeable in our neck of the woods), but I feel it, the cozy season is coming nearer and I'm ready to feather my nest anew in preparation for it."},

After cooling I bagged these up in groups of 3 and put in the freezer for easy breakfast bread or snacks.Made a pizza for Sunday dinner.  I decided that we should go for smaller portions.  John and I agreed that we were plenty satisfied and so we had half the pizza left instead of the usual two slices.  That will make another meal for us.  I put in the freezer so we can heat and eat for a quick dinner on a busy day or for supper on a night when I have no clue what we will eat.I had graham cracker crumbs near expiration and used this recipe to make Blueberry Graham pancakes for breakfast.  I had to add a bit more milk.  This recipe makes a very dense, heavy pancake, so one or two is more than enough for a serving.  I put the remainder in the freezer for another breakfast.It's pure love of leisure that drives me...A half day spent in the kitchen preparing three or four entrees at once usually means I get a few free hours each day to do something else while dinner cooks or heats."},

I tasted and it seemed just right for seasoning.  I wanted the liquid smoke to enhance the cumin not overwhelm the soup, so go easy on it. I let the soup simmer on the back burner for about an hour. I didn't much care if the yellow rice did overcook since it had already been such a disappointment and I was aware that it's breaking down would make the soup a bit thick.When ready to serve the soup, I topped it with shredded cheddar and served with cornbread.  This was  a really good soup.  It had body to it (John likes soups to be thick) and great flavor.  I could easily have served four, so we've got enough soup left to have another meal this week and I am not unhappy about that at all."},

I'd often make something for myself that I knew John might not like so well: boiled eggs with hot buttered toast and orange marmalade, breakfast burritos, pop tart, smoothie...Now I am making breakfast nearly every single morning that comes along ( I think we've eaten out twice in the past six weeks for this meal) and it's grown stale, truly it has.  I need to add some oomph to that morning meal.So this week, I'm not going to share dinner menus.  I'm sharing breakfast menus.Leftover Makeover:  Beef Enchiladas  I made a simple pot roast the other day and had a small portion of it left after our meal.  I'd made roast beef sandwiches and a Shepherd's Pie and Hash in the past month and I just didn't want any of those things from this piece of roast.  I thought and thought about what to do with it and I finally decided upon Beef Enchiladas."},

Froze bottles of water, a bottle of milk and a bottle of grape juice.  These did double duty.  The frozen bottles kept our insulated bag nice and cold,, replacing the need of taking ice with us.  The milk and juice were a planned ahead savings.  Last trip we had to buy juice for our Shabat kiddush.  I thought it unnecessary when we had a big bottle at home.  I just refilled a well washed soda bottle.  Milk, ditto.  I like milk at night before bed.  Why go out and buy milk when I had to pour milk from the jug I was about to freeze?  I just poured into a well washed re-used soda bottle and froze."},

I just throw away whatever is left.\"  Seriously?I confess that I occasionally 'lose' a leftover in the fridge.  Just today I found a cup of cooked summer squash and a half cup of broccoli salad.  I don't like to toss foods but I don't PLAN to toss them!This is where I hope I can help you to re-think leftovers."},

You said the home is paid for but it is still taking all of a full time income to make it.  That seems high to me.We have one income also but we have a large family to provide for (8 children, 2 adults), numerous pets, 2 cars, etc.  Plus a dh that commutes almost an hour each way so our gasoline prices are almost equal to our food budget.  My dh makes an average salary for our area but our family size is far from average.  If it were just the two of us and no mortgage, I would think money wouldn't be a huge issue.I did reply to this via email, but am not sure that when I reply in that manner you all get my retorts.  And I thought it well to address this. It is true that our home is paid off.  Why is it still taking a full time income to make ends meet?Our folding clothes drying rack doing it's job...We even carry this on vacation with us to hang clothes that need to dry.  It's very handy for damp towels or swimsuits.Friday:  I was busy in the house this morning.  I followed my home-keeping routine yesterday but didn't quite finish the tasks.  Today I cleaned bathrooms and vacuumed, planned weekend meals and prepared food for today.There was more leftover rice than I'd anticipated.  This changed my meal plan slightly.  Chicken Fried Rice seemed a nice way to use it up (with half the chicken I'd set aside last night after stripping the carcass).  I use what I have on hand for vegetables in the fried rice.  Today that was: julienned carrots, frozen Green peas, celery, onion, broccoli stems (and a few of the florets cut into small pieces).  I found that cooking my scrambled egg in the microwave took only 20 seconds and made it much easier on the cook.  One less pan to clean up (or if I'd used the same skillet as for the rice, the sticky residue left behind would have necessitated hard scrubbing).  I served simply with chilled orange wedges on the side."},

I know I have several things that can be either a heat and eat meal or a quickly prepared entree that is frozen and may be baked straight from the freezer.I thought while I caught my breath between tasks this morning I'd share my menu for the week ahead.  Gracious but this cold water and fan are just the thing to cool me down while I relax for a few minutes!"},

Crushed the crumbs of the Doritos left in the bag (about 1/3 cup) and mixed with half pound ground beef.  I was thinking on the order of a nacho burger...Shocked to see Katie and Sam coming up driveway.  Quickly grabbed other half pound of thawed meat and patted out two more burgers.Had a pie in the freezer which made a nice dessert for our simple meal.  Good thing.  Mama stopped by just as the coffee was prepared and we were about to have dessert. Always enough for one more!It's fast approaching a new month and the end of the second fiscal quarter of the year.  This year, as my own personal challenge to boost our budget, I've been practicing a Pantry Freezer Challenge at the beginning of each fiscal quarter.  The first two quarters, I proposed we use the majority of our usual grocery budget for stocking up only while keeping new purchases for immediate use low.  For July, my challenge is a bit different: $25 or less per week per person in the household and no more. All You magazine ran such a challenge last year and I found it quite helpful mid-summer to practice that month of thrift.    Did you know that the cost of living has risen 40% over the last four years? Did you know that there is a prediction that beef and dairy costs are about to skyrocket upwards?   Let's compare those statements with the fact of NO raise in pay for the past five years in our household.  Our income is the same as it was five years ago.  It's no wonder that the stretching and pulling and tugging to make ends meet has been such a challenge and we're apparently due still more 'exercise'!"},

Often these days we eat a smaller portion of meat.  Just as a well-seasoned dish tastes better than a bland one, I've learned that having better quality foods is more satisfying."},

First, those books started in April and finished in May:  Year of Plenty by Craig L. Goodwin -   I've been drawn to books about families/individuals who are returning to the 'old way' of raising their own vegetables, forage etc.  That's what I expected from this book.  It is based upon the blog by the same name.  This is the third sort of book I've read this year.  While this book is named after the blog, the basis is loose.  It is more about the Christian walk that this pastor and his family experienced while eating and shopping locally.  Some of the insights he gained really really touched my heart and helped me to see what is missing in my own Christian walk, like a sense of community and unity with others.  I read this book slowly.  I needed to, in order to digest all that was said.  Often I found myself reading passages out loud to John because they so closely paralleled what we were thinking and praying over.If you want to read all about the technicalities of eating locally and shopping local artisans and businesses, gardening and raising chickens, then skip this book and read the blog.  www.yearofplenty.org  If you want to read a book that enhances your Christian walk and talks about these things then by all means choose to read it."},

At first, I thought we'd withdraw completely from life and simply study and pray as we'd done for a period once before.  But our lives didn't allow that just now.  Mama had doctors appointments and John had to work.  The kids popped in for visits, we were obligated to go to this place or to do that and then there were the unexpected things that kept popping  up.  I realized slowly that the real challenge of sabbatical was to be in sabbatical while living a normal life.  To make time for extra prayer and study and seeking God on a daily basis while tending to all the rest, that was the challenge.  And we did.  I learned that the steering wheel is as good an altar as any, as is the kitchen sink and the broom and the laundry that needs to be folded. I learned that time spent in a chair waiting at the doctor was just as good a place for prayer.   All offered up an opportunity to turn to God."},

Yesterday morning I made about 8.  I ended up with 18 cards in all.  And I have about a dozen more laid out.  I need to get more card stock to make those.   I don't really need 18 cards but I enjoyed my play time.  And I will use the cards.  I kept thinking of various people I love as I made them.  They 'belong' to them now so I shall write a note and send them off, I think.  But not all at once.I cleaned and moved books and bookcases and wondered again at my need to have so much stuff.  I suppose because so many I know are moving, I think about what it would be like to pack up my things to move.  I am overwhelmed at the thought.  When did I acquire so much stuff?  And how much of it am I really willing to part with?  That's the bigger question.  I am not a hoarder, but I'm no minimalist either.It's the last week of my challenge and I've been wracking my brain all day long about what we'll eat this week.  It's not lack of things to make either.  It's having so much on hand I can't decide and that's still the basic pantry/freezer items being used, not the stuff bought fresh this month!I spent the morning and part of the afternoon in the kitchen baking: Banana Chocolate Chip and Walnut Muffins, Chocolate Chip cookies, Homemade bread.Today's dinner wasn't dinner but just plain lunch so I'll share the supper menu with you which isn't much either, lol."},

It all started  with CVS who called to say our prescriptions were ready.  I'd have put  off going but I knew I'd forget entirely by Sunday which would be my  next opportunity to go.  I went to the drive thru window at CVS to avoid  temptation.Washed and  vacuumed the car at the car wash in town.  It cost me $5 but for that  price I also got the interior cleaned up.  That doesn't happen when I go  through the automated wash at the gas station even if I choose the  'extras' package.  I also sprayed on wax to protect the car.Went  by another store in town and got two rose bushes for $5.  This seemed a  reasonable expense for roses and I do enjoy them so much.  I think I'll  pick up two more next week.Found a comforter for our master  bedroom.  It was reasonably priced, bed in a bag and will match our  current drapes in that room.Stopped at the local flea market.  I  found the buffet I've been dreaming of ever since we moved the dining  table into the proper dining area.  It was part of a set of furniture  but I asked if they'd consider separating.  It took a phone call to the  shop owner but she readily agreed.  And the asking price was low $75,  $65 if I paid for it today.  I looked up similar ones online when I got  home and I truly got a HUGE bargain on this piece of solid wood  furniture.  John and I will pick it up on Thursday.Made homemade  corn dogs for our meal.  Since we use a premium hot dog brand (I like  Nathan's) my savings isn't huge on this but I do control exactly what is  in my hot dog this way.  Made enough for two meals."},

Not in the heart of the city  perhaps, but close enough.  Busy highways intersect the area around her neighborhood.  She loves her job and her new home and the friends she's made over the past few months.  But this weekend she said she had to leave the city.  She was tense.  Deep down tired.  The city, she said, is too full of noise all the time.  There's always something going on and you find yourself busy busy, running about at the same intense pace.  She said she needed something....something the city can't offer. She needed open spaces...fewer people...room to breathe...that special brand of quiet that only the country can offer. What's needed can only be found along old state highways where cars are few and the views expand before you.Where roads are two lanes, not eight...And the pace is slower.  Where the skies can be seen for miles. and the views remind you that all of life is not made up of traffic and sirens and honking horns and people jabbering away on cell phones in restaurants and malls and grocery store. Where paved roads are not always the order of the day and the dust of a country dirt road seems cleaner breathing than citified air. Where landmarks are part of our past and bittersweet with memory. And home looks the same as it did the last time you were there.Where tails wag when you arrive... And faces light up...   And the cat purrs... And a bed is dressed with a quilt, a bit of family history meant for comfort as much as for warmth...It's good to be home...to wake up in the morning and listen to the sounds of bird song and turkey gobbling in the woods and watch rabbits hop across the lawn.This is what is needed most."},

I know that many countries are hours ahead of our own time, but think of it like this:  One woman somewhere on the other side of the world lights her candles at the sunset hour, and all throughout the next 24 hours, some other woman is lighting a candle as well, as though light were passing from one house to another to herald the beginning of Sabbath day...Isn't that just an awesome vision?"},

He brought Samuel a red rocking chair when he was a year old that I'm saving for when he has his first child. *and four years later I will add that Samuel now has a little boy who loves sitting in his rocker.Originally this was a working ice cream churn and we used it.  I had an annual Fourth of July cookout and friends knew that ice cream was always on the menu.  The churn was electric and once upon a time it was more blue than it is now.  The last time we used this churn it quit mid churning on what proved to be a fairly rotten July 4th.  We had a guest who tagged along with others who were actually invited and she was the sort of guest you just dislike intensely by the time they are headed home.  She complained about the lack of fireworks at Andersonville Prison (it was a very dry summer so no fireworks allowed), complained about the food, the noise the kids made, the heat, and flung a fit (which means she forgot to mind her manners!) when the ice cream churn stopped churning.I couldn't bear to put the old churn away so we've used it for a wastebasket ever since.  This past year the wire bands that hold it together (the boards are tongue and groove) loosened.  I showed it to John and told him how sad I'd be to have to get rid of it after all this time.  One afternoon he sat down with it and fixed it for me."},

Even those that Maddie chose to lie down upon have bloomed, albeit while lying flat upon the ground.  I'm happy I finally listened to my inner longing and bought them!Friday:  John's phone stopped working last night.  We tried all the fixes we knew, but it turned out to be a problem with the ear piece/headphone jack.  Thankfully we've had insurance on his phone and the carrier replaced it for just $45 a savings of nearly $150 to us. I spent nearly all day long with Mama at the hospital, getting her admitted to nursing home, etc.  I ended up eating a very late dinner/early supper at a restaurant nearby the nursing home while waiting for her to be transported.  I ate at a place famous for it's lovely gift shop.  I didn't spend a dime extra on gift items.  And I thank goodness I had the last of last pay period's grocery money upon me to use to purchase my meal. Stopped at Mama's to leave her car (which we'd thought we'd need to do the transfer) and went ahead and 'worked ahead' watering her plants.  The idea was to avoid a stop on Sunday.It was a pretty rotten day all around for one reason and another and I worked hard when I got back home at 5:30 to have the house completely ready for Shabat at sunset.  I was tired beyond words.  My husband came in later and took over.  He ran a tub of warm water, lit candles and incense, ordered me to get in the tub and soak, put on soothing music, turned out the lights and shut the door, leaving me alone.  Not one of those things cost extra but I'll vouch I'd never have done any of them for myself, simply because I've gotten out of the habit of tending to myself in that manner. My husband made the wheels in my brain turn a bit, wondering just why it is I'd forgotten something so simple and soothing as taking time for myself."},

Made applesauce from some apples that seemed tasteless (made a nice flavored sauce though)."},

I've found you! Of this, there's no doubt.  Your head may be IN but your tail's sticking OUT.\" lol  Doesn't that just describe that silly red dog of mine?This quilt top was a work in progress by my great grandmother, Granny's mom, who was called Big Mama by all the grands and great grands and great great grands.  I've had this in storage for years upon years.  Granny gave it to me shortly before Big Mama died, along with a bag full of quilt pieces that had been cut to finish off the quilt.  During my recovery from an automobile accident, my soon to be ex- husband packed up my things and decided that the quilt pieces were trash and tossed them into a burn pile.  I'm grateful that for whatever reason he saved this to pack up instead.Truth time.  I've never really looked closely at the quilt top until the day last month when I pulled it out of storage.  My plan is to try to finish the quilt off, which will involve removing a few rows along two sides to make it look right, planning a bordering fabric and then quilting and binding.  It should be about lap quilt size when finished.  I'll save the spare pieces to use for something else.  Perhaps incorporate into other pieces for family to have in the future. The very central squares are flannel, but the other materials I fancy were fabric from dresses and  flour sack aprons that Big Mama made for herself.  Some of my favorite of all materials is black with tiny little flowers sprinkled upon it and there are not one but two different pieces in this quilt which feature tiny rosebuds on a black background.  I think the graphic print (which has a very late 50's, early 60's feel} and the pink polka dot fabrics are kind of retro cool looking, don't you?"},

I say 'Poor Samuel' because he was working on another repair job, one of those fiddly sorts of things and got aggravated.  So he tossed his screwdriver down onto the truck seat...and it bounced up again and broke the window into thousands of little pieces.  Katie was outside with him at the time and came inside and sat quietly in her chair for a little while before telling us that Samuel was 'a bit upset'. Ha!  Understatement!  We're good at that sort of thing in our household.  Both the making a mess of something else unintentionally and the understatement of facts, lol.I was trying to think why so long since I last had a coffee chat?  I was ill in November with a tummy thing and then there was Christmas and January I had a cold and here we are in February and it nearly mid-month...I'm afraid 2012 has not been as productive thus far as I'd like it to be, but it's not been void of accomplishments.  I have done a thing or two.  For one thing, my shed was completely re-organized and my stuff compacted into a small area snuggled off to one side...all so that we could accommodate Katie's furniture when she moved from Tennessee to Georgia.  She's living with Samuel and has been applying for jobs (and gone on an interview or two).  Her dad and I are breathing a little easier over her as we know that she is in a safe place and not spending entirely too much time alone."},

{"title": "Rainy Days and Menu Mondays", "date": null, "text": "This looks pretty much like the weather here today.  All day long it's been gray and misty with fog with periodic bouts of rain.  It seems like a good old fashioned winter rain, except that it's not the least bit cold outdoors.  It is very conducive to making me long to stay a hermit in my Blue House.  Tomorrow however, is supposed to be only partly cloudy, the only day we might see sunshine until later in the week, sigh.  Love rainy days though I do, a week of them tends to make me as gray as it is outdoors.I feel so much better today. So much better that after doing most all of the housework, I slipped outdoors between rain showers and went to work in the shed, moving boxes about so that Katie can move her furniture and boxes in.  I'd meant to do this in increments, 15 or 20 minutes a day, go through boxes and make up piles for trash and donations...Well laid plans and all that stuff.  Instead, I got a cold and spent ten days doing nothing but recuperating.  However, I was only in the shed for an hour today and everything got moved.  Note that word, \"everything\"...I didn't discard or pull for donations.  I just set my teeth and went to work moving things, stacking and arranging the best I could.  I guess I'll put \"clear clutter from shed\" on the February goal list.I brought a few things in the house.  There was a lamp, minus a shade, that I especially love the shape of and which has real sentimental value to me.  It is the very first piece John and I bought when we set up housekeeping.  It's been in the shed because I didn't know what to do with it, as the color was all wrong for the house now.  But I realized today that it's nothing in the world spray paint can't fix right up!  Indecision now only upon what paint to use. I've decided to start a February goal a wee bit early.  I take many meals alone and as those of us who eat alone know all too well, meals seldom get eaten at a table.  No, indeed, meals tend to be portable and move from kitchen counter, to favorite comfy chair, to desk, or worst of all, are eaten while hanging over the kitchen sink.  I started this morning, taking my meals at the dining table.  I might on occasion take them outdoors on the cafe table, or use the breakfast table, but from now on, I mean to stop for meals at the table and eat as though I am civilized. So I sat down this morning with breakfast and a magazine and brought the coffee pot to the table with me.  I wished for a carafe or something other than the ugly coffee pot but we use what we have...until we clean our shed that is!  I found two coffee pots in the shed, both china, one a tiny little electric pot with the inner heat element still intact inside (wish I could get a cord that fit and discover if it works yet), and the other a lovely china coffee pot from England that I picked up a couple years ago at Peaches to Beaches yard sale.  My coffee shall come to table tomorrow morning in a lovely china pot, thank you very much.  Ha!  I may get too big for my own britches, as Granny used to say, and start putting on airs, I'll be so elegant.I also brought in that quilt top of Big Mama's I've talked endlessly about of late.  I examined the piece and can see where removing some of the squares along two edges (1 row on one side and two rows along one end) I could possibly end up with a lap quilt.  I will need to do a bit of work and buy some fabric to finish it off, so that will bear thinking about.  I turned it over this morning to see if the pieces could be easily removed and realized that top was hand stitched!  Perfectly straight, tiny little stitches.  Further examination showed where Big Mama had obviously used scraps from clothes that had been made (waste not want not, right?) and had pieces together sections of fabric to make up a full square.Tonight is Harvest night in our home where John brings in the Harvest of his work week and we will sit down and pay our tithes and bills.  My short grocery list is made out, nearly everything on it items that are on sale that will fill holes in the pantry and not meant for use this month. I suppose I could share how I've done this past pay period.  Two weeks and I've spent a little more than I budgeted one week then balanced it the next week by having almost the overage amount leftover.  I did use a single boneless chicken breast I had set aside for next month's foodstuffs, but everything else has been a good use of pantry and freezer stock prior to this month's purchases. Now on to the menus for the week:Bbq Chicken Breast, Cauliflower au gratin,, Poundcake with Canned PeachesAmish Soup with Corn Muffins, Baked ApplesCheeseburger Macaroni, Mixed Green Salad, Berry CobblerSausage-Lima Bean Bake, Coleslaw, Apple Hand PiesBaked Potatoes with Chili and Cheese topping, Orange-Olive-Onion Salad,Brown Sugar BarsItalian Pepper Steak over Rice,  Spinach Salad, Garlic Bread, TiramisuLeftovers Smorgasbord"},
{"title": "Thrifty Thursday", "date": null, "text": "Individual serving packs of Tapioca pudding, a double savings.  I used milk that was about to expire to make the pudding as well as reused containers from takeout or purchases at grocery to package the pudding.Friday:  We'd meant to go nowhere at all but as it happened we had to go out to mail an item and have felt rather puny this morning, I felt it best to get a new bottle of Vitamin C and some acetaminophen as well.  Mailing taken care of, we ventured one block to the local Dollar store.  I found Vitamin C for under $3 and acetaminophen for the same.  I found a vapor rub cream which seemed just the thing for my congested chest.  We skipped over snack foods and bread, having plenty at home.John seldom goes into the dollar store and decided that he wanted 'to just look', which is fine for him.  He seldom picks up anything in his looking.  I, on the other hand, too often do.  Today I picked up a packet of flower seed (Gaillardia  or Blanket Flower, this time, a perennial that is easily started from seed).John insisted I choose two new Suduko magazines.  Truly I do get good use  from mine as I do all the puzzles in them regardless of ease or difficulty before I will toss.  I happily looked over the selection and chose two new ones.  Hours and hours of time will be occupied in waiting rooms and long lines and much needed downtime."},
{"title": "Waste Not, Want Not Part II", "date": null, "text": "While scanning Yahoo!news bits the other day I stumbled upon a link about David's Bridal Wear Shops going out of business and the outrage from the public when they discovered dresses that hadn't sold had been hit with hot pink spray paint to deface them and the dresses tossed.  The company, in response, stated that only dresses that had been damaged in some way and were unrepairable had been treated in such a manner, but eye witnesses said the dresses were perfect save the permanent pink paint.Why hadn't these dresses been donated, the company was asked.  To protect licensing agreements and copyrights issued by designers.  The same article also stated that H&M stores and Walmart had been guilty of the same until outcries reached corporate headquarters.  50'sGal @50's Times blog mentioned in an older post that she worked, once upon a time, in retail clothing and it was standard practice to shred and destroy pieces that had not sold on the clearance racks.The waste of it all sickens me.  Whatever happened to donating goods to the less fortunate?  Or even donating for a tax write off to charity shops?  What about wonderful charity programs that outfit girls for proms, or Dress For Success programs?  And it is licensing agreements then go ahead and spray paint the things but why not pass along to a pet shelter that could use the items as bedding?In my great grandmother's day scraps were saved from every dress and shirt and pants made by her hands and sewn into quilts such as the one above.  Even less lovely pieces made serviceable scrap quilts.  Since the majority of both my grandmother's childhood clothing pieces were made from cotton flour sacks, I can only imagine what joy they might have had over store bought or hand me down dresses.I'll not just point my finger in the direction of the big name stores who destroy clothing either.  What about those of us who have closets and drawers filled with unworn, unwanted pieces?  Gracious some of us have held onto pieces until they were in style again.  Now you could resell them as vintage pieces!During my recent weekend of illness and daytime tv, I happened to catch several home realty programs.  Over and over again I heard women who said \"But that closet isn't big enough to hold all my clothes...\" and they were speaking of a closet that was the size of my spare bedroom, which is a decent sized room.  Do we NEED that many clothes?  Really?  Even if you live in an area with actual seasons, I'm willing to bet serious culling could go on in those closets.  One girl proudly announced that she spent around $26,000 a year on clothes shopping alone.When Zooey Deschanel, actress and singer, filed financial statements for a divorce suit, the press was all too happy to report it to the public.  The singer, who earns $95,000 per episode for her current employment stated that she had $0 credit card debt, a paid mortgage and spent roughly $2000 a month on clothing and $600 a month on dry cleaning.  The press went nuts over those last two figures.  The girl who so proudly announced she spent around $26,000 a year on clothes was spending more than Deschanel and not earning anywhere near the same figures annually.  I can't help but contrast this with what my grandmother's told me was usual for their clothing needs as they grew up.  One dress to wear to school, one dress to wear at home for house and field work and one dress for Sunday and both counted themselves fortunate to have three dresses as many of their acquaintance had only two.  This also accounts for the seeming lack of closets in many older more modest homes.  Generally speaking a hook or two behind a curtained corner comprised the closet and held all that was needed.  And when a dress was finally outgrown it was passed down to a younger sibling or cut into pieces to be used as braided rugs, quilting pieces or torn apart and the larger better pieces of fabric used to make 'new' clothes for another child in the family.I confess at this time I have far more clothes than I've had in years upon years.  I wear clothing for two years or more average (sometimes longer).  If I find I don't wear a piece, I generally cull it for donation if it is nice.  If I pull something that has been worn too often and is looking shabby it goes into the 'at home' drawer and I wear it while attending to household chores, gardening and yardwork.  When shirts become too stained to be used at home, as they do, then I save them.  Why?  Because the fabric on the back of the shirt is unstained and often in good condition.  The stained sections make great bedding for my dogs and cats.  Were I more enterprising and had the need, I might turn them into cloth diapers, scrap quilts, rags for messy jobs, etc.  Those unstained backs?  I actually have plans for those that I think will put the good fabric to good uses.One of my favorite bloggers is New Dress A Day...This enterprising young woman takes thrift store finds and turns them into new pieces through alterations.  She began this project when she was unemployed and needed something to fill her time.  Her inspiration was a bin of clothes for $1 each at a thrift store.  Most people gazed in and saw outdated clothing.  She, being a seamstress and something of a clothes horse saw potential new clothing in wonderful unique fabrics.  http://www.newdressaday.com/While most of her pieces are simply altered, I am reminded of a feature from the vintage Woman's Day magazines that ran throughout the '40's and '50's.  The magazine showcased how clothing, sheets, curtains, and even bedskirts and bed spreads were used to make new pieces of clothing for family members, upholstery for furnishings, etc.  Even sweaters were used and at times yarn was unraveled, washed and reused to knit new items.    It was a great use of \"Make Do, Use It Up\" thinking.  Something that I think we could all use a good dose of these days as well.  This blogger also has that \"Make Do, Use It Up\" mentality for old clothes: http://zeahrenaissance.blogspot.com/2011/01/man-sweater-to-baby-suit-mini-tute.htmlI was pretty proud of my friend over at The Bon Bon Club when she fashioned tote bags from old t-shirts and tank tops this month.  She used her bags to gather similar items in her freezer, but mentioned they would make great shopping bags, etc.     http://thebonbonclub.blogspot.com/2012/01/make-do-monday.htmlThese are just a few ideas for using extra clothing pieces.  I'm going to be eliminating some of my 'at home' and 'good' clothes next month.  I wonder if I can come up with a Make Do and Mend project out of some of those pieces?  Waste not, want not, right?"},
{"title": "Menu Monday - Haphazard Planning", "date": null, "text": "I'm so grateful I took time out last week to plan and prep meals, because this cold knocked me for a loop...I had a few leftovers but put those in the freezer for future meals and still need to make the Chicken Enchilada   dish, but for the most part I managed quite well using what I had on hand already.  I confess that after making a big breakfast early this morning, I succumbed to the call of sniffles and coughs and asked John to go into town to buy chicken at the local diner.  I'll share that menu as today's.  The remainder of the meals will be planned using what we had on hand at the beginning of this month of the Pantry Freezer Challenge.  How am I doing with the challenge?  I shared that I actually began the last week of December.  That money saved was spent the following week and inspired me to set a weekly limit for my budget year.  Two weeks ago I took out the same sum of cash and spent it stocking up on marked down meats to use at the end of this cycle.  Last week I went slightly over my budgeted amount.  I didn't plan on a funny noise in my car and so skipped the bank entirely.  Obviously I shouldn't spend without getting cash first!  My second fail this week:  was the necessity of stocking up on pet foods and Vitamins and over the counter items for this cold we both caught.  I still have two weeks of grocery money to use.  I don't expect to need anything this week, so fingers crossed this will be savings for the month since I've stocked up rather well for next month already.I am no stranger to waste.  In my working day, and thereafter when I first began this job of being a full-time homemaker, it was brought home to me how wasteful I was.  As I cleared out the refrigerator one morning, during the leanest of our times, and tossed food  into the trash can (which had to be emptied twice), it occurred to me that each item going into that trash can represented money, hard earned money at that, and what was more, money that was sorely needed by us at the time.  It sickened me...And I vowed to do all I could to avoid ever finding myself in that situation once more.  It took a great many attempts before I finally got food waste under control. I encountered waste when I helped my mother during her convalescence.  She insisted upon fresh milk, eggs, and bread the very day the sell by dates on the  packaging was reached.  Despite assurances that most of these were sell by dates and not toss dates she insisted they must be replaced immediately.  I was never successful in changing her mind and to this day she routinely tosses out half gallons of milk, three quarters of a loaf of bread and a dozen eggs not to mention leftovers that have been in the fridge more than two days, and various and sundry fruits and vegetables.  No I couldn't change her mind but I can tell you that I certainly felt my own mind strongly changed.  Many bloggers, especially those who choose a life of thrift, participate in Food Waste Fridays, in which a listing and photographs of the foods wasted each week are posted on their blogs,  in order to encourage themselves and others to reduce their wasted foods.I've been unwell and so found myself watching a bit more tv than usual.  On FoodTv I found myself watching a 'cook-off' program called \"The Big Waste\" in which four chefs, among them Bobby Flay, visited various markets, pick your own farms and groceries and fed 100 from the foods slated to go into the garbage...Spoiled? No, but tossed nonetheless.  Some of the food was misshapen, outer leaves had wilted, herbs gone to flower, chickens with broken wings or legs, but the food was not spoiled.  It was just not picture perfect.  And that is something that we are so guilty of in this day and age:  wanting perfection at any cost."},

Took about 30 minutes, car looks great.Went by local grocery to pick up the best of the sales items.  I'd been longing for fish and chips.  I had frozen fries at home and frozen fish fillets were on sale for less than a fish and chip dinner at the take out place.  Fish and chips at home, with enough leftovers for a meal for two later.I always cruise down the meat aisle of our local store.  They have great meats and good markdowns on them.  Today I picked up chicken tenders, cubed steak and two boneless chuck roast.  These meats might be going into the freezer (as were the few canned items I bought) but the foods are not meant to be eaten this month (except the fish fillets I had for my dinner).  I just don't see by passing a great sale on any item that will boost the pantry and freezer for next month."},

It's a great start to the first Pantry Freezer Challenge of 2012.Monday:  Tostadas, Yellow Rice, whole kernel cornI made an easy spoonburger (catsup, onion, hamburger cooked together) for supper Saturday evening.  Looking at all that meat in the pan, I realized we didn't need nearly so much of the meat as I'd browned, so I set half of it aside.  This morning I seasoned that ground beef with cumin,tomato paste and oregano for taco meat.  I fried corn tortillas, stacked them with taco meant, lettuce, tomato, grated cheese.  Chance thought it a great meal.  I was just happy I came up with something filling and suitable!"},

{"title": "2012 Pantry Freezer Challenge for January", "date": null, "text": "One of the ways I like to start off a New Year is bringing my budget (which is stretched out of shape in December) back into alignment in January.  And it seems to me a good old fashioned pantry/freezer challenge is a nice way to do just that.  I like to sprinkle these challenges to myself all throughout the year, but most especially in January. So for our first challenge of the year, here are my 'rules':#1  All meal planning starts with pantry/freezer items first.  I try to plan meals that will use only what is on hand.  If a recipe calls for an ingredient I don't have I have two choices: substitute or use another recipe.  #2  Try to limit purchases to fresh fruit/produce/dairy products (bread too if you're not a baker) but truly try to use only items you already have on hand to make meals.Well here we are with the year ending in just a few days time.  I have un-decorated the house for the most part and shall finish it off entirely tomorrow.  I have always preferred to come into a New Year with the things of the year past tucked neatly away.   Not exactly a clean slate, since I'll have plenty of my old furnishings and things about, but as near as I can come.  I try to put away the old aggravations and frustrations as well, but it's a little harder to keep those packed safely away, unlike the holiday decorations!  I found this quote just now on Facebook, posted by First For Women magazine:\"The measure of success is not whether you have a tough problem to deal with, but whether it is the same problem you had last year.\" -John Foster Dulles"},

I plan to go through cookbooks and magazines over the next two weeks to plan out menus for the month of January.  Yes, the whole month.  I found the quarterly menu I did in September very helpful but a little too much all at once for us.  I didn't figure in leftovers and meals eaten out into the equation at all."},

I have the largest one yet only because it was in a different location than the two smaller ones and I am doubly to blame for the breaking of the two.  Why?  Because I'd been storing them on top of the refrigerator.  Earlier this week I'd noted that they slid a little too easily on top of the fridge.  I thought then \"I really should move these,\" but looking about couldn't find a single spot where they might sit, so I decided to leave them where they were."},

I didn't want to waste it and so using it as part of the meat mixture was a great way to use that up.John wanted cookies...and we'd bought one pack the week before.  I had a package of chocolate chip cookie mix (sale/coupon= $.25 for the packet).  I added 1/4 cup crunchy peanut butter to the mix as well as the egg and butter called for and patted the mixture into a pan to bake.  It was very good!I have been very irritable, tense and stressed of late.  Why?  No idea. None.  But every little thing extra put into our schedule or time tables simply makes me feel very much that I am being caught in a net and trapped.After a week of feeling like this I've done the one thing that really helps me to focus after prayer: I wrote it out in my journal and I've come to a conclusion.  I am indeed trapped. I am trapped by the every day, same old routine, nothing has changed in far far too long bit of my life.I ran over the various areas of my life and I find that I am repeating what I've become accustomed to doing.  Not introducing anything new or challenging.

For one reason and another I've been unable to get to the local salon with the stylist I like so much.  And I was beyond need of another cut.  I don't know about you but when my hair looks bad I feel worse, lol.  So this past weekend I broke down and colored my hair for the first time in nearly 3 months.  That was all the incentive I needed to push me to find a salon and get a haircut.  The boost in color (washing away a lot more gray than I can credit my children giving me) was just step one in regaining my hair confidence.So, due to a shorter than usual shopping list and only two stops to make, I decided that I simply had to find a salon while time was all my own.  First I drove over to an area where I'd used various salons over the past 30 years.  Do you know every single salon I recalled was out of business? I guess the economy is to blame as some had been in business for quite a number of years and I am sure did not fail due to poor management."},

All that is needed: 1 pound cubed beef, 1 cup chopped carrot, 1 cup chopped onion, 1 cup chopped potato, 1 cup frozen green peas, 1 can tomato soup, 1 can water, 1 bay leaf.  Cover dish with foil and top with lid, cook at 250F in oven for 4-5 hours.  No salt needed by the way, the soup has plenty of that in it."},

He and I left there to drive to the lake and pick up the truck.  This truck is a 'family' vehicle, I guess.  It was given to us by a family member, we gave it to Samuel, he gave it to us, we gave it back, he sold it to us, we sold it back, and now we've been given it back, lol.  Got that?"},

I tend to think we relax initially more if we actually leave home for at least 3 days and get completely away from routine/work/family/etc and will champion this cause the next time we have a full month together, which should be around October 2012.So much time to read...NOT!  But you know how much I do love to read.  Like many I have a list of blogs...I have TWO one on Internet Explorer and one on Mozilla...and I take a few minutes here and an hour there each day to read through a few.  I am almost always adding and deleting blogs, keeping just a handful as constants in my busiest times.  I've also been collecting links for various things I thought you might enjoy.  Here's a sampling of what I've been reading and enjoying lately.A heartwarming story:http://www.parade.com/news/2011/10/a-chance-encounter-a-lasting-bond.html"},

It was about noon.  7 When a Samaritan woman came to draw water, Jesus said to her, “Will you give me a drink?” 8 (His disciples had gone into the town to buy food.)  9 The Samaritan woman said to him, “You are a Jew and I am a Samaritan woman. How can you ask me for a drink?” (For Jews do not associate with Samaritans.[a])  10 Jesus answered her, “If you knew the gift of God and who it is that asks you for a drink, you would have asked him and he would have given you living water.”  11 “Sir,” the woman said, “you have nothing to draw with and the well is deep. Where can you get this living water? 12 Are you greater than our father Jacob, who gave us the well and drank from it himself, as did also his sons and his livestock?”"},

{"title": "Quality vs. Quantity", "date": null, "text": "Yesterday as I shared my sewing frustrations, I was also looking online at various sites to help explain why I was having problems.  One cause for the issue that was repeated from page to page: cheap thread.  I could have cried, because you see, the thread I was using had been bought for the express purpose of cheapness.  I hung my head as I realized that yet again I'd been bitten by the 'but this is cheaper' bug...Katie and Sam have a habit of rambling through my cupboards and freezer when they visit.  I think it has  to do with looking for ideas of things they might purchase to jazz up their own meals.  However, both commented on a product on my pantry shelf this past week on separate days.  \"Mama, are you kidding me?!\" was Samuel's reaction when he saw the packets of Alfredo noodles.  \"Well they were cheap!  I only paid $.20 each for them.\"  \"You're not going to like it at all, Mama.  You make a great Alfredo sauce. It won't taste the same.\"  Katie's reaction was spoken with her usual bluntness after I explained why I'd purchased them.  \"Cheap is cheap!  You should have gone for the quality!\"  Indeed.This is a lesson I struggle with repeatedly.  Mostly in the food department because that is the one area where I spend the most each month.  The marked down breads in the grocery are often about to expire.  Any wonder it doesn't taste well four days later?  Or that we end up tossing half a loaf because even the bread eater in the house dislikes the texture and flavor at that point?  Far better for me to buy a good loaf of bread and watch it all disappear due to use than watch it hit the bottom of the trash can.  Marked down meats and milk are fine if frozen but I seldom have the same luck with marked down produce lasting half as well."},
{"title": "Current Reads", "date": null, "text": "I said I'd give Turnbull's books another try after the disappointment I felt in Whistle and I'll Come.  I'm so glad that I did!  First I read The Nightingale and found myself immediately immersed in the story and the mystery of the Nightingale music box that disappeared.  This was a wonderful read.  The characters were so real to me that I fancied I could hear their speaking voices.  The story takes place in the very early 1900's when automobiles were less common in small rural towns.  The young heroine is a school teacher, her housemaid/nurse her companion.  How to make ends meet is the first trouble to arise and from there the book goes on.  What transpires over the summer months is much like what happens in any small town.  Tragedy, love, triumph are all there.My second book by Turnbull The Wedding Bargain takes place in the 1930's.  Thirty year old Eliza is about to resign her job as secretary to powerful Dan Morgan when he proposes.  I made one mistake with this book.  I started it at 10pm Saturday night and meant to read about an hour.  I didn't stop reading until after 1am!  I picked it up as soon as I could on Sunday and had finished it by end of the day.  Yes, it truly was that good. Yes, there's a mystery, but it doesn't really come in until towards the end of the book.  I loved the descriptions of rooms and clothes and getting to know the main characters.  I will definitely read both these books again in the future.D. E. Stevenson's book Blow the Wind Southerly was up to her usual excellent standard of character development, description of place and romance.  Charlotte Fairlie is the central character, headmistress of a girl's boarding school.  Charlotte becomes involved in the lives of two of her students, and realizes her own intrinsic loneliness. True To Form  by Elizabeth Berg is a coming of age story.  13yo army brat Katie learns lessons about marriage, friendship and life in general in this story.  The story is told in Katie's voice.  I've enjoyed this book.  Admittedly I have taken my own sweet time reading it, a chapter here and a chapter there.  This book is full of wisdom and observations about every day life things.The photo of the frustrated tailor above, can most certainly be me right at the moment.  I've just left the sewing room where I'd been working on a special item for a swap.  I've had birdnesting and tangles and jams for the past half hour.  I have just given up in complete frustration and came in to look up what the problem might be.  Believe it or not, I was once a rather expert seamstress.  However, as with most things Mama taught me, I learned only half as much as I really needed to know.  I have no clue about how to maintain my machine you see...and no manual to the thing to help either.  So off to do an internet search and now I know how to fix the problem (it's supposed to be very simple) and I'm happy that at least two things I was convinced were the issue likely are part of the trouble.  Now to get it all fixed up and start over again.  But not until tomorrow. I learned long ago that sewing for me is one of those jobs it's best to put off until tomorrow if you can't seem to get things to go right today."},
{"title": "Being a Helpmeet", "date": null, "text": "I don't believe when I was first married I thought too much about what being a wife really means.  By the time I'd been through the hurt of a divorce, I found that attending a wedding was a sweet agony.  The marriage vows, as they were read off by the pastors, were especially meaningful and I was aware of my own failings as a wife. After I became a Christian I read the New Testament and the words Paul wrote to wives about being submissive to their husbands.  I took these things to heart. Even so, when I took my vows with John, I still had little idea of the full meaning of what it is to be a wife.The world view of a wife tends to be that the woman is stepping into a protective covenant, that she is weaker and needs that additional protection.  I was ready to embrace the idea of myself as a 'weaker' sex after being placed in a lead role in my first marriage.  I had no problem with the idea of being submissive to my husband. And yet...I struggled. I'd been an independent woman.  I was not, am not, a feminist.   It seemed to me there was something I'd missed, however.This past week I think I discovered what that was.  John and I were watching a ministry channel and saw a telecast of Mike Barber ministries.  The pastor who spoke took his sermon from Genesis, about Adam and the creation of Eve.  He began talking to the women (who were prisoners) about the need of every woman to be strong in who she is.  Not equal. Not better than a man.  But strong in order to go into a relationship as a partner to man.  That spoke volumes to me.  My background is a background of strong women.  Women capable of standing on their own two feet."},

And of course, I love gray and white so much that I painted our  sheds gray with white trim (which goes nicely with their red roofs). I  happen to love my gray cat (who is referred to as a 'blue' due to the  deep hue of gray she is).

I was disappointed in Whistle and I Will Come.  It is a mystery of sorts and I was pretty sure I knew whodunit and I was right but I found it disappointing how the conclusion of the mystery was settled.  I failed to find the depth of character development I'd found in my previous reading of her work.  I also felt the book was wrapped up a little too quickly.  It almost seemed as though there were a page limit and the book had to be finished within that limit.  Most unsatisfactory.

{"title": "Ten Things I Learned from the All You Grocery Challenge", "date": null, "text": "Forgive the lack of pictures with these first few posts. I wanted to find something new instead of the same images I've used over and over again.  Give me time and I'll have some newer images.Thank you to those of you who are coming along for this new journey.  I admit earlier today, just after I'd hit 'publish' and submitted the final PennyAnn post, I was talking to Samuel (aka Alan) and told him I'd just 'killed' Penny Ann.  His initial shocked reaction of \"WHY?\" made my stomach sink.  Had I made a huge mistake?  Had I really spent enough time making this decision over the past two years?  Yeah.  That's the way my mind works.  Then he said, \"Well, I can see why you might feel you need a change after ten years...\"  Whew!  Katie was more to the point with her remark.  \"It's about time!\"  My girl never wastes words or fears sharing her opinion.In honesty, it was a hard decision to make to walk away from a fairly popular format with a good following.  John and I talked about it at length, I spent a lot of time in prayer.  I didn't make this decision lightly.  I think it says something of my current mindset that I was so quick to worry about the decision once I'd sent the final post.  I note a certain lack of confidence that no doubt needs to be changed.While the main focus of this blog is not to be solely frugal living, I did want to share what I learned from a recent challenge. I've just finished participating in the All You grocery challenge.  I didn't submit my entry but did follow the guidelines. I spent an average of $52 per week, which is close enough to $50 to suit me. I did the challenge to see if I could manage.  Truth: I wanted to see if I still had Ninja Savings skills.  I think the most revealing thing about this challenge was not how to trim costs but what I discovered as I participated.  1.  I don't know how much to cook.  All of my life I've cooked for five or more.  It was hard to adjust to our smaller family of three and it's been hard to adjust to cooking for one and two.  With John's work schedule I often end up cooking just for me during the work week.  I've tried to cope with this by making half recipes, freezing the main portion of a recipe and simply holding out a single portion for myself, or making foods that will adapt well to his requested salad/sandwich work lunch.  Some days are easier than others in that respect.  Most days are a fail.  I grow to loathe a recipe by the time I've eaten it two or three or four times in a month.Say goodbye to Penny Ann.  Say hello to me.Still a bona fide homemaker, writer, country girl, wife, mother, grandmother, member of the Bon Bon Club... but not Penny Ann.  Lest you think this change is sudden, believe me it's not.  I've been struggling against the constraints of being a one dimensional character for about two years now but I just couldn't bring myself to 'kill' Penny Ann.  She has been a fun sort of character to be and a safe place to hide from the realities of a not so perfect life.  Penny Ann was good at coping and covering.  Me....I stumble and fumble through and seem to come out on top at the end.  I find more than ever I need to be authentic.  So, hello."}
