{"title": "MY BEST INTERVIEW EVER...", "date": "Sunday, June 25, 2023", "text": "Hi folks,Well, my Italian publisher, Elliot Edizioni, will be coming out with another of my novels--THE BITCH--in December. I'm really pumped. They experienced great sales and great reviews with HARD TIMES and THE DEATH OF TARPONS (Retitled THE DEATH OF THE SILVER KINGS). I more than earned out my advance with each. Plus, they're just fantastic people to work with!So, it is to commemorate this upcoming publication that I'm reprinting the very best interview I've ever been privileged to take part in, one with the brilliant writer and interviewer, Richard Godwin, based on the original publication of THE BITCH.Hope you enjoy the read!ChinWag At The Slaughterhouse: Interview With Les EdgertonPosted on June 20, 2012 by richardgodwinCrime fiction has many styles, there is theformulaic and the safe, there is the whodunit and the forensic, among others.There are writers who try to take on the image of crime, and there are thosewriters who know exactly what they are writing about. Les Edgerton is one suchwriter. He is a rare breed. Les is a highly literate man who has seen life frominside and outside a prison and knows more about writing than most reviewersfor the establishment journals. He is the author of some of the grittiest andmost incisive crime fiction out there, as his novel The Bitch illustrates. Itis not for those who seek a morality inside a genre which, if realistic, oughtto, on balance, deny it, it is for those who want to read a real crime storytold by a writer at the top of his game. Les met me at The Slaughterhouse,where we talked about the sanitisation of crime and No Country For Old Men.Doyou think that most readers of crime fiction want to read about real crime, ora sanitised version of it with a morally conservative ending?Tough question! It depends on what kind of “crimefiction” the reader is reading. If they’re reading cozies, or detective novels,or most of the subgenres, they probably want that morally conservative ending.For instance, those who like Jack Reacher want him to wreck havoc on the badguys in particularly violent ways. Same for the fans of Harlen Coben, JoeFinder, Robert Crais and most bestselling crime writers.I think most of those readers gravitate to like whatI call “daydream” stories. Fairly superficial, in that they often operate on avengeance level. Common plot—similar to the “skinny kid goes to the beach tosee the girl he’s secretly in love with and hoods find him and depants him andembarrass him in front of her and he goes to the gym and lifts weights andlearns a martial art and comes back and kicks their asses and gets the girl.”Same plot as the Charles Bronson movies, the Rocky Movies, etc. Revenge rules.Very definitely a kind of “morality” story, especially the endings.But, while I enjoy much of that kind of fiction andread it often, I’m more interested in dark or noir story and I suspect thosereaders are more interested in real crime, or, to be more particular, in real criminals.I don’t think it’s so much the crime itself that attracts the noirreader as it is the sensibility of the criminal character.My idea of noir is that it’s closer to the Jungianidea of story. The “nightdream” story. Not “nightmare” although it can be anightmare, but the night dream, which is without a moral bias. As youknow, Carl Jung felt that since language was composed of symbols, communicatingvia language was flawed and contorted truth as it added a layer between truthand actual communication. He felt that real truth was revealed through dreams(i.e., the “nightdream” definition), in which the barrier of language (symbols)was overcome via the images the subconscious revealed in the dream state. Thatif you could decipher dreams properly, you could decode the real truth of theindividual. The nightdream kind of story operates on this level and this iswhat I feel noir is. I don’t think it’s a stretch to posit that WilliamFaulkner came up with stream-of-consciousness writing as he was nothing if nota noir writer. He found a way to make language less symbolic (in some ways—inother ways it’s even more symbolic) with this technique.Noir requires a higher level of participation fromthe reader. The reader who delves into the pages of Cormac McCarthy has to domore work than the reader of Lee Child’s work. This isn’t a pejorative commentagainst Mr. Child at all—I’m simply using his well-known body of work tofurther the definitions. Noir is less cinematic and more literary. In MarshallMcLuhan’s vision, a novel such as Heath Lowrance’s The Bastard Handoccupies a “hotter” place on the “hot media” scale than does The ConcreteBlonde by Michael Connelly.There’s an interesting element at work within crimefiction readers of all stripes than in readers of other literary genres. Inother genres—say romance, for instance—the reader is a person who probably hasa first-hand experience with love or sex. They bring at least a minimum amountof experience with them as they approach the story. They’ve been between thesheets themselves and know what a meaningful look looks like and how to createthe “two-backed beast.” In other words, those who read a Shirley Jump novelhave an experiential knowledge of the subject matter.Lots of cowboys read Westerns.Lots of doctors read medical thrillers.Lots of lawyers read legal thrillers.Lots of cops read detective thrillers.Lots of people who came from dysfunctionalchildhoods read memoirs.And, to quote Kurt Vonnegut who was always thesmartest guy in whatever room he was in: “And so it goes.”The point is, the fans of most crime fiction(including noir) don’t feel the same level of identification with thecharacters in the story as do readers of other genres. You can’t say, forinstance, that “lots of criminals read crime novels.”Crime fiction in general and noir in particular areperhaps the only genres that have very few readers who come from the sameranks. The “same ranks” would be… criminals. And, in proportion, very fewcriminals read anything, and in particular, even fewer read noir… or are evenaware of its existence. Noir isn’t going to be found in many prison libraries.Zane Grey books are as close as it comes to anything noirish.The thing is, most inmates of state prisons aren’twell-educated. When I was in Pendleton, the average educational level was aboutthird grade. In federal joints, it’s higher, but for a large percentage ofthose folks, I wouldn’t consider them true criminals. White collar crime justisn’t the same as sticking a gun in the face of the liquor store dude who’s gothis own meathook eight inches away from the sawed-off under the counter. Thefederal prisons are vastly different than state joints also.And, yes, I do know that there are murderers andother mean-spirited types in federal joints. Just not nearly as many as instate joints. Not even close. A lot more accountants and lawyers andpoliticians in federal prisons… You can write that down.What does all this have to do with the question?Well, the question was: Do you think that most readers of crime fiction wantto read about real crime, or a sanitised version of it with a morallyconservative ending?Truth is, most readers of crime fiction don’t have aclue what real crime is and how the mind of a real criminal works. I was madeaware of that when my novel Just Like That came out and a number ofreviewers stated that they had no idea the criminal mind worked like it did formy protagonist Jake in that story. Some of the reviewers were crime writersthemselves. Well… most criminals think and act exactly like Jake does. Readersof crime fiction were surprised by Jake because the only fiction they’d readwas from the pov of writers who… weren’t criminals. Writers who obtained theirknowledge of crime and criminals primarily from the same kinds of books theywrite themselves. Or worse—from movies…Most readers of crime fiction simply want to live abit vicariously, just as do most writers of crime fiction. It’s kind of neat toget close to real crime without having any of it actually get on you. It’s amindset I used to use to my advantage with ladies in my salad days… Bad boysare very aware of the “bad boy syndrome…” There are those readers who venturecloser to the criminal than do others. Most find it fairly comfortable to getclose to a larger-than-life almost cartoon character superhero like Reacherthan they do to a guy like Jake Mayes who sticks his shank into Toles’ gutsimply because he didn’t know his name and therefore disrespected him. And ismostly curious in watching his eyes to see how they change as he dies. That’s tooclose for many folks. That’s close enough it may rub off or it may make themaware that deep down, they’re very close to Jake in ways they don’t want toadmit.Noir approaches the true nihilistic nature of man better than most genres.Which means it will never take up a lot of shelf space at Barnes & Noble.Crime fiction will. It’s safe to read about the samekind of character one might encounter on their Gameboy or at the multiplex.It’s kind of fun to imagine oneself as that skinny kid on the beach whodevelops muscles the size of Buicks and creams the mean bullies. It’s a bit tooscary to imagine oneself as the Everyman who simply pulls the trigger onsomeone who didn’t remember his name. Even though we’re all very close to thatguy… Nobody’s scared of a cartoon. Most people are by a real-life badass.Crime fiction readers are the ones who cross to theother side of the street when they see three black dudes wearing hoodiesapproaching…Noir readers are the ones who keep on walking andput their hands in their jacket pocket to be sure their nine is there…I can write noir realistically because I stillretain the same mindset I did when I was a practicing outlaw. I don’t commitcrimes anymore not because I’ve had my “come-to-Jesus” moment or that I justwant to be a productive, contributing citizen to society. I don’t commit ‘embecause I don’t want to go back to prison. It’s that simple. Being on thebricks is just a lot more fun. And, the food’s better.If anyone wants to know how criminals really think,just read Just Like That or The Bitch. And, then, think aboutthis. There are currently about 3 million people in the joint. That means thereare probably at least 3-5 times that number who’ve been in prison and are nowout on the bricks. Living in your neighborhood, most likely. Most just don’tknow that as they think criminals look like what Central Casting comes up withfor movies… And, they assume they all move to the slums when they get out or inworse neighborhoods than they live in.Right…If you think most criminals are like what you readin books or see on television or in the movies, consider that while I’m not thenorm, I did spend time in the joint. And, I also taught college classes, cuthair, and coached little league. I’m not the norm… but I’m not far off. Theguys I hung out with in Pendleton were pretty much like the guys I hung out withat the local American Legion post or down at the neighborhood Starbucks. Youmay be closer to getting some on you than you imagine…My short answer to the question is that I think mostreaders want to read a sanitized version with a morally conservative ending.That doesn’t require a genius to figure out or a government study. Hang aroundthe checkout line at your local B&N and see what’s selling. More people buyLee Child than they do Allan Guthrie even though both writers are supremelygifted.“Youknow what date is on this coin?”What do you make of Anton Chigurh’s philosophy in No Country For Old Men?Man! You’re going to make me have to think, aren’tyou, Richard!Okay. Here goes. I’ve never read an interview ofMcCarthy’s or any articles on his book so this is purely my opinion and that’sall.First, what characters do or say isn’t necessarilythe author on the page. Often, they’re just what they seem to be. A character.That includes philosophies like that expressed by Chigurh in the coin tossscene. On the surface, it expresses a fatalistic view of life. A Calvinisticbelief in predestination. Ordered by an omniscient God. That hoary trope, thatinfamous “butterfly that flapped its wings in South America” beginning a chainof events that resulted, weeks later in a “tsunami in Indonesia” kind of thing.We’ve seen this before, notably in Ray Bradbury’s short story, “A Sound ofThunder.” And, ol’ Ray adopted it from Edward Lorenz and some other proponentsof chaos theory. One might posit that this is McCarthy’s personal philosophy. Idon’t know if it is or if it isn’t and I don’t think it matters.I only say this because too many times readers makethis kind of absurd leap—assuming the character is the author or represents theauthor’s beliefs or philosophies—perhaps not his or her public persona butmaybe their private self. Sometimes that’s the case. It’s pretty obvious thatAyn Rand’s Howard Roark is doubtless a manifestation of Rand’s philosophicaloutlook on the body politic, but Nabokov’s Humbert Humbert probably isn’t anexpression of that author’s belief system. In fact, he was fairly adamant inpublic utterances that it wasn’t. That he felt compelled to even address it isproof positive that he acknowledged there were some who felt Humbert was, insome way, Nabokov. Some dark corner of his psyche, perhaps. It’s this kind ofmindset that I think prevents some writers from creating characters like aHumbert Humbert. Most of the folks who come to these kinds of conclusions don’thave a platform other than the washeteria in their trailer parks, but onoccasion opinions like this gain publicity.I’ll face this kind of absurdity myself when mynovella, The Rapist, comes out. The protagonist is a vile man by anyreasonable definition and I think he’s accurately portrayed—there are folks outthere who think and act just as Truman Ferris Pinter does, but he’s not me noreven a small part of me.It seems to me that what’s important about thephilosophy McCarthy gives his character isn’t the religious or political orsocial view it expresses. It seems to me that there’s something deeper going onwith Chigurh and why the author gives him this expression of his take onexistence.In my view, this shows a writer who understands thecriminal mind better than most writers. It’s why I enjoy and respect his booksand especially this one which is an absolute work of genius. He knows how mymind works.Here’s the deal. Many sociologists and other socialscientists and your average citizen down at Starbucks enjoying their soy lattescome up with all kinds of theories as to what creates a criminal. Economicconditions are an oft-cited reason. Poor people commit more crimes becausethey’re… well… poor. Abused people commit crimes because they’re… well… abused.Kids from broken homes commit crimes because they’re… well… you get thepicture. As that sage philosopher Kurt Vonnegut would say, “And so it goes.”Well, they all miss the real reason some of us arecriminals. They all approach criminality via a cause and effect point of view.“Sixty percent of those incarcerated come from poverty.” “Seventy-one pointthree percent of those in prison were abused as children.” And… so it goes.(Thanks for the leit motif, Kurt.)These folks never seem to have a good answer whenskeptics point out that the two brothers and three sisters from the same socialand economic background as the armed robber brother doing ten and a quarterdidn’t end up the same way.These folks are oh-so-close but unfortunatelyunderstanding people accurately isn’t scored like a horseshoe match.There is one thing only that creates a criminal anda criminal mindset.Control.More accurately, the overwhelming sense of a lackof control. Control is often confused with power, but power is simply theactive element of control.As we know from being told in countless articles andlectures in Intro to Soc 101, rape isn’t about sex; it’s about power. Well, yesand no. It’s really about control. Power is just one of the facets of thatcontrol. The rapist is a person who sees himself as being without controlinasfar as the opposite (or even same) sex is concerned. He’s a guy who’stongue-tied around women. A guy whose hands sweat even thinking about holding agirl’s hand or touching her skin. He’s a guy who stands in the corner at anightclub, afraid to approach the women at that table across the way. He’spositive they’re going to laugh at him. He has no control over women. Or, onthe outside he may appear to, but inside he knows he really doesn’t.But… he does. He figures out a way to gain controlof women–or men, sexually–or children, sexually. When he has a knife in hishand or a gun or a terrifying look and voice, or is physically stronger, andthere’s no one around but him and his victim. For a brief period, he’s gainedcontrol.As has the armed robber, the burglar, thepurse-snatcher, the check-kiter, the confidence man or woman, the murderer, thearsonist. All of ‘em. Each crime, each criminal, arrives as a reaction to adeep sense of the lack of control in the miscreant’s life in a particular area.It’s why the siblings of the armed robber doing time aren’t in there with himand have never committed crimes themselves. They don’t feel the same degree oflack of control in their lives. They haven’t reached the place in their ownlives that convince them they have no control.So, yes, in a way, poverty, bad childhoods, and allof those factors help create criminals, by convincing the individual that he orshe lacks significant control over their lives. Most of the time the childmolester was molested himself during childhood. In a graphic andup-close-and-personal way it was brought home to him that he didn’t have anounce of control when Pappy had him down and was drilling him. The only way toregain any sense of control is to control someone else. Briefly, he has controland it’s an exhilarating experience. But, it’s soon over. But, he remembers thefeeling of being in control and so he has to repeat the action to regain thefeeling. It’s why serial killers, serial rapists, serial molesters, careerrobbers and burglars and all the other forms of criminals keep on keeping on.To recapture that feeling of being in control. All other times and events intheir lives simply… what’s the word I want?… oh, yeah… simply suck incomparison.We criminals call it “the high.” It’s better thansex, we say. Better than drugs. Breaking into a bar and walking out with thecontents of the cash register is an indescribable high. You’re king of themountain. You feel just like the politician who just got elected mayor orpresident. Same deal. Why do you think the mayor then wants to be governor andthen president? Same impetus as the guy who snatches purses, then burglarizesbars, then holds up banks. Control furnishes a high but just like any drug theuser requires more and more and in stronger doses.And, McCarthy understands all this. For me, this ishis genius. He doesn’t give us Chigurh’s terrible or happy childhood. Itdoesn’t matter. Chigurh could have been the son of a Fortune 500 CEO or hecould have been raised in a tarpaper shack. Somewhere along the line—no matterwhat his circumstance was—something happened to him that convinced him helacked control over his life or at least a significant part of it. It’s just morelikely to happen in an impoverished circumstance. So, he did what anyhalf-intelligent person does. He regained control. By killing folks. Every timehe stood over someone he’d just rendered room temperature, he got that feelingnot to be had anywhere else… of control. The moment before he killed them wasthe very best part. It’s a place where he knows and his victim knows that he’sin total charge of them. It’s the feeling the ancient kings enjoyed.The high.He (Chihurh) probably even came up with hisphilosophy of order in a chaotic universe with the coin bit. If it hadn’t beenthat, it would have been something else. Probably something like that of Julesin Pulp Fiction just before he kills the frat boy drug dealers. In fact,if Julies did go forth and travel the land as he proclaimed he would, he couldhave become Chigurh. They come from the same place and, not coincidentally, areboth the best examples of the true criminal mind in literature I can think of.What film critic Mark T. Conrad noted about Pulp Fiction—that it wasabout “American nihilism,” could be just as accurately applied to Chigurh’scharacter. It’s a different brand of nihilism than British nihilism but bothare cuttings from the same plant.(Although, one thing disturbs me about Chigurh. Hedoesn’t “feel” like an American. He feels more like a Russian. Maybe it’s hisbad haircut…)Here’s the scene from the movie version:GAS STATION GUY: I didn’t put nothin’ up.ANTON CHIGURH: Yes, you did. You’ve been putting it up your whole life you justdidn’t know it. You know what date is on this coin?GAS STATION GUY: No.ANTON CHIGURH: 1958. It’s been traveling 22 years to get here. And now it’shere. And it’s either heads or tails. And you have to say. Call it.GAS STATION GUY: Look, I need to know what I stand to win.ANTON CHIGURH: Everything.GAS STATION GUY: How’s that?ANTON CHIGURH: You stand to win everything. Call it.It’s the tsunami arriving, courtesy of thatbutterfly flapping its wings weeks before. (In this case, 22 years before.)Only one new element introduced in this scenario. God. Chigurh has insertedhimself into the equation as the Almighty God of this particular universe. Healone can decide if the tsunami is going to happen. If not the God himself, theinstrument of that diety. I imagine others might see him as Satan, but I thinkhe sees himself as the avenging angel of God.He’s in control.In the midst of chaos.And, that’s what I make of Chigurh’s philosophy… Andwhy I think No Country for Old Men is one of the best American novelsever written. This is noir at its gothic best.As a note unrelated to the above, I’ve been curious as to what symbolismcritics give to the captive bolt gun. Personally, I think it’s simply aMacGuffin. I’d love to turn the tables on the interviewer here and ask you,Richard, what do you think it represents?Although, the more I think about it, by employingthe captive bolt gun—which is designed to render livestock killings as more“humane” as it is used to stun the animal before killing to prevent pain andsuffering as they bleed out—that makes Chigurh more the agent of a fierce OldTestament God who only extracts justice, as opposed to Satan who would mostcertainly desire pain and suffering.Howimportant is body language to a criminal and how does it inform your writing?It’s absolutely crucial to survival. Both inside andoutside the walls.Inside, anybody in there can go “off” at any second.If you’re not prepared for that eventuality, you may well end up roomtemperature. I think it’s why a lot of guys who’ve done time are above-averagepoker players. Of course, most guys inside the walls have probably played morepoker than the average straight on the bricks, simply because of ourlifestyles, but you quickly learn to read the “tells” everyone has.On the bricks, it’s easier to spot significant bodylanguage, mostly because more people aren’t aware they’re signaling a potentialaction. Fewer people read body language so when you’re aware someone is, youknow that’s a person to watch. And, on the bricks the observers stand out, muchmore so than in the joint where everybody is watching each other.Staying alive depends a lot on avoiding dangeroussituations. There are dozens and dozens of signals people give off but I’llgive you just a couple. If I’m in a bar, just having a peaceful glass of beer,and a guy walks in and sits a couple of stools away from me and I see he’sordered a beer, I keep an eye on him. I want to see what he does when heempties the bottle. If the barkeep comes over to remove it and the guy grabs itand smiles at him that he wants to keep it, I usually move to a table or atleast farther down the bar. It’s what I do. It’s what most ex-cons do. Thefirst thing we do when we walk into a room is find a weapon. In a bar, theeasiest is to just hang onto that beer bottle. Don’t give it up until it’sreplaced by another. Sometimes, I’ll spot a guy who walks in, sits at the bar,orders a drink and then reaches over and grabs a large ashtray. When he doesn’tbegin to smoke and doesn’t look as if he plans to, I again get up and move.He’s just selected a weapon in case things go hinky. It doesn’t necessarilymean he’s itching to use it, but if someone comes in and starts some shit,he’ll have it ready and probably clip the nearest guy to him with it. It’s justa good idea to remove yourself from the near vicinity of someone who’s made apoint of obtaining a weapon.Even at this far remove from my prison days, Iretain some habits that are so ingrained I doubt that I’ll ever change them.Here are just a few:1. I will rarely, if ever, sit in a public placewith my back exposed. I want to know who enters the space immediately.2. The second thing I do after entering and locatinga potential weapon, is to figure out at least a couple of escape routes shouldthe need arise. Usually, in a restaurant, a table by the kitchen is considereda negative. I see it as a positive, simply because that’s where the nearestback door is.3. When walking down the street I avoid direct eyecontact in a way that’s hard to describe. Looking away is a sign of weakness,while making direct eye contact is a sign of aggressiveness. But, there’s a wayof looking directly at a person that’s neither and doesn’t threaten or signalsubmission. I wish I could explain how to do it, but I can’t. I just know howto do it and most who’ve done time also know how. It’s kind of like whenJustice Potter Stewart was asked to define pornography and he said he couldn’tdefine it, but he knew it when he saw it. I can’t define the technique, but Iknow it when I see it.4. If I see a guy who keeps touching his front pantspocket I assume he’s got a knife or mayb a gun there. If I see him touching hiswallet in his back pocket, I laugh as he’s expecting pickpockets and has read toomany crime novels and his actions are only going to draw a thief as he’s justexposed himself as being perhaps a bit naïve and from a small town. In otherwords, a probably easy mark.5. In a public bathroom that’s unoccupied when Ienter, I always select a urinal on the end and never one in the middle. I’vejust cut down the possibilities in half of someone next to me attacking me. Ifsomeone comes in and there are 4-5 urinals and I’m on one end and he picks theone next to me, I’m going to deliver some fairly overt body language that tellshim to back off. Most likely, I’ll just say something. Before I do, I’llalready have cut the flow and zipped up.The most important body language however, isdelivered via the eyes. You can tell just about everything you need to knowabout someone via the eyes.There’s a look almost all inmates hate to see. Theguy looking at them with bovine eyes. The “look of love.” Once you’ve seen iton a guy, you never forget it. And, you want to go to a planet they’re notcurrently on. It’s a look that makes your blood curdle. The instant you see it,you know there’s going to be blood on the floor. Yours, his, or both of yours.It’s a foregone conclusion almost always.There’s that “comfortable space” thing. I forget thedimensions other than Europeans will allow other folks to get closer to themthan Americans will. In the joint, the allowable space is closer to theAmerican model but further than that allowed in civilian life.There are dozens and dozens of things body languagetells you, if not hundreds. It would take a thick book to list them all andthen I’d miss some.As far as how it informs my writing? I think it hasa huge impact, perhaps not consciously but at least on an experiential level.I’m extremely aware of how characters’ actions not only inform their characterbut also create character arc. I’m currently writing a new writer’s how-to, AFiction Writer’s Workshop at the Bijou, and this is one of the mostimportant subjects I’m exploring. I use the movie Thelma & Louise,and as one example show how the action of smoking works both to establishcharacter as well as show character growth. In the beginning, Louise is smokingand Thelma is nibbling on a candy bar. One is the action of an adult and theother of a child. As the story moves forward, Thelma pantomimes Louise smoking,dragging on an unlit cigarette and obviously mimicking Louise. Eventually,Thelma begins to smoke, but she places the cigarette in the middle of hermouth. Near the end, Thelma has become a chain smoker and the butt hangsloosely from the corner of her mouth.I try to use body language and actions just asCallie Khouri (the screenwriter of T&L) did. For instance, in one ofmy short stories, “Blue Skies,” the protagonist in the turning point suddenlyrealizes his teenaged daughter Celsi is never going to change from thementally-challenged child she was at the age of six, when he sees her bite intoa sandwich from the middle, just as she did when a young child. He realizesadults almost always bite the tip off first and knew from that, that she wasnever going to be any older mentally than she was at the age of six.Body language and actions are extremely powerful,both in real life and in effective fiction.Doyou think killing and fucking are related?No.Okay, I was having fun with that one.There’s a long tradition within civilized history ofthe two being connected. Look at the metaphysical poets like Andrew Marvel andJohn Donne in the 17th century. Writing at that time was restricted to the educatedwhich meant the clergy. And, their output was severely restricted and censored.Bad things—like dismemberment and other nasty things—happened to writers andother thinkers who violated the precepts of the Church. The only problem was,poets then were pretty much like poets now. Mostly what they wanted to writeabout—mostly what they thought was writing about—was sex. Since they werewriters and therefore clever fellows, they wrote about sex.By the only way available. By using coded language.These guys were dripping with testosterone and wrote verse that was basicallyporn. And not just soft porn, but lots of hard-core porn as well. How did theydo that and keep their heads attached?Easy. When they wanted to express the joys of asexual climax, they just used the code. They didn’t say their character was“getting his rocks off” in whatever the popular vernacular of the day was.Nope. They just said he had a “little death.” Everybody was in on it, evenChurch officials. Especially Church officials! Under those robes beat athrobbing… well, you know… Ol’ John might have meant something else by that “noman is an island…” thing.Killing and sex are Siamese twins joined at the hip.It was entirely natural to use death and killing in those codes for sex. Theyknew they were related.Probably three-fourths or more of all murders arelinked to sex in some way. Probably a higher percentage than that. Even themurders ostensibly over money are more often than not about money as a means togain sex. It takes money for a really ugly, really fat, really old guy to getthe kind of sex partner he lusts for. Killing the wife gains not only a lifeinsurance policy, the family business, but at the end of that rainbow, a newer,thinner, less-wrinkled piece of tail.And, it cuts both ways among the sexes. Equalopportunity. Just as many horny women killers as there are male. It takes moneyfor a really ugly, really fat, really old woman to get the kind of sex partnershe lusts for. Killing the husband gains not only a life insurance policy, thefamily business, but at the end of that rainbow, a newer, thinner,less-wrinkled lover. Again, a form of control.The connection between the two goes back muchfurther than history. Prehistory gives us the image of Thog with his club knockingout the woman and dragging her back to the cave by her tresses. What’s missingin that cartoon panel is the start of the story. Thog cracking the woman’s mateover the head first…Early nihilism…Sex is both a need and a desire and the time-honoredand time-proven way to get it is to kill whoever or whatever’s in the way.Whoever being the current sexual partner. Whatever being the capital to securethe sexual partner.This probably isn’t the answer you expected,Richard, but it’s the one I’m giving. Sometimes, we make things morecomplicated that they are, yes?Of course they’re related.Tellus about your novel The Bitch.Aha! This is what we call ”the money shot” in pornmovie parlance…The Bitchis the book I’m the proudest of. Well, co-proudest of… I have a newnovella coming out next year—The Rapist—that I’m equally proud of, butthis question is about The Bitch, so I’ll restrict my remarks to it.It marks a break-through for me from somethinglearned during the writing of it. I’d written several endings to it and whileeach one would have been fine—at least on a commercial level—each left meunsatisfied. First, the protagonist in this book—Jake Mayes—is as close tobeing myself as any character I’ve ever created. He’s not my alter-ego—he’s myego.I kept writing endings that while not “happy”endings, still stayed within that parameter of commercial endings termed“satisfactory” endings. Not the ending I wanted, but the ending I thought thereading public (whoever they are) would accept. You see, I’m like a lot ofother writers—I want to sell books.I also want to have integrity in my writing.Finally, I took the plunge and wrote the ending I felt true to my character andto the story. Figuring I’d just lost either a publisher or the market. It was…dark. And then I sent it out to Brian Lindemuth, the editor/publisher ofSpinetingler Magazine and Snubnose Press for a possible blurb and when I gothis response back, I knew I’d trusted the right instincts. Here’s what Briansaid:“I liked The Bitch so much that I wanted to publishit. But we lost out and Bare Knuckles Press got a hell of a book. The Bitch isa dark crime fiction story that never once pulls a punch or ducks behind somebullshit like ‘happy endings’ or ‘closure’. The Bitch isn’t afraid to stay darkuntil the very end.” — Brian Lindemuth, editor of Snubnose Press andSpinetingler Magazine.It was the last two lines that told me I’d done theright thing in trusting my instincts.This was the first time I knew it was all right toend a novel in a dark place, without the Hollywood happy-sappy ending or, asLindemuth said, with “closure.” (Whatever that is…)To those more learned than I am, it’s no doubt oldnews that one could write an ending like this and get published. I didn’t knowit was possible. The feeling I got when I learned this was the same as when Idiscovered writers like Charles Bukowski and Brian Everson and realized I couldwrite about the kinds of people that populated my own life. I wasoverwhelmingly naïve about what was possible in fiction. This was enormouslyliberating and it was a release from what I assumed were the limits ofpublishable fiction that allowed me to pull out a manuscript I’d written 20years before and send it out. I’m referring to a novella titled The Rapistthat’s coming out next year from New Pulp Press. I’d written it for myself andnot for publication, believing it wasn’t at all publishable and with theresponse to The Bitch realized that it might be. It was the book Iwished someone else had written and they hadn’t so I had to write it myself…and I did. Thinking that it would forever only be read by myself and maybe acarefully-considered friend or two that I trusted.That first friend was Cortright McMeel. Cortinstantly called it a work of genius and the best thing he’d ever read. Theopinion of someone I respected so very much, coupled with Brian Lindemuth’swords about The Bitch, have changed my entire writing life. Now, I knowanything is possible and that’s incredibly liberating.The Bitchis about Jake Mayes, a guy who’s done two bits in the joint and has been out onthe bricks for a few years now and for all intents and purposes has become aregular citizen. He’s married a wonderful young woman, they’re expecting theirfirst child, and he’s about to open his own business. And then… His formercellmate, Walker “Spitball” Joy calls him out of the blue to demand a favor ofhim. A favor he feels duty-bound to honor as Spitball saved his life one timeback in the joint. The favor centers around Jake’s former specialty, burglary.He was the best in the business. He wants nothing to do with Spitball. Hislife’s on track and his situation is a dangerous one. If he gets caught, hefaces the “three-strikes-and-you’re-out” ha-bitch-ual criminal statute”(hence, the title “The Bitch, which is what cons refer to this law as), andwill end up doing life in the joint.It’s a story that was birthed by my own prisonexperiences and even present life. As Jake faces events transpire that plungehim further and further into the abyss, he makes the same kind of choices I’dmake in the same situations. Choices that might not play down at the FirstBaptist or on Main Street, but that I’d make under the same circumstances.Writing this novel felt more like writing a memoirthan it did fiction. It’s very up close and personal. If I’d had a cellmatelike Spitball to whom I owed a favor I couldn’t refuse, my own life might wellhave turned out the same as Jake’s does. Actually, I do have a former cellmateto whom I owe such a favor. So far, he hasn’t turned up demanding I repay him.If he does, my publisher may want to repackage this as autobiography…It’s difficult to talk about this novel in terms ofplot as it’s nearly impossible to do so without revealing spoilers. What hasbeen extremely gratifying about it is the fantastic blurbs and reviews it’sreceived from writers I have the utmost respect for. I’m very proud it won thePreditors & Editors award for Best Novel for 2011, even though it wasn’treleased until the middle of December and all of the other nominees had amany-months’ head start on it for votes. I’m extremely stoked over the factthat it has been awarded a nomination for Best Novel in the Legends category bythe prestigious Spinetingler Magazine. As it’s only available at presentin ebook format and therefore not eligible for the Edgar awards, this is myown, personal “Edgar” nomination.Towhat extent do you think Jung’s notion of the shadow criminalises some peopleand alienates others?You ask the toughest (and best) questions I’ve everbeen asked in an interview, Richard. I feel like I’m preparing for my orals…Remember, I’m just an ex-con who spent much of my time lying on my bunk in mycell, giving my toes names and teaching my trouser worm to sit up and dotricks…Okay. You just happened to pick the one guy I thinkknew something about the human psyche more than just about anyone else… I’ll domy best here.From my (very!) rudimentary awareness of Jung’sshadow theory, it represented kind of the negative part of Freud’ssubconscious, which makes it the interesting part…And, it was more prominent during the individual’schildhood; as the person grew older, the conscious more and more suppressed it.That kind of makes it where truth resides in my personal interpretation. It’sgoverned more by instinct or race memory than the “logic” gained through“education” or “socialization/acculturization.”My problem with this question is that I don’tsubscribe to the same general definitions of criminality as most appear to.What is termed a “crime” and a “criminal” seem to be artificially-imposed uponthe particular culture or society an individual finds himself in. What’s acrime in one society is deemed an activity to be lauded in another or totallyignored by yet another. Also, I have another problem with the shadow and animusin that they were assigned moral values by Jung as well as his followers and Ithink that by giving it weight in that fashion if it exists, then it’s beencorrupted by the morality component of the definition.My feeling is that once you introduce morality into the equation, it becomesjust another brick in the myth of deity governing man.So, I don’t think it criminalizes or alienatesanyone except in the minds of those who subscribe to notions of morality.For instance, if the “authorities” in a Westernculture were to come upon a woman performing fellatio on her infant son or evenher infant nephew or just a random baby, she would undoubtedly be punished forwhat would be deemed a transgression. However, a like woman in one of severalAmerican Indian cultures of say two hundred years ago, performing the same act,might easily be honored for the same deed. Why? Well, because this was one ofthe evasive tactics when warriors from another tribe were near and the at-risktribe would be killed if detected and it was the custom for a woman (or even aman) to suck on a baby’s penis to keep him quiet and avoid detection.One arguing that it’s the intent that separates oneact from another, similar act, but isn’t that always the standard? And, if so,how can one determine what is in the heart of another?I just can’t subscribe to a moral view of nearlyanything. I always view morality as a contrived set of rules or beliefs thatshift vast degrees, depending on the culture or society and only useful for theruling class to maintain control. And, the older the culture, the more twistedand tortured that moral code becomes as it’s cannibalized and perverted overtime by particular interests who hold sway at various periods.Each side of a debate claims morality as hisauthority. If this is so—and it is—who determines which is the true moralperson? The answer is simple. The one who wins the battle. That’s what italways and ultimately comes down to.One person’s “crime” in one culture is anotherperson’s laudable deed in another. The criminal only exists when his acts arejudged according to an artificial code. A code which is often illogical.What is the difference in the druglord who sends hisminions to kill the opposition’s men who are taking over his drug trade in aparticular neighborhood, from the king or president who sends his minions tokill the opposition’s soldiers who are taking over his land in a particularlocale, from a religious leader who sends his minions to kill the opposition’smen who are trying to supplant his brand of religion with another? I don’t seeany difference. In the end it’s always about control of another and the“morality” is determined by the winner in each case.With all due respect, I think the question is wronghere. Wrong for me. I don’t operate my life by a moral code as much as I do byan expediency set of values. If I commit what society deems to be a crime and Idon’t suffer consequences, then I’ve done nothing wrong in my universe—in fact,“wrong” isn’t an accurate word. Right and wrong don’t exist as far as I’mconcerned, at least not in the same manner of definition as would be deferredto by most others.Jung’s shadow made sense until he began explainingthat it was the irrational side of man. I propose it’s the opposite. I do agreewith him that it represents the creative side of man.Which accounts for the lack of true creativity inmany. It seems to be civilization’s goal to sublimate the shadow side of man.Which may be why they call it the “dark” side.Whatare you working on now?Lots and lots of things! I’m blessed with being ADD,which is a beautiful thing to be if you’re a writer. I’m able tocompartmentalize well and focus narrowly and intensely, and I use it to myadvantage. I keep an average of about 20-25 writing projects going at a time.That includes a wide range of activities, including novels, nonfiction books,articles, letters, blog posts, research, reading and a variety of other writingthings going on at once. It means I don’t waste much time and get a lot doneeach day. What happens is if I get tired (I won’t say “suffer writer’s block”as I don’t believe that exists) of a particular project—say a novel I’m workingon—I simply pull up another file—say another novel I’m writing—and continue onwith it.At present, I’m working on a new thriller I’vetitled THE FIXER, about a hitman from New Orleans who hires out forassassinations but with a twist—all of his hits are made to look likeaccidents. For instance, he’s in the process now of killing a Vermont woman forher husband so the hubby can gain her family fortune, and the method he’schosen is to give her rabies. Her husband invites him to their home for dinnerunder the pretext that he’s a business associate and during the meal, TheFixer, aka Francois Roberge, Jr., born in Opelousas, Louisiana, drugs the wifeand while she’s sleeping, inserts her with live rabies. The beauty of rabies isthat when a person learns they’re infected with the disease… it’s too late formuch of anything other than scribbling out a will… I’m having a lot of funwriting this one as I’ve accumulated a lot of “perfect crimes” that I get touse here. What’s going to be really neat is that Francois is never going to getcaught.I’m also writing another novel that’s along thelines of my forthcoming noir novella, THE RAPIST, and which I won’t talk aboutas it’s still in the evolving stages when too much said about it kind of takesmy edge off when I really need it.I’m writing a new writer’s how-to craft book, titledA FICTION WRITER’S WORKSHOP AT THE BIJOU, that I’ve been working on for severalyears. Had the proposal sold twice and an advance of $10,000 offered and eachtime pulled it back as the publisher wanted things in it I didn’t. I think I’llend up self-publishing it instead and that way I know it’ll be what I want andI won’t have to do some of the things the publisher wanted me to do with it.For instance, include “exercises.” I frickin’ hate exercises. I frickin’ don’tthink they do much at all except look cute and eat up time for writingteachers. So, my version won’t have any frickin’ exercises. Be ye soforewarned. Did I mention I frickin’ hate writing exercises?Hate ‘em enough to give up a sure 10K… I’m kind ofan idiot, aren’t I…I’m doing final rewrites on several books thatshould come out in the near future. I have a YA I’m working on, titled MIRROR,MIRROR for StoneGate Press which I’m told will come out soon. Working onlast-minute changes to a black comedy novel, titled THE GENUINE, IMITATION,PLASTIC KIDNAPPING about a couple of low-lifes who are in debt to the ItalianMafia and work out a plan to end their indebtedness by kidnapping the head ofthe Cajun Mafia and amputating his hand and holding that appendage for ransom.And writing a follow-up novel to it.Working on my memoir, ADRENALINE JUNKIE. And,figuring out how to get a fake passport and new I.D. for when it comes out as Iname names…Have a couple more novels and nonfiction books I’mworking on. Plus, teaching a private online novel-writing class, and teaching aclass via Skype with author Jenny Milchman for the New York Writer’s Workshop.Coaching a few individuals privately on their novels. Getting ready to teachvideo classes for a new venture Kristen Lamb is creating.Doing pub work for FINDING YOUR VOICE. This was myfirst craft book, published by Writer’s Digest Books in hard- and softcover,and my agent, Chip Macgregor secured the ebook rights to it and we publishedthat version ourselves. Trying to get the word out that it’s available.Reading. I average about 3-4 novels a week andconsider it the most important part of writing other than the actual writing Ido myself. It’s how we learn first to be writers and then how to keep improvingour craft. As it so happens, one of the novels I’m reading at the moment isyour own MR. GLAMOUR.Doing this interview! This has been the mostexhaustive interview I’ve ever been involved with. It’s really made me think.After we’re done here, Richard, I just want to go away with a bottle of Jackand find a deserted beach somewhere and just get blotto for a week… What thisreminds me of are the Paris Review interviews, only I think yours areeven more personalized and more in-depth (read: intense) and those arepretty good interviews—really the best in the business, I thought, until I metyou!Howmuch pleasure is derived from fucking during a porn film with a camera crewfilming you and what did those experiences tell you about the average sex lifeand the prevalence of voyeurism in modern culture?I imagine you’re talking about the stag movies Imade when I was in Bermuda at the tender age of 20, right? That’s how long agoit was—the term “porn” wasn’t even around then. They were just… stag movies.What happened was a friend of mine and I werewalking down a beach in Bermuda on our usual quest—to pick up girls. We had alittle “routine” we used all the time. He carried a camera—that didn’t evenhave film in it—and I carried a notepad and pen. We’d walk the beach until wespotted a pair of girls we deemed attractive and then “Mike” (not his realname) would begin walking around them, snapping pictures. I’d start jotting thingsdown in my pad. One of the girls would ask what we were doing and we’d explainthat we were doing a feature for Life Magazine on the “College Week”phenomenon in Bermuda. That they might well make the cover! It was a con thatworked often and well. Almost always we ended up with the girls.Well, this day a guy was watching us and laughing tohimself—we weren’t too hard to figure out—and he approached us to ask if we’dbe interested in making a movie. A sex movie.Of course we were! We were 20 years old and fancied ourselves as studs to beginwith so he didn’t have to sell his proposition very hard.The upshot was, we ended up making a movie thatturned out to not have much of a plot. Two girls in nurses’ uniforms walk intoour “doctor’s office” and pretty soon shucked their dress whites and we got ridof our stethoscopes and were soon doing the horizontal boogie on a couple ofexamination tables. Fairly low-rent production.When we finished the “film” the guy in charge gaveMike a hundred-dollar bill, and thanked him, and asked me to stick around. Mikeleft and the guy asked if I’d be interested in making more movies. Of course Iwould! I ended up making two more “movies” that day and made a couple hundredmore dollars. He asked me to come back the next day and I said I would, butsomething or other came up—a party probably—and I never went back.That wasn’t the end of it though. Years later, I wasback in Indiana and getting ready to get married. A friend hosted a bachelor’sparty for me and somebody brought stag movies. I never watch those things—mostare boring—and, in fact, was engrossed in playing in the poker game we hadgoing, my back to the screen, when somebody yelled out, “That’s Les!”I turned around and sure enough… it was moi. In one of those godawful stagmovies I’d “starred” in. As I was striving to keep my past hidden in those days(I’d already done time in Pendleton at the time), I managed to convinceeverybody it wasn’t me. It was a fairly grainy copy so it wasn’t all that hard.It could have been embarrassing if my fiancée had discovered my acting days…As to your question, I’m not sure if I can provide agood answer. Screwing in front of a camera just wasn’t a big deal at that time.Before that time, I’d logged in many hours in another establishment in Bermudathat was far more risque. A guy owned a huge loft downtown that consisted ofdozens of mattresses laid end-to-end and covering the entire floor and therewere large movie screens on three walls. On which were being shown porn movies continually.To get into the loft you simply paid five dollars a person. It was a “date”scene. At any time, there would be up to 20-30 people and occasionally more—menand women, men and men, women and women—you name the combination, they werethere—all doing the nasty on the mattresses while the movies played. We used totake the little college coeds visiting the island there and they were thrilledto experience the seedier side of life. It’s amazing what girls will do whenthey get away from home and no one knows them… Mostly girls from Vassar andBennington and the like… So screwing before a camera just wasn’t a big deal. Idon’t remember thinking much about it. If I’d been in the States and neverventured anywhere else it might have been, but fucking in front of the camerajust didn’t represent much of a wow factor.And, when you say “modern culture” my observation isthat we did a lot more risqué things then than folks do today. By the time Iwas twenty, I’d been to bed with more than a hundred women and with the adventof all the STD’s today, I’d be an anomaly today I suspect. Then, I was just anormal young male. The culture today seems much more Puritanical, although theyounger generation would want to argue about that I imagine, taking for grantedthat they’re freer sexually. Not so, my young grasshoppers…Today’s kids talk a good game. I’m not sure theyplay as hard as we did…GrahamGreene said writers have a piece of ice in their hearts. What do you make ofhis observation?Many writers do. I do. I’m not sure if those whowrite for publications such as Guideposts do. My instincts say they donot. Like a lot of sayings like this, often they could be made clearer withqualifiers. In this case, perhaps what he said could be improved by saying, “Goodwriters have a piece of ice in their hearts.”Before I was aware of Greene’s observation, I’d cometo the same conclusion myself. I think that nearly all writers of real abilitydo the same. Often, I would tell students that “if you want to write, youshould write every day. For instance, I love my mother (this was before I foundout my mother was a lying bitch–another story) and if she died tomorrow, I’d bevery sad and go to the funeral. But, when I returned home, I’d write. Probablyabout the funeral.”That’s what Greene is referring to. The art ofdetachment from the emotional to be able to observe an event and describe itaccurately and dispassionately. It’s what allows us to write dramaticallyinstead of melodramatically. It is simply the ability to maintain alertness andkeep your own emotions at bay when describing events, especially events thatcarry emotion personally. It’s not “coldness” or “calculating observation” assome would say. It’s simply maintaining the reporter’s stance when writingdrama so as to maintain the drama and not tip over into melodrama.The writer who creates the scene with the youngmother walking down the street with her beloved toddler, hand-in-hand, laughingat the child’s antics, and then abruptly, the little girl tears her hand awayfrom her mother’s, darts into the street and is struck by a van and instantlykilled in a particularly bloody manner, attendant with gore and bits of thechild’s brains spattered against the vehicle’s bumper—the writer who writessuch a scene and portrays the mother as then running into the street, screamingat the top of her lungs, cursing God as she shakes her fist at the heavens, andthen prostrating herself across the dead body of her baby, wailing and moaningand screaming by turn, tearing out handfuls of her hair—that writer is one whoisn’t aware of Greene’s description of a (good) writer. However, the same scenerendered by one who has a character facing the same scene—the mother—and hasthat woman simply slump to the curb, eyes dry, and instead given that“thousand-yard stare” that soldiers in combat have—this is a writer who hasthat piece of ice in his heart. Two writers—one who sees and writes about whatthey see in melodramatic terms—and one who sees and writes about what they seein dramatic terms.Having that piece of ice in our hearts is whatallows the good writer to lower the volume instead of raising it. Therebycreating true emotion and not surface emotion, cheaply and easily wrought.That first writer is who Oscar Wilde was referringto in his famous criticism of that most melodramatic writer of all time,Charles Dickens, when he said, “One must have a heart of stone to read thedeath of little Nell without laughing.”Indeed.To be fair, there is another point of viewconcerning Greene’s statement. His own cousin, Barbara Greene, said of himthat: “…most of humanity was to him like a heap of insects that he liked toexamine, as a scientist might examine his specimens, coldly and clearly.”So, you have that, too…I suspect Babs enjoyed Dickens’ books more than shedid her cousin’s…Why we have readers of romance novels and readers ofnoir…Just sayin’…Doyou think Faulkner merged Noir with Southern Gothic and that the history of theSouth provides a rich soil for Noir fiction?Absolutely, on both! My personal opinion is that thebest U.S. writers in any genre come from the South. It’s because of severalfactors. One of the biggest is that language is more important to Southernersthan for those of other regions. It’s a class-conscious society to the nthdegree and what you say, the words you choose, and how you say it tell a nativeexactly who you are, where you came from, and what your status is. And statusis important to Southerners. It’s all about family. Unlike Yankees, money isn’tthe determining factor in your status. It’s family. Old money is good; newmoney is suspect and not well-regarded. Those folks are better regarded intowns like Miami and Dallas which are two towns that aren’t considered all thatsouthern by the surrounding natives. Too many carpetbaggers. Atlanta’s gettingthere if they’re not there already… Houston for sure.For instance, I’ve lived in New Orleans for much ofmy life, and I can easily identify nine different accents from different partsof town. An Uptown accent is much different than one from the Irish Channel asis a Downtown accent much different than one from the Ninth Ward. And so on. IfI hear a teenaged girl say “Jeezum” I know almost to the block where she’s from.And, where a person is from is important to most natives. We live in a classsociety in the South and what class you belong to impacts the way you’ll betreated by others. It determines how you think of yourself.I consider myself a Southerner even though thesedays I find myself in Indiana. Most of my stories are set in the south. I’vewritten a few set in the north, but I’m always uncomfortable. It feels like I’mwriting about a foreign country. The north “feels” sterile to me. Familydoesn’t seem to matter—the history of families doesn’t seem to matter. Theclass lines are blurred and seem to focus more on wealth than anything else.The north feels like TV; the south feels like movies. F. Scott Fitzgerald’snovels feel like soap operas—TV—James Lee Burke’s novels feel like movies.Here’s a real-life anecdote that somewhatillustrates the differences. My wife Mary is a born and bred Yankee, havingbeen born in New Hampshire and living most of her life in Ft. Wayne, Indiana.Before we got married, I told her there was no way I could live in Ft. Wayne,and she was happy to move with me back to New Orleans. At the time, we wereboth hairstylists. She found a job in a salon a block from our home on Burthe(pronounced “Butte”) on Carrollton where it ends at the levee and takes a turnonto St. Charles Avenue. Across the street from the little strip mall where theCamillia Grill is. I worked uptown at a salon in the Fairmont Hotel, “Busta’sat the Fairmont.”One day, shortly after we’d moved to New Orleans,Mary and I were walking from our house to the Camillia Grill for breakfast andI saw this young lady with a young man. In passing the couple, I overheard hersay something to her escort. Without thinking, I pointed her out and said,“Looks like she’s trying to pass.” Being from the north, Mary didn’t have aclue what I was talking about, so I had to explain.“That girl’s black,” I said. “She’s trying to passfor white.” She was with a young white guy which is why I made the assumption.To me it was obvious for a couple of reasons. One, the couple went intoMadigan’s which was a neighborhood bar and not a bar a black person wouldordinarily go into. Also, when she spoke to her companion, her syntax told meshe was black. I wish I could remember what it was she said, but at this lateremove I can’t. All I remember was it told me she was from the Ninth Ward.Mary looked at me like she thought I was nuts, andsaid, “You’re crazy! That girl’s whiter than I am!” Well, her skin color wasbut she had other features that told me she had some black blood in her, plusher language. I didn’t pursue it or try to convince her otherwise and I thoughtthat was the end of it.Until the following day. When Mary came home fromwork the first thing she did was tell me about an incident at work. Seems thatthe same girl we’d seen the day before was a client of one of the otherstylists at her salon and came in for her appointment. Another of Mary’sco-workers, a black lady who was one of the shampoo assistants, walked by Maryand whispered to her, “That hussy! She’s passin’!” Mary said she went into mildshock and told the girl that’s what I’d said when I saw her, to which the girljust shook her head as if amazed that Mary couldn’t see what was obvious toboth her and me.The point of this little anecdote isn’t to show thatracism is alive and strong—of course it is—but to show the difference betweenthe north and the south. Both a southern white man and a southern black womanwere instantly aware that a black woman was trying to pass as white. And, it matteredto them, at least enough to comment on it. The Yankee (Mary) didn’t “see” whatwe saw and even when it was pointed out to her, she just didn’t see why itmattered. That’s because she doesn’t share a history. She’s not even aware of ahistory. I also know that if this was in the north—say in Cleveland or inBridgeport—and that same woman had walked by, a northern black very likelywould have taken her appearance, speech and circumstance in and come to thesame conclusion—that she was passing. The northern white person wouldn’t have.Blacks and whites are intertwined with their jointhistories in the South in ways that doesn’t occur anywhere else. It’s a bloody,violent history and renders the perfect tableau for noir and gothic, more sothan any other region. It’s simply a dark, twisted history. Fertile loam forstory to grow in. The climate also contributes. As Ellen Gilchrist said, tosurvive in New Orleans “requires equal amounts of sugar and alcohol.” Thatisn’t something that would hold water if she were talking about say, Des Moinesor Santa Barbara or Albany… It would apply to Biloxi, Houma, or myhometown, Freeport, Texas.It’s thousands of seemingly little things like thisthat make language extremely important to Southerners. There’s a rigid classsystem at work and it’s why that young woman was trying to pass. If she couldbe taken as white, at least in her mind, she would have improved her station inlife. It doesn’t matter that some people think that’s a bunch of hooey or not—itexists and that’s what’s important.Faulkner, as a native Southerner, was also wellaware of it and wrote from that place. It’s why his fiction resonates with somany. Even readers from other sections of the country and other countries canjust “sense” that history bubbling beneath the surface. A dark history, notavailable in most other places, at least not over a significant period of time.You can’t fake that. It lends his writing a verisimilitude that has to beearned by coming from a particular place. It’s the same kind of thing thathappens when I read criminal characters from writers who have never beencriminals nor have ever done time. The verisimilitude isn’t there. There’s noexperiential “heart” to the writing. A TV show, not a movie.Language is all. It’s why overall, the Irish are thebest writers and the American Southerner the second best. Which makes me wonderif there isn’t another relationship going on—after all, the American South waspopulated originally mostly by the Scotch-Irish…In my opinion…(I expect other opinions will surface… most likelyfrom those not Irish or Southerners…)Thank you for this opportunity, Richard. This hasbeen the single toughest interview experience I’ve ever had!Thankyou Les for a great and heavyweight interview.Links:Author websiteThe Bitch atAmazon US or UK.Just Like Thatat Amazon US or UK.All Les Edgerton works listed on Amazon US and UK.This entry was posted in Author Interviews - Chin Wags.

Leshas a great understanding of people and writing, which he is why he is one ofthe best storytellers around. Great questions. Great answers.Reply  K. A.     Laity says: June 20, 2012 at 7:14 pm Another excellent interview,Les and Richard: a good subject drawn out by a dogged host. Insightful views onthe genre, Faulkner and McCarthy. I do chafe a little at the characterisationof the 17th century. You can’t get much more explicit than Donne’s Elegy “To His Mistress Going to Bed” where he cheekilysays “To teach thee, I am naked first.” A quibble, no more. And after thePuritans take over — well, no one has any fun.Reply  Les Edgerton says: June 20, 2012 at 7:24 pm I have been waiting for thisinterview to appear. It is without any doubt, the most intensive questioningI’ve ever undergone and it was exhausting. Richard Godwin is the most superbinterviewer I’ve ever been honored to have participated in such a venture with.As I told him, this “felt” like one of those Paris Review experiences. I’m veryproud of it and of anything I’ve ever taken part in, would be pleased to havethis as my epitaph on what I feel about the art of writing..If folks like this, it’s allbecause of the genius of Mr. Godwin. He is, simply, the best.Thank you for having me. I’mhumbled and honored.Blue skies,LesReply  B.R. Stateham says: June 20, 2012 at 7:27 pm Les is a talkativesonofabitch (that’s a compliment, by the way). But for anyone thinking aboutbecoming a writer they ought to carefully read and reread this one.Thought-provoking doesn’t come close to describing what’s going through my mindnow! Great stuff! Great Questions! Great Answers!Reply  Jason Michel says: June 20, 2012 at 7:44 pm Goodness!I’m speechless. Fantastic gents …Reply  Chris Rhatigan says: June 20, 2012 at 8:38 pm “Noir approaches the truenihilistic nature of man better than most genres. Which means it will nevertake up a lot of shelf space at Barnes & Noble.”Yes!Reply  nigel     bird says: June 20, 2012 at 8:55 pm Was that an interview? I wasmaking mental notes of quotes I wanted to flag, but then lost them as therewere so many.Just a con? Don’t think so,Les. You’re not ‘just’ anything.Interesting answers all, someof which passed over my head. I’ll come back and take them one at a timeanother day.Thanks both.Reply  Thomas     Pluck says: June 20, 2012 at 9:16 pm Fine interview, as always,Richard! And Les always has something interesting to say. A great read.Reply  Heath Lowrance says: June 20, 2012 at 10:18 pm Best. Interview. Ever.Reply  Jenny Milchman     says: June 20, 2012 at 11:53 pm Richard does make one think,and Les is the perfect thinker to be prodded! OK, first I have to say, read THEBITCH. It’s true it’s not a daydream book (which I happen to love). It’s trueit won’t restore order to anyone’s disordered world. But it, like Richard’sinterviews, will make you think and feel and despair. And that’s what greatfiction does.I’m also wondering what itsays about me that despite never having been inside, I follow almost all ofLes’ safety tips except for the one at the urinal?Reply  Les Edgerton says: June 21, 2012 at 12:31 am Thanks, everyone! Goodpoint, K.A. He did write some “out front” verse, didn’t he! I like his “coded”stuff maybe better–makes one feel good and dirty… Donne’s my favorite poet andI almost decided to get a doctorate on the metaphysicists–particularly Donne(not nearly as big a fan of Marvell’s), but went for the MFA instead. Shouldhave followed my instincts… Just nice to see a fellow “fan”…Reply  Catie     Rhodes says: June 21, 2012 at 1:35 am I loved reading thisinterview. Les, you are one of the most fascinating individuals I’ve comeacross. I could “listen” to your stories forever. Loved reading your insightshere both on human nature and on fiction. I learned a lot. Keep on rockin’,Les.Reply  Allan     Leverone says: June 21, 2012 at 2:03 am Maybe the best interview ofan author I’ve ever read. I did exactly the same thing as Nigel, noting quotesI wanted to remember, but had to give up because there were so many. Great jobon both ends of this interview…Reply  Rick     Bylina says: June 21, 2012 at 2:38 am Great interview, Les andRichard. I wouldn’t survive five minutes in the state pen. Might get by in afederal prison, as long as I was isolated 24 hours a day. So much to mull overhere, my head hurts. But that’s good for a mystery writer. Now, if I could onlyfind the plot I left lying on the floor.Reply  Scott Phillips says: June 21, 2012 at 4:47 am Great interview….just gotstarted reading Les’s stuff, and am completely blown away by it.Reply  Aimee     L. Salter says: June 21, 2012 at 5:28 am A fabulous interview! But,Les, I have to disagree: A good interview requires not only a person who knowswhat questions to ask, but another who’s willing to actually answer them. It’swhy most interviews in any format these days are such utter tripe. Peopletelling you what they think you want to hear – or what they want you to hear –rather than the truth.So, well done to both ofyou. I’m pointing people here for an ACTUAL study in writing andcharacterization.Reply  Tracey Edges says: June 21, 2012 at 3:28 pm Excellent – don’t need tosay anything more as it would be superfluous.Reply  AJ Hayes says: June 23, 2012 at 2:18 am Thanks for the hat tip to“Southerners and Irishmen,” Les. I could not agree more. Probably doesn’tmatter that I’m both of those oh-so-desirable states of being, does it? Of coursenot. Many thanks to the both of you for this massive effort, both ways. Remindsme of Proust, sort of. I mean it’s got the physical dimensions and duration of“Remembrence” and, like that tome, contains some of the most clear edged,diamond bright images and opinions I’ve seen.Are criminals smart? Define smart. (Never really met a criminal genius, myself.But that probably means the crook I don’t know about is a genius.) Ah, just toomuch meat here to reiterate (requrgitate?) in a comment.Have known and worked with many guys fresh out of the joint. In my last job(twenty years worth of job) probably every eight guys out of ten we hired werein a halfway house, so I can tell when somebody is bullshitting about “heavytime.” No BS in the above, none at all. It’s absolute truth. I got stories,good, bad and heartbreaking about those guys.Thanks Les and Richard. Another superior outing in the SlaughterhouseReply  richardgodwin says: June 23, 2012 at 7:41 pm Les thank you for a classicand brilliant interview.Reply  Jenny Hansen says: June 24, 2012 at 7:18 am This interview was so goodand so full of information, I’ve had to read it a little sip at a time. ThoughLes is definitely a shot of good tequila, rather than some snooty French wine(thank the Lord). This is an interview to berevisited multiple times, and savored. I appreciate the time and effort thatBOTH of you put into this.Reply  Vero says: July 1, 2012 at 10:45 am One of the best interviewsI’ve ever read, and certainly one of the sharpest writers and best writingteachers I’ve ever met—thank you, Les!Reply  Eddie     Vega says: July 25, 2012 at 4:38 pm This is the kind ofinterview you want to print out and include in a course packet for a collegewriting class.Reply  Lee     Thompson says: October 5, 2012 at 9:49 am Great interview, fellas!One of the letters here means something extra to me. It's the one from A.J. Hayes, a much-respected writer who has sadly passed on a couple of years ago. To get the approval of a writer and thinker such as he was means the world to me. As do the comments of everyone else, among them some of the best writers in the business. Thank you each and every one!Blue skies,LesP.S.

{"title": "NEW PODCAST -- LES AND JACK ON WRITING--UNCENSORED", "date": "Sunday, May 21, 2023", "text": "Hi folks, I’ve teamed up with fellow writerJack Holland and we’ve created a podcast on writing I hope you’ll tune into andgive a listen. It’s called “Les and Jack on Writing.” (Catchy title, eh?) Here’s the setup: Jack is a studentin my online writing class, “Les Edgerton’s Bootcamp for Writers.” For the past29 years, Jack has worked as a screenwriter and playwright in L.A. Last year hedecided to write his first novel and joined my class. While possessing a vastknowledge in the film business, he found out quickly that writing fiction is amuch different enterprise. He moved to Ft. Wayne for two reasons. His lovelywife Kim is from here originally and contacted some health problems thatnecessitated leaving California and he had two options—his home in NYC andKim’s home in Ft. Wayne. The deciding factor, he told me was that he’d beenreading my craft book HOOKED for several years and discovered this was where Ilived so they decided to become Hoosiers so he could study directly with me andKim could be close to her own family. Very flattering! This week will be histhird session with the class and he’s come a long, long way! We decided to come up with adifferent format for the podcast. What we’re doing is chatting as friend tofriend and as student to mentor and work each week on his novel. Already, Jackhas made several dramatic breakthroughs and his novel improves by leaps andbounds each week. We’re both very excited about the direction it’s taking. And,we both immediately saw the value our conversations could have for otherwriters, both those relatively newcomers to writing fiction as well as seasonedprofessionals. Also, because of Jack’s background in the movie and theatrebusiness, each week I learn a lot about how that business works and others willfind his insights both entertaining and valuable. In short, we feel we’re creating aproduct that will prove valuable to both tyros and seasoned vets. We’ve alreadypicked up some listeners and subscribers whose names many of you willrecognize. From time to time, we plan to havefolks from both the current class as well as former members joining in ourconversations. As more than three dozen past attendees have published theirnovels written in class—in several cases, multiple novels—you’ll be treated tosome downright talented folks. It is with great expectations wewelcome you to tune in and also contribute in the comments each week. It willsometimes get raucous—our class is called a “bootcamp” for a reason. We simplytell it like it is and strive to always be honest and at times that hurtspeople’s feelings. Sorry… but not sorry. If a teacher isn’t honest inevaluating a writer’s work, it’s the cruelest thing he can do. We tell folks what’swrong but we also tell them why and how to fix it. There’s a lot of pure-dbullshit floating around out there… We aim to keep the smell down…Hope we see you! Places to hear Jack’s and mypodcast. https://www.iheart.com/podcast/338-les-and-jack-on-writing-un-114254064/ https://music.amazon.com/podcasts/843db388-51cd-4a2a-b1d0-de9efa0b094a/les-and-jack-on-writing---uncensored https://lesandjack.podbean.com/ We’ve got about half a dozen shows out there and aimto post at least one new one per week.Blue skies,Les and Jack"},

Here's what Ken had to say after watching us work for the past couple of months:Hi Les,Thank you for the way you handle critiques in your bootcamp. I love that you’re blunt and direct, and don’t feel the need to give participants a handjob for work that misses the mark. I won’t change my tune when it’s my butt in the hot seat. Yep, honest criticism is painful at the time, but it’s a heckuva lot better than thinking you’ve written a literary masterpiece, then learning the brutal truth when nobody will publish it. Maybe I successfully publish, maybe I don’t. I’m convinced I’m in the right place to maximize my chances. And that’s worth the price of admission.Thank you, Les!Best,Ken SpeegleWe'll be starting a new 10-week session in three weeks and it looks like we may have a couple of openings.

Over time the genre has evolved, adapting to the various social and technological transformations of the short century and the first twenty years of the new millennium by changing the settings and psychologies of the characters. There are many masterpieces of this literary genre, the first two that come to mind are Salinger's Young Holden and Someday this pain will be useful to you, by Cameron, and this novel too, while not reaching such high peaks, is an excellent example of it.ROBERT STURMPULP - books dailyPULP - books dailyREVIEWSLes Edgerton / An American history of violence and fishingLes Edgerson, The Death of the Silver King , tr. Marco Piva, Elliott , pp. 224, 17.50 euros printedROBERT STURMDECEMBER 27, 2022Corey John returns to the town where he grew up thirty years after leaving it, in 1955. His family (only his sister is still alive) emigrates to Texas from Indiana where his maternal grandparents live. The father, Robert, begins working for the grandmother, Lucille, who runs a restaurant bar and various other businesses. He almost immediately regrets having moved - Lucille's promise to make him a partner is rejected -, the dream of becoming an airline pilot turns into an obsession and suddenly becomes violent with Corey, giving improbable excuses to punish him violently. Her mother is incapable of reacting and she seeks solace in religion by reading the Bible and attending a community of fanatical believers: she distances herself from her husband and withdraws more and more into herself. The teenager has a friend, Destin, with whom he shares the experience of domestic violence and spends much of his time dreaming of fishing trips with his father, an occasion that for one reason or another almost never materialises. The boy's lifeline is his grandfather, Toast, who introduced him to reading. “It was he who gave me my first book by Mark Twain, and with it also novels by Dos Passos, by Steinbeck, even by Kafka and Camus. […] I was probably the only fourteen-year-old in town who read Céline, and only because I was lucky enough to have a grandfather who was passionate about literature”. “It was he who gave me my first book by Mark Twain, and with it also novels by Dos Passos, by Steinbeck, even by Kafka and Camus. […] I was probably the only fourteen-year-old in town who read Céline, and only because I was lucky enough to have a grandfather who was passionate about literature”. “It was he who gave me my first book by Mark Twain, and with it also novels by Dos Passos, by Steinbeck, even by Kafka and Camus. […] I was probably the only fourteen-year-old in town who read Céline, and only because I was lucky enough to have a grandfather who was passionate about literature”.But Corey's real goal is to be well liked and loved by his father, who always accuses him of only knowing how to read, a passion that will prevent him from finding a real job and extricating himself in life and for this reason he decides to secretly build a boat to give him. on your birthday: study all the techniques, raise money by collecting glass bottles throughout the city and mowing the gardens of the houses. But things in life don't always go as they should or as we hope, and the mother's fall into severe depression, her grandfather's illness, yet another misunderstanding with her father and a murder, bring down the castles in the air she was chasing. . The Death of the Silver King –proof of debut of Les Edgerton -, originally published in America in 1996, is a novel narrated with a smooth and dry style (apart from perhaps a couple of passages), capable of entering in a precise and profound way into the psychology of all the characters . Period, the one in which the story unfolds, in which domestic violence was considered an evil to bear, in which society still lived in the most sinister racism, in which the balance of power (as still today, to tell the truth) was dictated by the oppression of the weakest: unresolved problems but which, after long and terrible struggles, perhaps we have begun to partially mitigate. Corey makes peace with himself by returning to the places of his adolescence and untying the knot of his last fishing trip with his grandfather in the beautiful and teeming Gulf of Texas: episode that he had hidden in his mind for thirty years but which resurfaces forcefully. And his life, in spite of everything, seems a little more acceptable.Les EdgertonAmerican fiction"},

{"title": "NEW REVIEW BY JOHN JANTUNEN OF ADRENALINE JUNKIE IN CANNERY ROW MAGAZINE", "date": "Sunday, May 22, 2022", "text": "Hi folks,Just got this review of my memoir, ADRENALINE JUNKIE, by John Jantunen in Cannery Row Magazine.   Book  Nook   with  JohnAdrenaline Junkieby Les EdgertonDown & Out Books, USA, Memoir,2018, 344 pages​Reviewby John JantunenIn 2014 Jack David, my publisher atECW Press, rented a van and drove four Canadian mystery writers to Boucherconin Raleigh, North Carolina. Bouchercon bills itself as the largest crimewriters convention in the world and, as a newly published, first-time mysterywriter, the trip would serve as a rite of passage for me as well as provide theopportunity to mingle with my more esteemed peers, most of whom would welcomeme into their fold with a degree of fellowship I’d never thought possible.        And few could have been more welcoming than Les Edgerton.         Imet him on the second night of the conference. Up until then, I admit, I’d beenfeeling a bit like a fish out of water. While the drive down with Jack, JohnMcFetridge, Dietrich Kalteis and Sam Wiebe had been a thoroughly memorable andeven joyful affair, I was beginning to suspect that any hope of capitalizing onthe euphoria I’d felt during the thirteen-hour trip wouldn’t amount to anythingmore than a case of wishful thinking.        My firstinkling that I’d likely been a trifle too optimistic in believing an unknownauthor such as myself might so much as make a ripple in these internationalwaters had been provided by way of the gift tote I’d received upon signing inat the authors' table. In it were a half-dozen free books from some of the convention’s'featured' authors. All were of a decidedly mainstream appeal, quite at oddswith my own reading habits. I knew I wouldn’t read any of them and since mymotel was a thirty-minute walk from the Raleigh Convention Center and I didn’twant to be burdened with them until I'd return to my room that night, I stackedthe pile of books on a table in the lobby of the adjoining Marriott CityCenter, free for the taking.     A few seconds later I saw an older gentleman sorting through themand watched, with idle curiosity, to see which of them passed his muster. Theone he finally chose featured on its cover a cat sitting on a table beside amartini glass, which was about as far as my interest in the book had extendedwhen I first found it in my tote.Jack David would shortly thereafterinform me that it was from a sub-genre of mystery novels called “Cat Cozies”(the most popular in this breed being: The Big Kitty, The Whole Cat andCaboodle, Faux Paws & Hiss Of Death). Call me naïve but it had neveroccurred to me that people wrote books (for adults) in which cats solved crimesand that people (adults!) might actually want to read them. But read them theydo, and by the millions as I soon found out. For the rest of the day, itseemed, whenever I spied someone holding a book, it featured a tabby or calicoon its cover and the 'Cat Cozy' corner in the bookseller’s room sported apermanent line-up - while, I might add, nary a soul was to be seen at the tableselling Cipher. That night I ended up at an eventcalled 'Bar Noir' and my mounting despondency was somewhat tempered by thepromise that 'Noir', another sub-genre, was reserved for those who wrote todiscomfort rather than its opposite. The first reader was a fellow named TomPitts who, I’d later discover, was a transplanted Canadian living inCalifornia. His offering involved a heroin junkie trying to shoot up in thevideo booth at a porn shop whose efforts were constantly being thwarted bya 'dwarf' banging on his door intent on purchasing his used jizz rag. Nowthat, I thought joining in with the audience’s boisterous applause, ismore like it!       The nextreader was a shaven-headed, somewhat elderly author with a handlebar moustachethat, to me, suggested he might have been a retired sheriff from down Texas-way.He was introduced as Les Edgerton and, while it turned out he was indeedoriginally from Texas, I quickly learned that he was about as far removed froma lawman as one could reasonably get.     His piecerecounted a true story from his stint as a convicted felon in an Indianaprison. Apparently the farmer who supplied the prison with beans always threwin a few shovelfuls of gravel to increase his profit. This meant that inmateshad to be constantly on guard when eating the legume but in his story\"Toothache\" the protagonist becomes distracted by one of the cooksattacking a fellow inmate with a meat cleaver and thus bites down on a rockamongst his beans, breaking his tooth. Delivered with such dry wit and grislyhumour, Les’s reading that night at Bar Noir, to this day, stands as the mostcompelling recitation I’ve heard in any of the dozens of literary events I’veattended over the years and, between him and Tom, my mood was on a definiteupswing come intermission. The breakfound me smoking a cigarette on the bar’s street-side patio. One of the perksof the evening was a sampling of North Carolina whiskey. Given that a half-pintof beer cost almost ten dollars Canadian, I’d been keeping an eye peeled forthe waitress in charge of dispensing these complimentary drinks. Having alreadymanaged to snag a couple previously, I was downing my third between drags whenI heard a rather garrulous voice shouting out, “Who's got a smoke? I’m jonesingfor a goddamn cigarette!”Turning, I saw it was Les. Pullingout my pack, I handed a smoke over, assuring him that my CanadianClassics would be the best cigarettes he'd ever tasted. I’m almostcertain he didn’t entirely agree but we still ended up jawing at one of thepatio’s tables for a couple of hours joined by Chicago mystery writer - andformer Def Jam comic - Danny Gardner who’d go on to found Bronzeville Books afew years later (a publishing venture at which a friend from my high school inBracebridge would serve as an editor, another of those funny coincidences Itend to thrive on as a writer).       Lesproved himself as proficient a story teller as he was a reader and ourconversation would give me plenty of fodder for the three minutes I’d beenallotted to introduce myself and Cipher at the EmergingWriters Breakfast the following morning. Les was to sit on one of the panelsthat same day and, naturally, I put his appearance at the top of my 'to-dolist'. He was seated between two law enforcement officers-cum-writers and setthe tone of the discussion early on when he paused briefly while recounting onetale from his seemingly endless repertoire of stories as an outlaw to remarkrather impishly, “I probably shouldn’t be telling this one with so many copsaround,” before boldly charging ahead anyway. But it was something he said afew moments later which would tell me beyond a shadow of a doubt that I hadfound a kindred spirit. Answering a question about whether he had a specificreader in mind while writing, he answered that he didn’t write for a millionreaders, he wrote to find that one reader who might just get it.     In mytwenties I’d read Herman Hesse’s Narcissus and Goldmund, in whichGoldmund is enticed into the artist’s life by a statue he encounters in a smallcountry chapel at a particularly dark moment in his life. Ever since, I’dbecome convinced that art’s true value resided in its potential to instil alonging for a new direction in those ‘lost souls’ who needed it most. I’dbeen inspired by quite a number of writers over the years in my ownefforts to chart a new direction for myself through my fiction but it was rareindeed to actually meet a fellow author in the flesh who, by virtue of his verybeing, seemed to embody such an all-too-often maligned ideal.       Over the intervening years I’ve cometo respect Les's prowess as a writer as much as I do the man himself and thereare no emails I treasure more than the ones I’ve received from him during ourcorrespondence. Les generously offered to provide a blurb for SavageGerry and while he certainly struck at the heart of the matter when hewrote, “This is a novel of the love of men for their sons” - after all I wroteit For Drake (my first son) - it wasn’t until I’d read hisbook Adrenaline Junkie that I’d fully understand the emotionalimperative simmering beneath the surface of these words.        Les leads into his memoir by quoting James Baldwin in thefirst of two epigraphs: “Artists are here to disturb the peace.”Words were insufficient to expressmy sudden elation upon reading that as I literally leapt out of my chair toshare this discovery with my partner Tanja, for James Baldwin’s AnotherCountry plays a pivotal role in In for a Dime and Ihad also chosen another Baldwin quote as the epigraph for my next book, Mason’sJar.        Thecomplete quote in which this line appears is: “Now it is true that thenature of society is to create, among its citizens, an illusion of safety butit is also absolutely true that the safety is always necessarily an illusion.Artists are here to disturb the peace. They have to disturb the peace.Otherwise, chaos.”       I includeit here because, to me, it provides an invaluable key to fully appreciatingwhat Les has accomplished with Adrenaline Junkie, as does whatauthor Marjorie Brody writes in her Foreword: “Les understands that backstorymatters. It influences the presence. So, he journeyed through the pastseeking answers for why he was here . . . Fighting for a moment - regardless ofhow fleeting - to feel in control of his life.”      It was hard notto pause again when reading this, since the only inspirational quote I havehanging on the wall above my computer is a single page torn from a July,2021, Harper’s Magazine article. I’ve highlighted the lastparagraph in Matthew Karp’s “History As End” to serve as both a constantreminder of what I myself am striving for in my writing and as a welcomereassurance that I am far from alone in what often feels like a solitary, andfutile, pursuit of such an ideal.        To quotefrom Karp's article: “The past may live inside the present but it does notgovern our growth. However sordid or sublime, our origins are not our destinies;our daily journey into the future is not fixed by moral arcs or geneticinstructions. We must come to see history . . . as what we fight over, fightfor, and aspire to in practices of justice. History is not the end, it is onlyone more battleground where we must meet the vast demands of the ever-livingnow.” If Les’s brazenly courageous andbrutally honest account of his past is anything, it’s one man’s attempt tocreate just such a battlefield out of his own personal history . . . and what ahistory it turned out to be!      From working athis grandmother’s bar/restaurant in the highly segregated - and oftentimescallously violent - city of Freeport, Texas, during his youth, to his militaryservice as a cryptographer stationed on the Caribbean Island of San Sal, to hislife as an outlaw and professional thief. Then there was, of course, his stintat Pendleton Reformatory - one of the worst prisons in America at the time -during which he’d learn the skills which would lead him to becoming a renownedhairstylist, only to have his career derailed in a self-destructive streakfuelled by his seemingly insatiable appetite for sex and drugs, and finally hismoving on to rediscovering his true calling as an author.       The only corollary within the literary world that Icould think of which even comes close to matching his story would be that ofHunter S. Thompson. But whereas Hunter S. allowed himself to become acaricature, forever trapped in a persona of his own devise, Les is driven bywhat at times seems like an almost pathological desire to keep reinventinghimself, sometimes for the better, frequently for the worse.To be honest, I often had adifficult time reconciling the man he was with the man I’ve come to know. Whilethis dissonance primarily served to bolster the pervasive, and increasinglypalpable, tension which veritably bristles off every page, it also instilled inme a certain reluctance while approaching the last few chapters. It was akin tohow I feel nearing the end of a particularly intricate mystery novel, knowingthat the whole thing could quickly become unravelled by an overly pat or facileresolution that leaves far too little to the reader’s imagination, whereas myfavourite reveals always compel the reader to re-evaluate everything that camebefore, even while pointing towards a far-from-certain future. AdrenalineJunkie, I’m relieved to report, manages this with a similar prowess as Lesbrings to his crime fictions.       In fact, it was a passage from his2011 novel Just Like That which was ever in my thoughts whileI reflected on Adrenaline Junkie. In it his lead character, Jake,is serving time for much the same reasons Les did and, while conversing withhis cellmate about what led him into a life of crime, he reflects that “thescareder I get, the gutsier I become.”      This itselfserves as incisive an explanation of what drives the 'adrenaline junkie' asI’ve ever heard and, where in his past lives Les seemingly allowed this samepropulsive fear to drive him towards imminent self-destruction, ultimately it’shis embrace of that same verve which elevates his memoir beyond a merecataloguing of the extreme turns his life took as a result.      That his ultimate reversal was spurred by the love ofa woman and the birth of his son might have, in less adroit hands, comeacross as trite but, here, it serves only to raise the stakes even further. InMcCarthy’s Blood Meridian, Judge Holden remarks “The stakes is thegame” and it’s a lesson Les seems to have taken well to heart. By using hisfear to force a reckoning with his own past, and damn the consequences, he’sachieved the rarest of all feats; he’s turned what could have been a simplecautionary tale into an epic saga of a man re-imagining what was once hisAchilles heel into his greatest asset and I, for one, cannot think of a morecompelling, nor salient, story for our times than that.Les Edgerton is anAmerican author of 23 books, two of which are on writing fiction, and hastaught at several colleges and universities.  His works, including a variety of short stories, screenplays, essays andarticles, have been nominated for numerous awards and several of his books havebeen translated into Japanese, German and Italian."},
{"title": "First royalty statement for Hard Times from Italian publisher, Elliot Edizioni!", "date": "Monday, May 16, 2022", "text": "Hi folks,I'm very pleased to announced I just received the first royalty statement from Italian publisher Elliot Edizioni and not only did it earn out its advance, it earned almost three times that amount. I take great pride in that. Every one of my books that were on the bookshelves have earned out their advances in the first accounting. It's the key to success.Much thanks to bookseller Mauro Falciano who recommended this book to Elliot Edizioni's Loretta Santini. And, thanks to Loretta for taking a chance on it. More good news--they've contracted to publish Italian versions of The Death of Tarpons and The Bitch this fall.And, a big shout-out and thank-you to my friend Joe Lansdale, who provided a fantastic foreword to the book, which contributed significantly to its success.JOE LANSDALE SAYS(INTRO TO  TEMPI DIFFICILI (HARD TIMES))         Les Edgerton is one of our best and most underrated writers, and that’s a sad moniker to throw at anyone. Underrated.To know you’re doing fine work, and not obscure or abstract work, to wake up and go at it every day, hammer and tongs, with the understanding that you may not be reaching the wider audience you would like or deserve, that’s got to put a kink in your mindset from time to time.        But Les seems to be made of stronger stuff, or has the ability to de-kink the kink and keep moving forward, writing one amazing book after another.When he writes he takes his soul and winds it up and lets it loose and it sails across the literary skies with grace and truth, and damn if just about everyone seems to be looking in the wrong direction.        I once told him, and meant it, that when he writes crime, he my favorite crime writer, though after one of his novels, I have to come up for air for a while before I leap into his next. His books can be that intense.        Thing about Les, though, he’s not just a crime writer. He writes other things. And when he writes crime, he’s not just a crime writer. I like his kind of bonkers approach to fiction, as he both tells the daily truth, and tells the metaphorical truth as well.A storm isn’t merely a storm, an arithmetic award torn in two is more than a piece of paper or a momentary disappointment in the life of his main character in Hard Times. It is the symbol for all she is, and you might say all she will be. The award is ripped in half by an envious boy. This leads to the main character taping it back together and tucking it away. Wounded dreams, deferred, taped up and stored in wishful reserve. That one scene tells you who Amelia is. How she sees life. How she handles it. Any happiness she might have comes with Scotch tape and disappointment.        I have read a lot of Les’s work, and I have liked it all, but this, hands down, pinky-swear, is his finest novel to date. It takes place where I live—East Texas—and though I might have a quarrel here and there with how the location is presented, and a wish for a quotation mark, its minor. How it feels is presented with accuracy. How Amelia feels is unquestioned. He is inside of that character, and I don’t care if he’s an older man writing about a younger girl, a young woman, he remembers youth, and his radar is hot and high and he has picked up the human condition vibrating in the air. He knows people, and seems to best know people who exist on the edge, supported by hot smoke and a doubtful prayer.        This is a dark and grimy story about a young girl growing up, making mistakes, and having to survive under tough conditions and enough disappointment Job might ask for room at the Devil’s table. Even the things that go well for Amelia come with that aforementioned Scotch tape and disappointment.        I never had to deal with the things Amelia has to deal with, but I did deal with being poor, if not being dunked down at the bottom of abject poverty. My family was close to the bone all of the time, and as my father once said, if it cost a quarter to shit, we’d have to throw up. We thought of ourselves as broke, instead of poor, but what we have here is a different mindset. Amelia’s life is down deep in the greasy bucket of existence. A large bucket with slick sides and no easy way to climb out, jump out, and there’s no one to boost her up or to lower down a rope and say, “Take this. I’m pulling your ass out of there, sister.”        And if there was a rope for Amelia, there’s a good chance it would fray and break.        Amelia is in for it. Life is chasing her with an axe, so to speak. Still, she’s after that American Dream.        I believe in it, by the way. I’m a product of it. But it’s a dream that some are better able to grasp. It’s a dream that isn’t constantly snatched away from some. But for others, it’s too far away to reach.        But like Gatsby reaching out for the Green Light from his position on the pier, she never stops reaching. Or at least thinking about reaching.        Let me add, I like how this novel feels, how it is written, how the characters are presented, even more than the plot. Which, is indeed engaging, but this is not a novel of stick figures chasing to the last page. It’s got meat on its bones and blood under its hide.But the color of sweat and despair, the sounds of tragedy and unexpected comedy, the taste of hope covered in shit, will fill a readers head before one truly understands what it all means. Or before one understands that this is a quintessential American novel, in the way Wise Blood is, in the way Gatsby is. It seems simple, but buddy, it means bloody business.        I wish I had written this.        A writer can’t offer another writer greater praise.        Truth is, though, only one writer could have written such a marvelous and constantly surprising book.        Les Edgerton.        And long may he write.   Joe R. LansdaleNacogdoches, TexasBig Bear Manor       Blue skies,Les"},

{"title": "Our next class begins on January 16th--openings available!", "date": "Monday, January 10, 2022", "text": "Hifolks, Well,we’re just finishing up our final week on the current session of my onlinenovel-writing class, “Les Edgerton’s Bootcamp for Writers,” and find ourselvesa couple of openings. Our next session will begin on January 16 and consists ofa ten-week session, with the probability of taking a week off sometime duringthe term to recharge batteries. Thisis a call for new class members. Not sure how many openings we’ll have as weoffer vacancies first to our auditors. Thebasics are the course costs $400 and it’s limited to ten people. The $400 isnonrefundable, as if a person quits during the session it would be impossibleto fill that vacancy. As this is my primary source of income, it would bedetrimental for myself and my family. It’s very rare that anyone opts out oncebegun, however. In over five years, there have only been two. We’vehad a remarkable history of success. Nearly three dozen writers over the pastdozen years who has become a part of our class or whom I’ve coached privatelyhas gone on to being legitimately published and/or secured a good literaryagent. In fact, that is our only goal—to become legitimately published. I try to warn people who arethinking of joining us, how tough the class is, but I know from past experiencethat even so forewarned, at least some are going to be in for a shock when theysee that we really don’t hold hands, pat people on the back for minimumefforts, or overlook writing that doesn’t work. I’m not cruel (at least I don’tthink so) nor are any of the oldtimers in class, but most new folks haven’tbeen exposed to a class like ours. The truth is, most writers who haven’t had aclass like ours has been praised in other classes or most likely, has been inclasses that use the “sandwich” method of teaching. You know—that deal wherethe teach applies a bit of praise, then a bit of criticism, and then a bit ofpraise. Well, that ain’t our shtick. Not even close. The comments we allprovide on everyone’s work fit one definition only. They’re honest.This isn’t to be mean or to act likewe’re the only folks around who know what good writing is. Except… we do. I’mnot aware of any other class out there with the kind of track record oursenjoys. Virtually every writer who stays the course with us ends up with a top agentand/or a book deal. That doesn’t happen in a single ten-week session. About theearliest anyone has earned an agent or book deal in our class has been about ayear. And, that’s reasonable.The thing is, our writers don’texpect things to be easy. I figuredI’d let some of the class members give you their take on our class. They don’thold back and they all have tough skins. They will all tell you the same thing.It isn’t a class for sissies or for those who need their hands held or lots ofpats on the back. Becoming published is hard, hard work and isn’t anundertaking for sissies. To get there, our students know they have to put ontheir Big Boy and Big Girl pants and expect to work harder than they ever havein their lives—and to never, ever “settle” their standards of excellence. From a student several years ago:Hi ________. Since Les opened thefloor for comments from the \"class veterans\" I'm chipping in with mytwo cents. I have a file cabinet filled with stuff I sent Les and then neededasbestos gloves to take the paper off the printer. When I started this journey,I'd never taken an English class past high school. (I was pre-med in college) Ifigured I love to read, so how hard can it be? Okay, quit laughing at me.Clearly, when I wrote my first version of my first novel, I had no idea aboutstory structure, POV, any of that. I figured I'm pretty articulate andtherefore I can write?Les quickly set me straight. All ofthis is to point out that we've all been on the receiving end of Les' brutal honesty.I will find some of the comments he made on my work and post them but phraseslike \"throwing up in my mouth now\" and \"bury this so deep in theyard no one ever finds it\" are seared into my brain and I don't have tolook to find those!!! The point is, I took other classes before I met Les andthe teachers were kind and gentle and never told me I sucked. If it weren't forLes, I'd still be churning out awful drivel that makes people want to throw upinstead of trying not to throw up while I wait to see if my agent is able tosell my book. I would never have gotten an agent without Les. So hang in there.Listen to everything he says and if it doesn't make sense, ask away. From another student:The novel that I am currently tryingto sell has been a work in progress for several years. The first time Les sawit he sent it back and told me to re-write the WHOLE thing!!! My character wasa wimp. She sat back and let things happen to her. I argued a little, rewrote alittle and then moved on to another book. After a year, I went back and rereadit and saw the truth. It was awful. So I took a deep breath and started over.Page one. First sentence. Re-wrote the entire thing. It took a full year andthen I revised it again. It's definitely a process. But once you get the incitingincident and the outline steps down pat, it's a whole lot easier. Trust me!!!And you'll never graduate completely. A few months ago, Les and I wenthead-to-head on one single passage. I was trying to be lazy and take the easyway out. He called me on it and I resubmitted three or four weeks in a row,revisions on the same passage. I was sure my classmates were so sick of it theywere going to stick needles in their eyes rather than read it again! But in theend, the passage rocked!! So hang in there!!!! It'll get better. (Note: Thisnovel sold and the writer is currently working on her fifth novel.) Classmembers come from all over the globe. We’ve had students from the UK, Ireland,Taiwan, Spain, all parts of the U.S., Canada, Australia, Luxembourg and manyother places. We work with writers in virtually every genre on the bookshelves. Theway class works is that the class is divided into two equal groups. We used tohave just one group, but it got to be too much for many students. In the past,everybody in the class was required to read everybody else’s work each week andprovide in-depth comments on everyone’s work. That meant they had to read nineother class members’ work and deliver intelligent commentary on each one. We’vesince evolved to a more manageable number where now each class member reads anddelivers comments on just four other classmates’ work. I provide comments oneverybody’s work and that’s why the class is limited to only ten. With tenwriters, I can give each person the quality of time and analysis each deserves. Eachweek begins on Sunday evening, when people can begin submitting their weeklypages from Sunday until Wednesday. If it’s a new writer to the class, they areallowed to submit their first five pages of their novel, plus an outline whichconsists of five statements and a total of 15-20 words. Oldtimers in class callthis “inciting incident hell.” If the outline isn’t working and their beginningdoesn’t represent the inciting incident as provided in their outline, they arerequired to keep submitting each week until it does. Our feeling is if theyhaven’t thought through their novels sufficiently and provided a publishablenovel structure (evidenced by the outline), then they most likely don’t have anovel ready to be written and to simply plunge ahead will almost invariablylead to an unfinished novel. We don’t want that. Oncethey’ve been okayed for the beginning, from thereafter they can submit up toeight pages per week, along with the others in class. Timezones don’t matter. Everybody’s work, including everyone’s comments and my owncomments on each person’s work each week is posted on the class site and folkscan go to it any time of the day or night. Class members can begin sending backtheir comments on each others’ in their group from Sunday through the followingSunday, when it begins again. Although, in practicality, most members send intheir work each week on Tuesdays and Wednesdays. It’s like being in an“on-ground” class in that everything said or done in class is seen byeverybody. Wedo have a chat function and people use it all the time, even though they’re indifferent time zones. One of the best things about this class is that we havelots of oldtimers who know from their own experience what works in a novel andwhat doesn’t and more importantly… whyit works or doesn’t work. It’s like having a group of seven or eight otherprofessionals helping you with your own novel. Probably at any given time inclass, there will be four or five who already have had a novel or severalpublished as a result of being in class, so it’s a really rarified group. And,if you think that you couldn’t operate in a situation like this because you’rea beginner, that simply isn’t the case here at all. Every single person in eachclass began just the way you did, as a rank beginner. And, they remember andthey have complete empathy for your situation, if you’re a beginning writer. It’snot a situation of simply saying, “This doesn’t work.” Myself and others inclass will surely say that, but we then let you know why it didn’t work andgive you solid suggestions on how to make it work. We collectively have anurturing nature and all of us want the newcomer to succeed just about as badlyas that writer wants to. Besidesclass members, we also have an auditor function which works the same as it doesin a “regular” college class. You’re admitted to class and can view everysingle thing we’re doing and the entire class session is archived and easy toaccess. The cost of auditing the class is $50. If interested in joining us aseither a class member or auditor, just email me at butchedgerton@comcast.net and letme know. If you decide to join us I’ll have our class administrator, Holly, getyou on board asap. Iknow there are no doubt a lot of questions you may have. Please feel free tocontact me at any time and ask me anything you’d like. Frompast experience, when we’ve had openings like this, they go quickly, so if youare interested, please get in touch, okay? Forthose interested in such things, here are a few of my own qualifications toteach writing. MFAin Writing from Vermont CollegeTaughtwriting for the UCLA Writer’s ProgramTaughtwriting via Skype for the New York Writer’s WorkshopWriter-in-Residencefor three years for the University of ToledoWriter-in-Residencefor one year for Trine UniversityTaughtwriting classes for St. Francis UniversityTaughtwriting classes for Phoenix CollegeTaughtwriting for Writer’s Digest Online ClassesTaughtwriting classes for Vermont CollegePublished23 books, including craft books on writing, novels, sports books, YA novel,historical nonfiction book, humor nonfiction, black comedy novel, noir,thrillers, literary and existential fiction.Dozensof short stories published in such publications as The South Carolina Review,High Plains Literary Review, Aethlon, Flatmancrooked, Murdaland, Best AmericanMystery Stories and many others.Alot of living… much of it as an outlaw… Blueskies,Les"},

The award is ripped in half by an envious boy. This leadsto the main character taping it back together and tucking it away. Woundeddreams, deferred, taped up and stored in wishful reserve. That one scene tellsyou who Amelia is. How she sees life. How she handles it. Any happiness shemight have comes with Scotch tape and disappointment.        I have read alot of Les’s work, and I have liked it all, but this, hands down, pinky-swear,is his finest novel to date. It takes place where I live—East Texas—and thoughI might have a quarrel here and there with how the location is presented, and awish for a quotation mark, its minor. How it feels is presented with accuracy.How Amelia feels is unquestioned. He is inside of that character, and I don’tcare if he’s an older man writing about a younger girl, a young woman, heremembers youth, and his radar is hot and high and he has picked up the humancondition vibrating in the air. He knows people, and seems to best know peoplewho exist on the edge, supported by hot smoke and a doubtful prayer.        This is a darkand grimy story about a young girl growing up, making mistakes, and having tosurvive under tough conditions and enough disappointment Job might ask for roomat the Devil’s table. Even the things that go well for Amelia come with thataforementioned Scotch tape and disappointment.        I never had todeal with the things Amelia has to deal with, but I did deal with being poor,if not being dunked down at the bottom of abject poverty. My family was closeto the bone all of the time, and as my father once said, if it cost a quarterto shit, we’d have to throw up. We thought of ourselves as broke, instead ofpoor, but what we have here is a different mindset. Amelia’s life is down deepin the greasy bucket of existence. A large bucket with slick sides and no easyway to climb out, jump out, and there’s no one to boost her up or to lower downa rope and say, “Take this. I’m pulling your ass out of there, sister.”        And if there wasa rope for Amelia, there’s a good chance it would fray and break.        Amelia is in forit. Life is chasing her with an axe, so to speak. Still, she’s after thatAmerican Dream.        I believe in it,by the way. I’m a product of it. But it’s a dream that some are better able tograsp. It’s a dream that isn’t constantly snatched away from some. But forothers, it’s too far away to reach.        But like Gatsbyreaching out for the Green Light from his position on the pier, she never stopsreaching. Or at least thinking about reaching.        Let me add, Ilike how this novel feels, how it is written, how the characters are presented,even more than the plot. Which, is indeed engaging, but this is not a novel ofstick figures chasing to the last page. It’s got meat on its bones and bloodunder its hide. But the color of sweat and despair,the sounds of tragedy and unexpected comedy, the taste of hope covered in shit,will fill a readers head before one truly understands what it all means. Orbefore one understands that this is a quintessential American novel, in the wayWise Blood is, in the way Gatsby is. It seems simple, but buddy, it means bloodybusiness.        I wish I hadwritten this.        A writer can’toffer another writer greater praise.        Truth is,though, only one writer could have written such a marvelous and constantlysurprising book.        Les Edgerton.        And long may hewrite.    Joe R.

{"title": "SF CHRONICLE MENTION OF HOOKED", "date": "Monday, October 4, 2021", "text": "Hi folks,Was just sent this article with a mention of Hooked in the San Francisco Chronicle! I'm jazzed!Scenesfrom the life of a writer trying to write scenesBarbara Lane October4, 2021 The horror genre sometimes getslittle literary praise, but nobody writes plot and dialogue like best-sellinghorror master Stephen King.I met my friend Erin for lunch onClement Street recently. As neither of us was ready yet, COVID-wise, to goinside to eat, we picked up sandwiches at Cafe Bunn Mi and sat down on a benchin front of the Richmond branch of the San Francisco Public Library.I have a long and happy historywith that library. I lived a block away for 25 years, and my son grew up in thechildren’s section. First it was on my lap as an enthusiastic attendee of theaptly named Lap Sit program, at which the librarian read stories. Later, alongwith countless other Richmond District children, he graduated to choosing hisown books and sitting on the carpet to read, and finally to the perfectlykid-sized chairs. I loved that having a child gave me access to that littlepiece of heaven.Erin is a writer and, like me, readsvoraciously. She’s published nonfiction, writes a terrific newsletter and isworking on a novel, so, as it always does, our talk turned to writing.Specifically, dropping into scene.I read more than almost anyone Iknow, and it wasn’t until recently when I started writing (I should saystruggling to write) fiction that I learned about scene. For those of you whodon’t know, a scene is a section of your novel where a character orcharacters engage in action or dialogue. You can think of it as a story withinthe story, with a beginning, middle and an end. A scene has a specific time andplace and point of view. It unfolds moment by moment and usually involvesconflict and emotional change. Ideally, it has a goal. Aha! That was what was wrong with myso-called novel. Too much expository writing. I was making the classic mistakeof telling, not showing. Erin recommended two books that havehelped her with scene: Les Edgerton’s “Hooked” and, even though it’s about screenwriting,Robert McKee’s “Story.” I’ve heard raves from other writers about StephenKing’s “On Writing.”A note about Stephen King: I’m not afan of horror, and for years I ignorantly dismissed King as a mainstreamcommercial writer not worthy of my erudite attention. Then I read “11/22/63,”his novel about a time traveler who attempts to get back to that fateful dayand stop Lee Harvey Oswald’s assassination of President John F.Kennedy.  Masterful, this book taught meplenty. Nobody writes plot and dialogue like Stephen King. I ate crowbig-time.  Since then, I’ve read lots of King, most recently his terrificshort story collection “If It Bleeds.”  Great literary scenes stick in thememory: the fence whitewashing scene in “Tom Sawyer”; Emma Bovary’s eroticcarriage ride with the young clerk Leon; the tea party scene in “The GreatGatsby”; George telling Lenny the fantasy of their little ranch in Steinbeck’s“Of Mice and Men”; the horse-head-in-the-bed scene in Mario Puzo’s “TheGodfather.”  In contemporary fiction, FrancisSpufford writes a stunning opening scene of devastation in his new novel “LightPerpetual,” when a Woolworth’s store in South London and everyone in it isdestroyed by a German rocket. “Mayflies,” Andrew O’Hagan’s latest novel, is fullof vivid scenes of young, small-town, working-class men on a wild adventure atan epic music festival in Manchester, putting the reader right in the middle ofthe madness.   And in Mohsin Hamid’s “Exit West,”any number of conversations between protagonists Saeed and Nadia drop intoscene, doing more than any expository writing could to evoke the harsh realityof their unnamed, war-torn city.  Think of your favorite writer, and Ihave no doubt you can recall a memorable scene or two. A well-written scenemakes a novel sing. After Erin left that day, I wanderedinto the recently reopened library and was hit immediately with that soft,comforting library smell of old books. I walked into the children’s section tofind the kid-sized chair with a plaque bearing my son’s name that I’d “bought”to support the renovation of the building in 2009. And there it was, the samefern-green wood, a beaver painted on its back, at a small table with fivelittle chair mates. I could easily see 3-year-old Harry sitting happily with apicture book.  Wow, I thought. This would make agood scene.·        Barbara Lane Barbara Lane can’tremember a time when she didn’t have her nose in a book. Her column appears everyother Tuesday in Datebook.

{"title": null, "date": "Sunday, November 29, 2020", "text": "INTERVIEW WITH LISA TOWLESHi folks,,Here's an interview I just did with Lisa Towles. AUTHOR SPOTLIGHT: LES EDGERTONStandardLes Edgerton is a multiple award-winning fiction and non-fiction author with 22 books in print. His fiction has been nominated for or won the Pushcart Prize, O. Henry Award, Edgar Allen Poe Award (short story category), Derringer Award, among others. He has a B.A. (with Honors of Distinction) from Indiana University, an MFA in Writing from Vermont College, he’s taught creative writing for the UCLA Extension Writer’s Program, Trine University, St. Francis University, New York Writer’s Workshop, and was Writer-in-Residence for University of Toledo. He is an ex-con who served two years of a 2-5 year sentence at Pendleton Reformatory in the 1960’s for second-degree burglary, and he served 4 years in the U.S. Navy as a cryptographer.As my mentor and personal friend, I had the honor of talking with Les about his upcoming release, Hard Times, his inspirations, and his writing classes below.  You historically create very multi-dimensional villains in your novels, such as Truman Ferris Pinter in your novel The Rapist. How do you do that?I don’t write about villains and heroes. The protagonist is simply the person through whose point of view you receive the story, and the antagonist is the individual whose goals most conflict with those of the protagonist. I don’t see morality as part of either character.Who inspired your legendary character, Lucius Tremaine from your upcoming book Hard Times?He’s based on a hack I knew in Pendleton, who saved my life. His name was Jones and we just called him Jonsesy. I’d received my parole and, not knowing any better, I talked about it – something you just don’t do. If you’ve gotten parole, you have something of value to guard and other inmates know that and take advantage of it. The day after I got my parole and was celebrating it, there was a conflict at the prison barber school that resulted in me chasing another inmate around the room with my straight edge. The guard on duty was Jonesy and luckily he separated us, probably saving my life. But Jonesy saved my life again by not writing me up. Had he done so, I certainly would have kissed my parole goodbye, might have become institutionalized and never gotten out. And I easily could have ended up dead in the process. Jonesy took a huge risk by not writing me up; he could have lost his job and that took a lot of courage. I knew then I had to use his character in a book somewhere down the line, and I did. He’s Lucious.How much outlining do you do personally, and what guidance do you give your writing students about it?Outlining is a requirement in the novel-writing classes I teach online. But it’s probably a far cry from what many people think of as outlining. No pages and pages of Roman numerals. It’s five simple statements, consisting of 16-24 words. Words. Here’s how it works:The first statement is the inciting incident.The next three statements are the result of the three major proactive actions the protagonist takes to resolve his/her story problem.The last statement is the resolution, which must contain both a win and a loss for the protagonist.The thing is, I wouldn’t take a trip to Alaska without a map and I wouldn’t dream of taking the trip of 250-400 pages without a map either. I know from experience that such trips usually peter out around page 80. Such an outline requires thinking through the novel. And as sometimes happens, better actions appear to the writer, and that’s no big deal. They simply sit down and rewrite the outline and they always have a solid guide for the novel. Since close to three dozen people have either published or obtained a good agent over the course of my classes and personal coaching, I think that’s proof that this process works. Even so-called “pantsers” such as Hemingway outlined – he just didn’t call them outlines. He called them “Draft #1,” “Draft #8,” and so on. I used the same outline for a short story, a novel and a screenplay of the same story, The Genuine, Imitation, Plastic Kidnapping.In addition to writing, you’re a deeply committed and inspiring writing teacher. What are some do’s and don’ts for novice writers?Don’t try to “create” characters. Simply go to the deepest part of yourself—that part deep within that nonwriters never want to reveal… and reveal yourself through your characters. It’s extremely hard and most are unwilling or unable to do so, but if you want to create truly memorable work, I think it’s necessary.As for novice writers, I’d urge them to simply try to write the book they wish someone else had written and hadn’t. Don’t worry about what you think you know or don’t know. The only way I know to become a good writer is to be a good reader. If I get someone in class who reads very little, I know that person isn’t going to make it. Read anything and everything you can get your hands on. Jim Harrison said it best: “Read the whole of the past 400 years of Western literature and, if time permits, read the same of Eastern literature. For if you don’t know what passed for good in the past, how can you know what passes for good today?”How do your writing classes work?I teach 10-week classes that go on continually. When we finish one, we take a two-week break and begin the next one. Classes are purposely small – only 10 writers at a time, because I spend a lot of time with everybody’s work. The fee is $400 for the class, and you can also audit the class for $50, which means you can see what everyone else is doing but you’re not an active participant. The goal of each class is to have everyone become published well. Right now, we’re at week 5 of the current class – taking a week off to recharge batteries and then the final stretch, after which we’ll have a two-week break and start anew.

Therefore, I think you are the bestpossible audience to let know what recently happened to me.As you know, it takes a lot to create abook. In my case, I average about a year for each book. Since writing is myonly job, that’s a year without pay. Then, once the book is done, I have tofind an agent, and/or find a publisher. Once a publisher is found, that’s notthe end of it. Now there are edits to perform. All of this takes time and work.My next novel, for example, took a little over a year to write and I actuallysold it seven months ago. It’s scheduled to launch in November. A long timefrom when I wrote the first words.There are a lot of things arrayedagainst the publishing of a book and a lot of time to wait on a paycheck if itovercomes all the obstacles. Up until now, it’s just been part of the deal.Nobody likes it, but we all accept it.And now, one more obstacle has beenthrown into the mix. And this is a big one.As you know, unless you’re a brand-nameauthor, any publicity you get for your work is hard won. Mostly, publicity foryour work consists of reviews for it. And, virtually the only place reviews canbe placed and seen is on Amazon. Authors have little to no control over thereviews they get. Folks buy and read your book and then post their opinions ofit on Amazon. Hopefully, their reading experience was positive and so is thereview they write and post. Not always. And, we have no control over that.Over many years, I’ve received manyreviews for the books I’ve written. Thankfully, the vast majority of them havebeen positive. Very few negative ones. And, they’ve helped tremendously withsales.Imagine how I felt when about a weekago, I decided to check the number of reviews I had for my books. I knew acouple were getting close to those “magic” numbers that trigger Amazon’salgorithms and once achieved, leads to them including your titles in variouspromotions. I’m not sure what those numbers are, but someone told me that 50reviews was one of them. A couple of my books were approaching this number.One that had been close was my novel,THE GENUINE, IMITATION, PLASTIC KIDNAPPING. I hadn’t checked in several weeksbut the last time I had it was at 48 or 49 or thereabouts. When I clicked onthe title, I received a severe shock. A bunch of reviews that had been on itfor months and sometimes years, had disappeared. They only showed 23 reviews!After telling several writer friends and notifying the publisher, I was hugelydisappointed in their responses. A couple of friends said things like, “I’veheard of them doing that,” and offering their condolences, and the publishersaying the same things, but no one offered to help me figure out what had happenedor what my recourse could be.It took some digging and trying tofigure out Amazon’s maze to reach an actual person, but I finally did. I sentan email and a couple of days later, received this:                Hello,        For privacy reasons, I can only discuss specific Customer Review removals    with the person who originally posted the review.        However, I can tell you that reviews are typically removed from the    Amazon.com website for one of four reasons:        1. The review conflicted with our guidelines (http://www.amazon.com/review-guidelines).    This includes reviews that were posted as promotional content.    2. The review was removed by the customer who submitted the review.    3. We discovered that multiple items were linked together on our website    incorrectly. Reviews that were posted on those pages were removed when the    items were separated on the site.    4. We detected unusual review behavior.

Oh… also, by this time,reviews for another book of mine, BOMB!, had vanished close to 40 reviews ormore and there were only 11 left!

Up to this point I had been polite and restrained, but this wastoo much. Here’s what I sent Justin (or whatever his or her real name was):Justin WThis is totally unacceptable.This is out and out censorship. Someone is systematically removing dozens ofreviews from my books and I have no recourse to see who or why they wereremoved? This flies in the face of everything that is American and is more akinto something done in a repressive country like Russia, Cuba, North Korea orChina.Of your four \"reasons\"I cannot think of a single review I have ever received that would apply to anyof those criteria.i have spent literally thousandsand thousands of dollars on Amazon books and other products. This is simplyvenal and evil.Les EdgertonI don’t know what to do. I guess I’mhoping that enough of you will forward this to friends and make it go viral andmaybe Mr. Bezos will see it and realize the kind of censorship his minions areperforming. Probably not. If you think this can’t happen to you, think again.Someone in a cubicle or working from his mom’s basement seems to have controlover you and your livelihood.Or maybe thousands of you will rise upand flood Amazon with millions of reviews for my books. Yeah…I’ve just never felt this helpless. Idepend on your wonderful reviews to help sell my books and to have some halfwitjust take them down for one of their “reasons” arbitrarily because his mommyforgot to put the jelly on his PB&J sandwich or wash his tidy whities ontime just makes me want to meet this dude in a dark alley and “talk” to him. Ican face my accuser in a court of law, but I can’t face the unknown moron whois messing with my livelihood on Amazon. It’s clear they have us writers by theshort hairs and care nothing about our rights. This is a cautionary tale—thisis what monopolies like they’ve become often do.If anyone has any idea of any recourse Imight have, please let me know. I’m just sick. This is symptomatic of manyother things happening to our country and our rights.Blue skies,Les"},
{"title": "JIMMY WYNN, THE \"TOY CANNON\" HAS PASSED AWAY.", "date": "Saturday, March 28, 2020", "text": "Hi folks,A former casual acquaintance of mine, Jimmy Wynn, aka \"The Toy Cannon\" former player for the Houston Astros, has just died at 78. I met Mr. Wynn at a Super Bowl in Houston when the Minnesota Vikings lost me a few thousand dollars.. I honestly don't even remember who they played--Miami? Doesn't matter and I'm not looking it up. I imagine most people who went to a Super Bowl would remember who played but I'm 77 and don't care any more. Anyway, we had seats on the 50-yard line and Jimmy sat directly behind us. I spent the entire ballgame talking to him--he was far more interesting than the game. (Did I mention I lost several thousand dollars on it? That, I remember.) Anyway, he was fun to talk to and I remember him much more than the lousy game (on which I lost a lot of money...) The entire game cost me $100, believe it or not. I belonged to a group of gamblers--high-rollers--led by a guy named Stan Pitzak, who owned the Linebacker Inn, across from where I worked near Notre Dame,. and Stan had his own plane on which he flew a bunch of us down on. The game was supposed to be in the Super Dome, but they had flooding or something and it was moved to Rice Stadium,. Where I lost a few thousand dollars and met Jimmy Wynn. We ate afterwards at a seafood restaurant just across from the San Jacinto Monument and when I returned home and mentioned to my mother where we'd eaten she told us my great grandparents had founded the restaurant. I think this story is in my memoir, Adenaline Junkie, but not sure. After all, I'm 77. I do remember I lost several thousand dollars betting on that sorry QB Fran Tarkenton, who continued to throw passes to receivers covered by multiple defenders, ignoring wide-open receivers who were begging for the ball, but seemed to be in Mr. Tarkenton's blind spot. That was the main subject of our conversation--Mr. Tarkenton's bad eyesight, which was costing Jimmy some hard-earned greenbacks as well. Never seen a TV broadcast of that game so don't know if it was obvious on TV as well, but it sure was to our group of gamblers and Mr. Wynn, who I believe had excellent eyesight. RIP, Jimmy! You could sure rip the cover off a baseball.Blue skies,Les"},
{"title": "SIT IN ON A SERIOUS WRITING CLASS DURING THE SELF-QUARANTINE", "date": "Saturday, March 21, 2020", "text": "Hi folks,I’d like to throw out something for yourconsideration. We’re in a national crisis as you know where an awful lot of usare staying home to do our part in defeating the Coronavirus, To make our self-imposedexile from each other even worse, our entertainment options have been severelycurtailed with the cancellation of most sporting events, concerts, plays andmany of the normal outlets we enjoy. As a writer, one positive thing is thatpeople are reading more and book sales are up.There is one thing that is available tothose of you who are writers or have often wondered if they have the skills tobe a writer. As most of you know, I host an online novel-writing class. We’vehad enormous success over the years with nearly three dozen people who’veattended our classes and/or been coached by me privately having succeeded inpublishing their novels over the years. I don’t know of any other class withour kind of class record.Class members of an early class, all of whom became published (with the exception of Joe who is the husband of Maegan Beaumont whom he's standing next to.)We also have another service we offer.For quality control, each class is restricted to ten people. That way I canspend sufficient time with each classmate and they can spend time with eachother as well. So we can’t add new classmates. But we have another popularfeature. We often have class auditors. Those are folks who sit in on our classand see everything we’re doing. The only difference is they can’t participateactively. They’re observing just like auditors in any college course. It’sextremely valuable to every level of writer—from the raw beginner to thepolished professional. We’ve even had agents audit from time to time. Agentsaudit to scout potential talent and are the only people we don’t charge. Theyprovide a valuable service for our participants.All writers make the same errors thatprevent them from getting published. Over and over, we see the same mistakesrepeated. That’s why auditing is so valuable. Writers often don’t see their ownflaws, but when they see the same things they do repeated in other writers andsee why it’s not a positive trait and why, it informs their own writingtremendously. I had one auditor who held an MFA from a good university tell meafter auditing our class that he’d learned more in ten weeks than he had in theentirety of his university experience. That’s probably because our only goal isto see each of our classmates become published and published well.Two of my books we use in class.There’s another benefit to auditing.Whenever we have an opening, we go first to our auditors and offer them theopportunity. Also, many times a newer writer is unsure about their ability.Sitting in class and watching everyone else’s work and approach is aneye-opener. Very often, they see their own level of ability reflected in othersand it raises their confidence. By the same token, often auditors see that theyhave holes in their writer education but see clearly how to fill those holes.All in all, it’s a great experience for a writer of any level of experienceand/or ability. It’s simply demystified.Okay. Sales pitch over. Just wanted tolet folks know of our existence and availability. We’re just beginning thesecond week of this session and everything we’ve done to date is always on thesite to study. The cost for full membership in class is $400, but the fee forauditing is only $50.This is a great time to join us! Justseeing what we do will give many a sound idea where they are as writers and foradvanced writers, you’ll see work that will inform your own work and take youto another level. And, for not much money at all!If interested or if you have additionalquestions, please shoot me an email at butchedgerton@comcast.net.Hope to see some of you looking over ourshoulders soon!Blue skies,LesJust a couple of the novels written in class."},
{"title": "NEW CLASS TO BEGIN", "date": "Monday, February 10, 2020", "text": "Hi folks,Well, we’re just finishing up our final weeks on the current session of my online novel-writing class, “Les Edgerton’s Bootcamp for Writers,” and find ourselves with a couple of openings. Our next session will begin on March 8 and consists of a ten-week session, with the probability of taking a week off sometime during the term to recharge batteries.This is a call for new class members. Not sure how many openings we’ll have as we offer vacancies first to our auditors.The basics are the course costs $400 and it’s limited to ten people. The $400 is nonrefundable, as if a person quits during the session it would be impossible to fill that vacancy. As this is my primary source of income, it would be detrimental for myself and my family. We’ve had a remarkable history of success. Nearly three dozen writers over the past dozen years who has become a part of our class or whom I’ve coached privately has gone on to being legitimately published and/or secured a good literary agent. In fact, that is our only goal—to become legitimately published.Two of our published novelists--Maegan Beaumont and Linda Thompson (the ugly guy in the middle is moi...I try to warn people who are thinking of joining us, how tough the class is, but I know from past experience that even so forewarned, at least some are going to be in for a shock when they see that we really don’t hold hands, pat people on the back for minimum efforts, or overlook writing that doesn’t work. I’m not cruel (at least I don’t think so) nor are any of the oldtimers in class, but most new folks haven’t been exposed to a class like ours. The truth is, most writers who haven’t had a class like ours has been praised in other classes or most likely, has been in classes that use the “sandwich” method of teaching. You know—that deal where the teach applies a bit of praise, then a bit of criticism, and then a bit of praise. Well, that ain’t our shtick. Not even close. The comments we all provide on everyone’s work fit one definition only. They’re honest.This isn’t to be mean or to act like we’re the only folks around who know what good writing is. Except… we do. I’m not aware of any other class out there with the kind of track record ours enjoys. Virtually every writer who stays the course with us ends up with a top agent and/or a book deal. That doesn’t happen in a single ten-week session. About the earliest anyone has earned an agent or book deal in our class has been about a year. And, that’s reasonable.The thing is, our writers don’t expect things to be easy.I figured I’d let some of the class members give you their take on our class. They don’t hold back and they all have tough skins. They will all tell you the same thing. It isn’t a class for sissies or for those who need their hands held or lots of pats on the back. Becoming published is hard, hard work and isn’t an undertaking for sissies. To get there, our students know they have to put on their Big Boy and Big Girl pants and expect to work harder than they ever have in their lives—and to never, ever “settle” their standards of excellence.From a student several years ago:Hi. Since Les opened the floor for comments from the \"class veterans\" I'm chipping in with my two cents. I have a file cabinet filled with stuff I sent Les and then needed asbestos gloves to take the paper off the printer. When I started this journey, I'd never taken an English class past high school. (I was pre-med in college) I figured I love to read, so how hard can it be? Okay, quit laughing at me. Clearly, when I wrote my first version of my first novel, I had no idea about story structure, POV, any of that. I figured I'm pretty articulate and therefore I can write.Les quickly set me straight. All of this is to point out that we've all been on the receiving end of Les' brutal honesty. I will find some of the comments he made on my work and post them but phrases like \"throwing up in my mouth now\" and \"bury this so deep in the yard no one ever finds it\" are seared into my brain and I don't have to look to find those!!! The point is, I took other classes before I met Les and the teachers were kind and gentle and never told me I sucked. If it weren't for Les, I'd still be churning out awful drivel that makes people want to throw up instead of trying not to throw up while I wait to see if my agent is able to sell my book. I would never have gotten an agent without Les. So hang in there. Listen to everything he says and if it doesn't make sense, ask away.From another student:The novel that I am currently trying to sell has been a work in progress for several years. The first time Les saw it he sent it back and told me to re-write the WHOLE thing!!! My character was a wimp. She sat back and let things happen to her. I argued a little, rewrote a little and then moved on to another book. After a year, I went back and reread it and saw the truth. It was awful. So I took a deep breath and started over. Page one. First sentence. Re-wrote the entire thing. It took a full year and then I revised it again. It's definitely a process. But once you get the inciting incident and the outline steps down pat, it's a whole lot easier. Trust me!!! And you'll never graduate completely. A few months ago, Les and I went head-to-head on one single passage. I was trying to be lazy and take the easy way out. He called me on it and I resubmitted three or four weeks in a row, revisions on the same passage. I was sure my classmates were so sick of it they were going to stick needles in their eyes rather than read it again! But in the end, the passage rocked!! So hang in there!!!! It'll get better. (Note: This novel sold and the writer is currently working on her fifth novel.)Class members come from all over the globe. We’ve had students from the UK, Ireland, Taiwan, Spain, all parts of the U.S., Canada, Australia, Luxembourg and many other places. We work with writers in virtually every genre on the bookshelves. We agree with Nabokov that there are only two genres--good writing and bad writing.The way class works is that the class is divided into two equal groups. We used to have just one group, but it got to be too much for many students. In the past, everybody in the class was required to read everybody else’s work each week and provide in-depth comments on everyone’s work. That meant they had to read nine other class members’ work and deliver intelligent commentary on each one. We’ve since evolved to a more manageable number where now each class member reads and delivers comments on just four other classmates’ work. I provide comments on everybody’s work and that’s why the class is limited to only ten. With ten writers, I can give each person the quality of time and analysis each deserves.Each week begins on Sunday evening, when people can begin submitting their weekly pages from Sunday until Thursday. If it’s a new writer to the class, they are allowed to submit their first five pages of their novel, plus an outline which consists of five statements and a total of 15-20 words. Oldtimers in class call this “inciting incident hell.” If the outline isn’t working and their beginning doesn’t represent the inciting incident as provided in their outline, they are required to keep submitting each week until it does. Our feeling is if they haven’t thought through their novels sufficiently and provided a publishable novel structure (evidenced by the outline), then they most likely don’t have a novel ready to be written and to simply plunge ahead will almost invariably lead to an unfinished novel. We don’t want that.Inc inc hell...Once they’ve been okayed for the beginning, from thereafter they can submit up to eight pages per week, along with the others in class....and go on to win the pennant!Time zones don’t matter. Everybody’s work, including everyone’s comments and my own comments on each person’s work each week is posted on the class site and folks can go to it any time of the day or night. Class members can begin sending back their comments on each others’ in their group from Sunday through the following Sunday, when it begins again. Although, in practicality, most members send in their work each week on Wednesdays and Thursdays. It’s like being in an “on-ground” class in that everything said or done in class is seen by everybody.We do have a chat function and people use it all the time, even though they’re in different time zones. One of the best things about this class is that we have lots of old-timers who know from their own experience what works in a novel and what doesn’t and more importantly… why it works or doesn’t work. It’s like having a group of seven or eight other professionals helping you with your own novel. Probably at any given time in class, there will be four or five who already have had a novel or several published as a result of being in class, so it’s a really rarefied group. And, if you think that you couldn’t operate in a situation like this because you’re a beginner, that simply isn’t the case here at all. Nearly every single person in each class began just the way you did, as a rank beginner. And, they remember and they have complete empathy for your situation, if you’re a beginning writer.It’s not a situation of simply saying, “This doesn’t work.” Myself and others in class will surely say that, but we then let you know why it didn’t work and give you solid suggestions on how to make it work. We collectively have a nurturing nature and all of us want the newcomer to succeed just about as badly as that writer wants to.If you are still interested but still feel intimidated, I think if you simply look at how the class works, you’ll quickly see how you’ll fit in comfortably. Since we’ve got two weeks left in class, for anyone who would like to see up close and personal how we work as a class, I’d be delighted to give you auditor status for our last week. Besides class members, we also have an auditor function which works the same as it does in a “regular” college class. You’re admitted to class and can view every single thing we’re doing and the entire class session is archived and easy to access. Normally, the cost of auditing the class is $50, but for our last week, for those interested in simply getting a look at how we work, just email me at butchedgerton@comcast.net and let me know and I’ll have our class administrator, Holly, get you on board asap.I know there are no doubt a lot of questions you may have. Please feel free to contact me at any time and ask me anything you’d like.From past experience, when we’ve had openings like this, they go quickly, so if you are interested, please get in touch, okay?For those interested in such things, here are a few of my own qualifications to teach writing.MFA in Writing from Vermont CollegeTaught writing for the UCLA Extension ProgramTaught writing via Skype for the New York Writer’s WorkshopWriter-in-Residence for three years for the University of ToledoWriter-in-Residence for one year for Trine UniversityTaught writing classes for St. Francis UniversityTaught writing classes for Phoenix CollegeTaught writing for Writer’s Digest Online ClassesTaught writing classes for Vermont CollegePublished 20 books, including craft books on writing, novels, sports books, YA novel, historical nonfiction book, humor nonfiction, black comedy novel, noir, thrillers, literary and existential fiction.Dozens of short stories published in such publications as The South Carolina Review, High Plains Literary Review, Aethlon, Flatmancrooked, Murdaland, Best American Mystery Stories and many others.A lot of living… much of it as an outlaw…Blue skies,Les"},
{"title": "Two Reviews of the Italian version of THE RAPIST", "date": "Friday, July 19, 2019", "text": "Hi folks,Just received these reviews of the Italian version of THE RAPIST.Review by Katia MontanariAuthor: Les EdgertonTranslation:Annarita GuarnieriPublisher:Meridiano ZeroGenre:RomancePages:116Yearof publication: 2019Select Language​▼Synopsis. Forgetthe hard-boiled, forget the noir, forget everything you think you know aboutthis genre. With a disdainful grin \"The Rapist\" gets rid ofevery canonical element and presents something that aspires to be much morethan what a single genre can offer. A controlled testimony of misanthropyand disappointment that recalls Dostoevsky's \"Memoirs from theUnderground\". But while the protagonist of the work of the greatRussian author feeds on anger, Edgerton's is nourished by a horrible narcissismand an inhuman and bestial nature that peeps out like a stalker through hiseloquent language and his grandiose ideas. In this novel based not so muchon plot as on narration, Edgerton guides us in the mind of Truman Pinter andleaves us there, alone, to look after ourselves and find the road thatwill take us out of the darkness. How much of what Truman says we candismiss as the delusions of a sick mind? And how many times do we have tostop and listen, looking for a glimmer of truth?Review\"TheRapist\" is an excellent novel, partlyprovocative, sometimes disturbing, which cannot leave you indifferent. Thelanguage chosen by the author is highly sought after, almost courtly,deliberately interrupted by outbursts of raw vulgarity that are perceived as high-pitchedscreams. Truman,the protagonist, tells his story in the first person.Heis a prisoner, sentenced to death for rape and murder waiting for execution ondeath row. He appears as a pedantic, cultured, wealthy man, lacking inempathy who has an altered and totally personal vision of life and values.Manythings are considered legitimate or not based on our morality and emotion butthey would appear differently if analyzed from a purely rational point of view.Hisarguments concerning rape, life, death and marriage are extreme and debatable,but even in the passages in which his thought seems delirious, a clearawareness can be seen that gives strength to the true communicative intent ofthe author.Through some rhetoricalfigures and fitting dialogues you will be drawn intothe deep abysses of a lucid madness, to the secrets hidden in Truman'sunconscious and you will arrive, almost without realizing it, in a strong andmeaningful ending.Les EdgertonLes Edgerton wasborn in Odessa, Texas. He served for four years in the United States Navy. Later,he was sentenced to two and a few months for second-degree burglary. Fouryears after he was released from prison, he attended Indiana University inSouth Bend, where he was elected President of the student body and was a sportseditor for the campus newspaper. He later earned an MFA in writing atVermont College. He writes short stories, articles, essays, novels andscreenplays. Edgerton's works have competed for the Pushcart Award, O.Henry Award, Edgar Allan Poe Award (short story category), Jesse Jones Award,PEN / Faulkner Award, the Derringer Award, and the Violet Crown Book Award.Les Edgerton - The RapistCecilia | 6 July, 2019Odoya Publisher Zero Meridian / Out of Series Year 2019 Genre noir 120 pages - paperback and epub Translation by Annarita Guarnieri\"Yes it caused me. Yes she drowned. Yes I could have saved her. No I didn't try to do it \"You are can be depraved and crazy. Violent and misogynistic. Criminals and rapists. Human nature is fallacious due to genetic programming but one cannot be all this and think also clearly to be right, to have grandiose ideas. Or maybe yes because everything is played on morality. And when one is really deprived of it then all the conventions and the judgments fall together, because one can judge a person who makes a mistake not a monster that feeds on his own degenerations.Who is Truman Pinter? He himself tells us this in a long narrative where the action takes place mainly in the memories of an exalted psychopath who explains his nature never daring to give himself perverse, but only talking about plans. Pinter always has a plan that he first elaborates mentally and then tries to actually put it into practice. Sometimes it fails but when it does it explains it and justifies it by appealing to its own nature and instincts. Kidnap women and make cannon fodder. And even when he is captured and the people of his country, as well as hanging him, he would like to castrate him first so that he can send him to the other world, however crippled, he laughs at us. Truman is angry but also a narcissist and in prison he speaks and tells,The Rapist can be understood only by reading it from the first to the last page because the term \"unsettling\" only partially makes what readers find themselves understanding page after page. It is an indefinable novel because it cannot be cataloged in any specific genre. It has echoes of madness of its own and a storyline that when you think it can make you remember another story and another story turns suddenly and changes register. For lovers of long literary monologues it can immediately appear really interesting but after the first enthusiasm of the initial chapters fully understand that the story in pictures is something that goes beyond the same story to lead to a work of introspection that leaves no quiet at all. Reading The Rapist is a real experience where Edgerton seems to have tried one chapter after another without having any initial canvas and at times even carelessly bothering the reader. The pages flow to the bitter end until the same author is no longer able to hold up the monster he created and concludes the story before Truman Pinter engages himself. The result is a hallucinatory novel, something never seen before and that must be read absolutely because even readers sometimes need to close a book thinking that maybe they could not understand everything but that is fine. The pages flow to the bitter end until the same author is no longer able to hold up the monster he created and concludes the story before Truman Pinter engages himself. The result is a hallucinatory novel, something never seen before and that must be read absolutely because even readers sometimes need to close a book thinking that maybe they could not understand everything but that is fine. The pages flow to the bitter end until the same author is no longer able to hold up the monster he created and concludes the story before Truman Pinter engages himself. The result is a hallucinatory novel, something never seen before and that must be read absolutely because even readers sometimes need to close a book thinking that maybe they could not understand everything but that is fine.Antonia del SambroThe writer: Les Edgerton grew up in Texas and Indiana, serving two years in the Pendleton penitentiary during the 1960s for burglary. The sentence is the result of a plea bargain that has reduced dozens of thefts to a single charge, an armed robbery and a drug dealing accusation. Before this \"small problem\" Les served for four years in the US Navy as a cryptographer. After obtaining conditional release from Pendleton, Edgerton received his bachelor's degree (with honors) from Indiana University.Today he is a full-time writer and creative writing teacher. He has published eighteen books in a wide variety of forms: novels, short stories, essays, scripts and writing manuals. One of his most famous works is the Hooked essay: Write Fiction That Grabs Readers at Page One and Never Lets Them Go. The book I prefer is his collection of short stories called Monday's Meal, which received a brilliant review by The New York Times in which Les is compared to Raymond Carver."},

I figured I'm pretty articulate andtherefore I can write?Les quickly set me straight. All ofthis is to point out that we've all been on the receiving end of Les' brutalhonesty. I will find some of the comments he made on my work and post them butphrases like \"throwing up in my mouth now\" and \"bury this sodeep in the yard no one ever finds it\" are seared into my brain and Idon't have to look to find those!!! The point is, I took other classes before Imet Les and the teachers were kind and gentle and never told me I sucked. If itweren't for Les, I'd still be churning out awful drivel that makes people wantto throw up instead of trying not to throw up while I wait to see if my agentis able to sell my book. I would never have gotten an agent without Les. Sohang in there. Listen to everything he says and if it doesn't make sense, askaway.From another student:The novel that I am currently tryingto sell has been a work in progress for several years. The first time Les sawit he sent it back and told me to re-write the WHOLE thing!!! My character wasa wimp. She sat back and let things happen to her. I argued a little, rewrote alittle and then moved on to another book. After a year, I went back and rereadit and saw the truth. It was awful. So I took a deep breath and started over.Page one. First sentence. Re-wrote the entire thing. It took a full year andthen I revised it again. It's definitely a process. But once you get the incitingincident and the outline steps down pat, it's a whole lot easier. Trust me!!!And you'll never graduate completely. A few months ago, Les and I wenthead-to-head on one single passage. I was trying to be lazy and take the easyway out. He called me on it and I resubmitted three or four weeks in a row,revisions on the same passage. I was sure my classmates were so sick of it theywere going to stick needles in their eyes rather than read it again! But in theend, the passage rocked!! So hang in there!!!! It'll get better. (Note: Thisnovel sold and the writer is currently working on her fifth novel.)Classmembers come from all over the globe. We’ve had students from the UK, Ireland,Taiwan, Spain, all parts of the U.S., Canada, Australia, Luxembourg and manyother places. We work with writers in virtually every genre on the bookshelves.Theway class works is that the class is divided into two equal groups. We used tohave just one group, but it got to be too much for many students. In the past,everybody in the class was required to read everybody else’s work each week andprovide in-depth comments on everyone’s work. That meant they had to read nineother class members’ work and deliver intelligent commentary on each one. We’vesince evolved to a more manageable number where now each class member reads anddelivers comments on just four other classmates’ work. I provide comments oneverybody’s work and that’s why the class is limited to only ten. With tenwriters, I can give each person the quality of time and analysis each deserves.Eachweek begins on Sunday evening, when people can begin submitting their weeklypages from Sunday until Thursday. If it’s a new writer to the class, they areallowed to submit their first five pages of their novel, plus an outline whichconsists of five statements and a total of 15-20 words. Oldtimers in class callthis “inciting incident hell.” If the outline isn’t working and their beginningdoesn’t represent the inciting incident as provided in their outline, they arerequired to keep submitting each week until it does. Our feeling is if theyhaven’t thought through their novels sufficiently and provided a publishablenovel structure (evidenced by the outline), then they most likely don’t have anovel ready to be written and to simply plunge ahead will almost invariablylead to an unfinished novel. We don’t want that.Oncethey’ve been okayed for the beginning, from thereafter they can submit up toeight pages per week, along with the others in class.Timezones don’t matter. Everybody’s work, including everyone’s comments and my owncomments on each person’s work each week is posted on the class site and folkscan go to it any time of the day or night. Class members can begin sending backtheir comments on each others’ in their group from Sunday through the followingSunday, when it begins again. Although, in practicality, most members send intheir work each week on Wednesdays and Thursdays. It’s like being in an“on-ground” class in that everything said or done in class is seen byeverybody.Wedo have a chat function and people use it all the time, even though they’re indifferent time zones. One of the best things about this class is that we havelots of oldtimers who know from their own experience what works in a novel andwhat doesn’t and more importantly… whyit works or doesn’t work. It’s like having a group of seven or eight otherprofessionals helping you with your own novel. Probably at any given time inclass, there will be four or five who already have had a novel or severalpublished as a result of being in class, so it’s a really rarefied group. And,if you think that you couldn’t operate in a situation like this because you’rea beginner, that simply isn’t the case here at all. Nearly every single personin each class began just the way you did, as a rank beginner. And, theyremember and they have complete empathy for your situation, if you’re abeginning writer.It’snot a situation of simply saying, “This doesn’t work.” Myself and others in classwill surely say that, but we then let you know why it didn’t work and give yousolid suggestions on how to make it work. We collectively have a nurturingnature and all of us want the newcomer to succeed just about as badly as thatwriter wants to.Ifyou are still interested but still feel intimidated, I think if you simply lookat how the class works, you’ll quickly see how you’ll fit in comfortably. Sincewe’ve got one week left in class, for anyone who would like to see up close andpersonal how we work as a class, I’d be delighted to give you auditor statusfor our last week. Besides class members, we also have an auditor functionwhich works the same as it does in a “regular” college class. You’re admittedto class and can view every single thing we’re doing and the entire classsession is archived and easy to access. Normally, the cost of auditing theclass is $50, but for our last week, for those interested in simply getting alook at how we work, just email me at butchedgerton@comcast.netand let me know and I’ll have our class administrator, Holly, get you on boardasap.If you're interested but don't feel you're ready to begin writing your novel, we also offer the opportunity to audit class for $50.00. It works the same as auditing a regular college class on the ground. You sit in on the class and see everything we do--you just don't actively participate. It's a valuable experience as most of the things the writers in class experience are the same problems every writer faces. It's also a great way to see how we work and make entering a future session much more comfortable. Just contact me at butchedgerton@comcast.net and we'll get you on board. I've had countless participants tell me it was an extraordinary experience for them. One guy told me he'd learned more about how to structure and write a novel in just ten weeks of observing our class in action than he had during his MFA years. That's probably because we're teaching actual writing techniques that work and nothing on contemplating our navels...Iknow there are no doubt a lot of questions you may have. Please feel free tocontact me at any time and ask me anything you’d like.Frompast experience, when we’ve had openings like this, they go quickly, so if youare interested, please get in touch, okay?Forthose interested in such things, here are a few of my own qualifications toteach writing.MFAin Writing from Vermont CollegeTaughtwriting for the UCLA Writer’s ProgramTaughtwriting via Skype for the New York Writer’s WorkshopWriter-in-Residencefor three years for the University of ToledoWriter-in-Residencefor one year for Trine UniversityTaughtwriting classes for St. Francis UniversityTaughtwriting classes for Phoenix CollegeTaughtwriting for Writer’s Digest Online ClassesTaughtwriting classes for Vermont CollegePublished20+ books, including craft books on writing, novels, sports books, YA novel, historicalnonfiction book, humor nonfiction, black comedy novel, noir, thrillers, memoir, literary and existential fiction.Dozensof short stories published in such publications as The South Carolina Review,High Plains Literary Review, Aethlon, Flatmancrooked, Murdaland, Best AmericanMystery Stories and many others.Alot of living… much of it as an outlaw…Blueskies,Les"},

That really sucked. So will this!When WR sold out of Finding Your Voice, my then-agent Chip MacGregor took my reverted rights and self-published it for me. It's done well since.

{"title": "NEW BOOK FINISHED!", "date": "Tuesday, February 26, 2019", "text": "Hi folks,A bit of news today… I finally finished anovella I’ve been working on for at least two years. I’m pretty sure my agenthad given up on it (and me) months ago. I don’t believe in writer’s block—no,wait—I didn’t use to believe in writer’s block… but man!—this puppy has broughtme to my knees. It’s based on the first short story I ever wrote and hadpublished—Hard Times—which I wrote when I was 13 and which got a Pushcart Prizenomination and is included in my short story collection, Monday’s Meal. My agent, Svetlana Pironko, read it a long time agoand a few years ago told me it had haunted her ever since. She urged me toexpand it into a novel, which I couldn’t quite do, but did manage to get it tonovella length.I had a good friend who I won’t name just yet,who’s just become head of a publishing company who’s been after me for a book—actuallyseveral books—and I was happy that Svetlana sent it to him yesterday. What’sreally cool is that his company pays actual advances that are decent and theirbooks end up on bookstore shelves and aren’t POD but actual books. I am tryingto remain cool about this, but it’s hard.And now, since I finally got through thisbook, I can begin writing three books I’ve put on hold that I’ve been itchingto get to. This just feels like freedom!Also, here’s some new reviews of AdrenalineJunkie. It’s been difficult getting reviews because I find myself at 76 fairlypoor—SS and my online class are my only sources of income—which means I can’tafford to buy copies of my book and send them to folks for reviews and Isuspect my friends are probably as poor as I am and can’t afford to buy a copyeither, but thankfully, some have. I can’t begin to tell those people how muchI appreciate it! Anyway, like the first ones, these folks seem to have likedit, too.Alec Cizak5.0 out of 5 starsThey Don't Make'Em Like This AnymoreFebruary13, 2019Format: PaperbackReading Les Edgerton's Adrenaline Junkie is alot like sitting in a bar listening to a guy tell you stories you refuse tobelieve are true (spoiler alert: The stories are true). His writing isstraight-forward and wastes no time with filler. Frankly, he doesn't have thespace to waste. Edgerton packs so much information into a single paragraph, itgets dizzying. The most valuable aspect of this book, however, is itsdemonstration of an unrestrained approach to life I fear is going to become athing of the past as unbridled attempts at free living are deemed unacceptable.This is a document, a testimony to spending your brief life the way YOU wantto, as opposed to the way the spineless masses would prefer.Liam Sweeny5.0 out of 5 starsLong Strange TripJanuary 20, 2019Format: Kindle EditionI've been a longtime fan of Les Edgerton's.Now, if you've ever read any of his work, you probably love all thatgritty-yet-approachable narration, that \"life on the edge\" grimoirethat you have a hard time putting down. This book is like the Genesis chapterof the Bible of all his other works. This is the memoir of the marauder, andLes writes it in a way that isn't painting heroes and antiheroes. Is it alittle sexy? Sure, but it's as glorious as the big score is right before theflashing red-and-blues smack you in the face from your rear-view mirror.I was graciously given an advanced copy. Membership has privileges, folks.Livius Nedin5.0 out of 5 starsA terrific rideJanuary 20, 2019Format: PaperbackAdrenaline Junkie feels like an open andhonest look back at one's life. Les is an interesting guy with great stories totellChloe5.0 out of 5 starsHold your breath - this ain't your typical memoir!February 21, 2019Format: Kindle EditionI'm a longtime fan ofLes Edgerton's brilliant writing, and must say his pulp noir is so enthralling,when reading those I always felt I was riding shotgun alongside the characters,and long after completing said books, remembered lines and situations. Fewauthors can write with such depth, readers actually recall portions of thenovels days/weeks/months after they've put down the book.AdrenalineJunkie is not a tale, albeit reads like one. I put it on my Christmas list, andthen caught a virus that took me out for a month until I finally felt likereading again. I've already Re-gifted my book to my sister, who grew up nearFreeport, TX, and is the same age as Les. She will enjoy it as much as I didb/c we are southern ladies but we have Grit.Unlikehis amazing fiction (some based heavily on his life and some only lightly)Adrenaline Junkie pulled me in as I was curious about the real man writing suchmemorable and in-your-face books. If you've read The Rapist in which Edgertontakes readers into the mind of a psychopath, you wonder what influenced him. Thismemoir enlightened me on so many unanswered questions and there is nothing asrefreshing to me as Edgerton's brutal honesty.Ifyou can't handle the good, bad, and ugly, surely you will appreciate the witinfused at necessary times to get you through this rather bizarre tale thatshaped this author's unique life.Ronald Hampton5.0 out of 5 starsAn examination of ones life opens doors!February 9, 2019Format: PaperbackLes was a high schoolbuddy of mine.Toread his life story left me stunned . Very few of us experience a calamity ofdeeds that Les reveals. Violent crime, a plethora of sex and romance. Then asimple act allows Les to redeem himself!

{"title": "MY \"NEW\" DAUGHTER!", "date": "Tuesday, January 1, 2019", "text": "Hi folks,Just got some pictures of my \"new\" daughter Maria. She, her husband Joe and her daughter Nikole (my \"new\" granddaughter!) came down from South Bend to our home in Ft Wayne, and all my other kids were there as well--Britney, Sienna and Mike--along with their spouses and Mike's girlfriendVictoria (who's like a daughter). It was a wonderful, wonderful day!Here are some photos from that day.Joe, Maria and NikoleMe and all my kids--Britney, Sienna, (me) Mike and MariaMike and VictoriaMe and MaryMy grandson Logan (Sienna's son), Sienna, Britney, Mike, Maria and Nikole.Sienna's boyfriend, Jamie (cut in half, alas!) Britney and her husband Ray.Here's the story of how Maria came to find me:A Thanksgiving MiracleA woman who had been adopted 51 yearsago was suffering from some physical problems and decided to submit a DNAsample to Ancestry.com in hopes of discovering who her birth parents were forthe possibility of getting some of her health history for her and her daughter.Maria’s search turned up my name and sheGoogled it and found out my memoir, Adrenaline Junkie, had just been released.She obtained a copy of it and read:(From Adrenaline Junkie)About a week later, a detective dropped by the apartmentwhile Sherry was at work and told me I would probably walk on my charges, getprobation like my lawyer’d said. He said I’d beat them. Then, he dropped a bombon me. He said that even though I had a good chance of walking, they were goingto go after Sherry and would make sure she got sentenced and did time at theIndiana Women’s Prison. He told me some things about her past that convinced methe judge probably would give her at least six months in the joint. Thedetective said the only way I could save her ass was to plead guilty and if Idid that, they’d drop the charges completely on Sherry. He also spent a lot oftime telling me what would happen to her down at the Women’s Prison inIndianapolis. Things other inmates would do to her with broomsticks, stuff likethat.This stuff got to me. Sherry was pregnant with our childand this guy kept telling me our kid would be born in prison and end up infoster homes being abused. Stuff like that.I decided to plead guilty. The deal was, I would cop toone count of second-degree burglary and they would drop all the other burglarycounts, plus all the other charges, the armed and strong-arm robberies. I mightstill get probation, I was told, but even if I didn’t, the most I’d get wouldbe a two to five-year sentence or maybe a one-to-ten on the burglary thing.That was a laugh. They weren’t even consideringprobation. As soon as I pled guilty, I was let back out on my original bond fortwo weeks while they did the presentence investigation and when I went back, Iended up getting a two to five and sent over to the jail to await paperwork andtransportation to Pendleton Reformatory.During the two-week period of the presentenceinvestigation, Sherry and I got married and I made arrangements for my sisterJo and her husband Jim to take Sherry in during her pregnancy in case I gotsent up. They lived in Lakeville and had two kids of their own, but both ofthem had big hearts and didn’t even hesitate when I asked them to take her in.Sherry hadn’t wanted to get married, but I didn’t want our kid being born a bastard.Once I in Pendleton, Sherry visited a couple of timesand then I didn’t see her any more. Her letters stopped as well. Normal shitfor cons. Then, I got a letter from a lawyer asking my consent for a divorce. Iwouldn’t sign it, and then my sister wrote me a letter saying they had had tokick Sherry out. It seems she was eight months pregnant and one day mybrother-in-law Jim was painting the living room and she walked up to him on theladder and grabbed his johnson and told him she wanted to screw him. He was arighteous dude and told her to get fucked and also to pack her shit and leavetheir house, which she did. Jo apologized over and over for having to kick herout, but I thought she showed remarkable forbearance, as did Jim, for whatshe’d done. I signed the divorce papers, but a few months later, I was servedwith some more papers asking if I’d  allowSherry to put the baby (it was a girl) up for adoption. I refused to sign them,and wrote my sister to see if they would consider keeping the baby until I gotout and could care for her. They immediately agreed—great sister!—but Sherrytold all of us to get fucked and put the baby up for adoption anyway. It turnedout they didn’t need my signature to do that, even though I was the legalfather. You forfeit all such rights when you’re in prison. So our little girlwas adopted and I’ve never seen or heard of her since.When I got released a couple of years later, I went to aminister and told him my story. I wanted to know if he thought I should try tolocate my daughter and get her back. He advised me to leave things the way theywere. “She’s in a good home now,” he said. “Parents who love her and who shethinks of as her mom and dad. You can’t take care of her at this time, so leaveher alone. She’s better off.” I saw he was right and did as he suggested. Manytimes since then I have wondered if I did the right thing. I also wonder ifshe’ll ever try to look me up. I hope her life turned out all right. I hope ifshe ever does look me up she’ll understand why I didn’t try to find her.(End of excerpt)She found my email address and mailed methis:Hi,I recently did my Ancestry DNA and apparently we are closely related. I wasadopted at birth. I have no biological family information, including medicalhistory. I don’t know if you have or are willing to give me any information onwho I am, but if you are I would appreciate it. Thank you. Signed, MariaWe emailed back and forth and soonestablished that she was my daughter. Then, she said something that meant theworld to me:I was sooverjoyed to read in your book that you wanted me and that you tried everythingto keep me. That it was in there, without your ever knowing if I would read it,means that it was how you really felt and that means more than if I had beentold that my birth parents named me this or did this or that.MariaSince then, we’ve met in person, Maria has met her two sisters and herbrother and we got to meet my granddaughter Nikole when they all came to visityesterday. I don’t know if I’ll ever make much from Adrenaline Junkie butI’ve already realized a miracle worth everything from its existence.And that's our story. Kind of amazing, I think. What's also interesting is that Maria and I look alike and maybe more than any of my other kids!Anyway, it's made this holiday season a very, very special one.Blue skies,Les"},

Fortunately, I've only had two seriouslysuicidal people recently and one who was homicidal/suicidal, and all threeended well. I also train all new hires. In 2013, I had a several tumorsremoved, one of which was over 5 lbs, and apparently was not breathing for alittle while during the surgery. During that same time, I had to be cut open inthe doctor's office to relive some bleeding that was pooling and apparentlycould kill me. The doctor had to cut me open in her office, without benefit oranesthesia, or even Listerine, (I asked), I didn't yell at all, not wanting toscare the other patients, but my poor husband passed out. Apparently, I wassqueezing his hands too hard. He is a very wonderful man. We spent a lot of2011-2013 in and out of hospitals, (everything is good now), and it was veryhard on him, so he goes a little overboard on the protective side sometimes,but I figure he earned it. He is very excited to meet you. The tumors andcancer were what started my quest in earnest, as I had no medical history. Wehad my daughter checked and she was at risk for some of the same things I had,which we dealt with immediately, so she won't have to go through the years ofpain, but I wanted to try to find out everything I could to help ensure herhealth. I didn't dare hope I would actually find a close family member, letalone birth father. I had applied for my birth certificate, as soon as itbecame possible on July 15, but still have not received it. I had noinformation to go on, it was a closed adoption, didn't list even a city ofbirth, my birth certificate was actually issued April of 1968, my birthdaybeing Oct 8, 1967. My dad offered to help, but I wouldn't have put him in thatposition, he always worked so hard to protect me, I wouldn't knowingly createanother issue for him. Finally knowing that I have family and that familywanted me and wants to meet me, is wonderful to hear and over whelming. I amvery excited to meet you and hope that I do not disappoint. I am overjoyed tohear I have more siblings, too!!See you Monday!MariaSome moretidbits…Maria, I was \"downstate\" when you wereborn, but I'm pretty sure it was in Memorial. When Sherry put you up foradoption (against my will), she'd given you a name but didn't tell me. But youhad a legitimate birth and a legitimate mother and father. That was veryimportant to me and why I insisted she marry me, so that you wouldn't beillegitimate. I don't understand why none of this info was made available toyou. You weren't some illegitimate baby at all. I wish I could tell you moreabout Sherry but I was only with her for a few months. She was a very smallblonde and worked in the office of an insurance company and I don't recall thename, alas.Blue skies,LesI was so overjoyed to read in your book that youwanted me and that you tried everything to keep me. That it was in there, withoutyour ever knowing if I would read it, means that it was how you really felt andthat means more than if I had been told that my birth parents named me this ordid this or that.Maria            Well,we met in person when Maria and her husband Joe came down and spent Mondayevening with us. I can’t begin to describe the feelings I experienced duringthat time. Maria looks like me (poor girl!) and it turns out we share a lot ofgenetic traits. She’s already corresponding with her new sisters, Britney andSienna, and they’ve all made plans to meet and are all excited to have a newsister(s). Mike is also anxious to meet his new sister.She’s just an amazing person and I’m soblessed to have been able to meet her and begin a relationship with her. Thetiming of this is just incredible. AdrenalineJunkie had just come out a day before she found out I was her father andI’d written about her in it and it meant the world to her to find out she wastruly wanted. She told me she’d always had a feeling of being unwanted all herlife and it meant so much to her to find out her birth father had really wantedher. So that’s it. I have a new daughter andmy life has been immeasurably enlarged and blessed. As happens so often, truelife is much more interesting than fiction! If I never make a dollar from mymemoir, I’ve already earned a treasure from its existence.Blue skies,LesP.S. If you’re interested, a fullaccount of Maria’s birth situation is in my memoir.ORDER HERE"},

Hope you enjoy the read!Editing by ElizabethWhat We Say Ain’tAlways What We Mean… By Les EdgertonIt’s an honor to welcome Les Edgerton back to the site. Thereare a lot of people out there writing noir, but Les is the real deal. His lifeexperiences give his writing a verisimilitude you can’t learn from a book orearn via an MFA (though he has one of those). Over the years, Les has sharedwith readers anecdotes from his fascinating life. Now, in large part as ajourney of introspection and the desire to figure out how he arrived at thispoint in his life, Les has finally put pen to paper and memorialized hisamazing life story, Adrenaline Junkie (Down & Out Books), forposterity. Despite having lived a life packed with more action than mostever dream of, Les is here today to explain that, at least in the world ofwriting, “action” doesn’t necessarily mean what you might think it does.A MAJORFLAW IN TEACHING CREATIVE WRITING (FICTION) EFFECTIVELY LIES IN OURTERMINOLOGY: What we say ain’t always what we mean…I read a lot of blogs from other writers, agents, editors andother professionals in the writing game, and I read a lot of letters fromwriters responding to those posts. Alas, again and again, I see some generalmisconceptions about writing techniques and story structure that I’d like toaddress.I see the same misconceptions from my students in my onlineclasses and from clients I work with.The misconceptions seem to arrive from misunderstanding thedefinitions of the terms we employ in describing fiction writing and fictiontechniques.I’ve come to believe that much of the misunderstandings writershave stem from the fact that many of our terms are lay terms, and while thedefinitions assigned certain terms have their root in “lay” or “dictionary”definitions, there are significant differences when applied to writing, and itis these differences that cause a certain amount of confusion.That sounds like a lot of goobly-gook, doesn’t it? Sorry! I’lltry to explain better.A good example of what I’m talking about that I’ve seen a lotwritten about lately refers to the term “action” in fiction. A nonwriterusually thinks of action in reference to drama—books, movies,plays, and television—as some kind of physical activity. Many times, the wordevokes images of melodrama—bombings, kidnappings, shootings, stabbings,beatings, rapes… violent physical action, in other words. Lots of noise,screams, smoke, and fury. Writers need to think differently and understand thataction in fiction means something much more than in real life.I just read a letter on another blog from a beginning writer whocomplained that she began her novel with action—in her case, an armed robberyinvolving her protagonist—and then couldn’t figure out why this didn’t hook theagent she’d sent it to. She said he turned her manuscript down because whilethe robbery hooked him in the very beginning, it turned out to be mostlyunrelated to the story that followed. This poor writer had done what a lot ofwriters seem to do. She thought that when teachers, agents and editors saidthey wanted to be “hooked” immediately on the first page, they were looking forsomething along the lines of that lay definition of action. A gun going off orwhatever.Not.The term “action” when applied to fiction means something vastlybroader and more encompassing of other activities than the stuff listed above.While it can include those kinds of activities, literaryaction also encompasses many other things. Dialog is action, for instance. Acharacter driving down the road and seeing a dead plover is also action. Acharacter reading a newspaper on the subway is action. Anything a characteris doing is action.This one misunderstood term is to blame for many of the mistakesmade in creating a manuscript, especially when trying to follow the advice ofthe pros.For the rest of this article, go to here  Blue skies,Les"},

Les Edgerton isnever afraid to reveal his vulnerability—and culpability—as he takes us on ahead-spinning ride through the bizarre and terrifying experiences in a lifethat was often defined by violence. The result is a breathtaking page-turnerthat will keep readers hooked from page one and will never let them go.” —LisaLieberman Doctor, former Warner Bros. prodco president, president of RobinWilliams prodco, Blue Wolf Productions“Filled with stories of knifings, armed robberies, brutal prisonfights, and Charles Manson (yes, that Charles Manson!), Edgerton proves thatlife can be stranger (and certainly more violent) than fiction. But Edgertonisn’t just a guy with a tough story to tell. He’s a poet who startles you withsentences both stark and darkly beautiful. An astonishing accomplishment.” —JonBassoff, author of Corrosion“Adrenaline Junkie is the compelling, beautifullywritten story of an extraordinary man who has lived on both sides of thetracks. Les Edgerton achieves a sort of sainthood among sinners, an apotheosisof rebellion and force, much like Harcamone at Fontevrault, or a hero in aJohnny Cash song, a huge, Promethean work of major significance and scale.”—Richard Godwin, critically acclaimed author“Edgerton’s prose hits with the force of a hammer—as does hisrecollection of an America, both deeply flawed and wonderful, that is now moreimportant than ever to keep in our sights. Adrenaline Junkie makessense of one man’s life while showing us all new aspects of our own.” —JennyMilchman, USA Today bestselling and Mary Higgins ClarkAward-winning author of Cover of Snow and Wicked River“No one can accuse Les of being a ‘crime tourist’. He’s lived thelife, done the bird, and now he’s written the book. Adrenaline Junkie shouldbe on any prospective (or established) crime writer’s list. An entertaining,darkly-rendered tale of one man’s adventures in the very belly of the beast.”—Tony Black, author of Her Cold Eyes“Sometimes shocking, often poignant, occasionally distasteful,frequently funny, and always brutally honest, Adrenaline Junkie tellsthe story of one man’s harrowing yet ultimately successful quest forredemption. Written with razor-sharp clarity, Edgerton’s memoir is a triumph.”—Robert Rotstein, author of We, the Jury“Adrenaline Junkie will be required reading for crimewriters one day, a bible for future authors to study rebellion and the humanspirit, that smart-ass spark inside us all that doesn’t like taking orders fromparents, teachers, and even the law. Author of The Rapist and TheBitch, two of the most profound noir novels published, an ex-criminal andformer prison inmate, Edgerton knows what makes all of us tick, and how, withnot much of a shove, any one of us could end up behind bars. One of the mostfascinating autobiographies you will ever read: from professional thief andpimp to award-winning author and teacher.” —Jack Getze, author of theaward-winning Austin Carr Mysteries“Adrenaline Junkie is at once heartbreaking as it isfunny, and just plain sick. A masterful work that will be lauded by bothwriters and the general reading public alike.” —Vincent Zandri, NewYork Times and USA Today bestselling and ThrillerAward-winning author“Edgerton is a back-alley Kerouac. Walk away from this knowingthat your life-defining moments were his slow Tuesdays.” —Liam Sweeny, authorof Presiding Over the Damned“In a way, Edgerton already wrote Adrenaline Junkie inhis crime novels. With the veneer of fiction removed, his always entertaining,often enlightening, sometimes infuriating and unapologetic stories hit evenharder. Without any doubt, Edgerton is one of the great storytellers offiction—and now non-fiction.” —Benjamin Sobieck, author of The Writer’sDigest Guide to Firearms and Knives“Having survived an American Gothic horror story of a childhood,unrepentant former thief, dope dealer, hedonist, Navy hellraiser, and pornactor, Les Edgerton—now a writer and teacher—tells a tale of many tales: IfScheherazade were an old pirate who got away with the gold, this would be hisopus.” —Earl Javorsky, author of Down to No Good“Les Edgerton’s expertly told memoir is in turns tragic,thrilling, funny and heart-breaking. Adrenaline Junkie is apowerful blend of coming-of-age story, family drama and low-life crimethriller.” —Paul D. Brazill, author of Last Year’s Man“Edgerton has lived a life most of us only write about. That he’sactually lived it and has the chops to deliver such a vividly drawn memoirgives me a raging case of writer’s envy.” —Maegan Beaumont, award-winningauthor“How often is a memoir genuinely astounding? A reformed outlawtakes us through his harsh rural childhood, working harder before he was twelvethan most of us ever will. There follows armed robbery, pimping, drug dealing,rape in prison, narrowly avoiding a hellcat’s castration attempt, suicidefoiled by the rope breaking, a walk on part for Charles Manson and his creepyserial killer mate—who got short shrift from our host. And so much more…So manystartling sentences: ‘She was going to be his last fuck before the operationand I was going to be his first after he became a woman.’ ‘It was then CharlesManson started to contact me…’ There’s a satisfying twist late on after hebecomes a family man so this fascinating book has just the right ending.Essential reading. Makes Bukowski seem like Donny Osmond.” —Mark Ramsden,author of The Dark Magus and the Sacred Whore“A tryst with Brit Ecklund, a shoot-out in a deserted high school,robbing a laundromat in front of a patrol car. Those are just a few moments isLes Edgerton’s checkered past. He went from a Huck Finn-like childhood inTexas, the swinging sixties as a criminal, time in Indiana’s Pendleton prison,and eighties excess in New Orleans, with little slowing him down until a goodwoman found a way. Funny, harrowing, and poignant in spots, reading AdrenalineJunkie is like being lucky enough to sit at the bar next to that guywho has lived a lot of stories and knows how to tell them. Yes, Les Edgertonwas an adrenaline junkie and he always knew where to get a fix.” —ScottMontgomery, MysteryPeople Crime Fiction Coordinator"},

And ahumdinger of a prologue it is, too.See, asa writing teacher, Edgerton advocates that his students write openings that hook the readeremotionally so they can’t help but read more.Well,try this…Writingof his time in Pendleton Prison in the 1960s, Edgerton says that every nightthe prison DJ would play Porter Wagoner’s The Green, Green Grass ofHome. And every night in a cell above his, Les would hear another of theinmates crying.“Andthen, one night, we didn’t hear the guy sobbing. I remember that just like itwas yesterday. In the morning, after we got back from chow, here came a bunchof hacks, carrying a body down the tier walk wrapped in a bloody sheet. It wasthis guy. He’d cut his wrists the night before.”Cut to:Edgerton, out of prison, years later, driving along the road with radio on.Oncomes the song Green, Green Grass of Home:“All ofa sudden, I was blinded by uncontrollable tears and had to pull over to the sideof the road before I ran into somebody.“Isn’tit funny that at the time of your misery you don’t feel the emotion, but later,when you’re in a good place, you do? It’s just funny, isn’t it…”Becominga writer – and becoming a manAndthat, Edgerton says, is what this book is about:“A lotof moments in my life—some good and some bad—and how they formed me. I’ve had achaotic life and that’s been on purpose. I’ve consciously sought out as manyexperiences as I was able to and I tended toward seeking out dangerousexperiences—that’s what triggers the adrenaline and adrenaline is my drug ofchoice.”Not badfor a prologue. We already have emotion and a compelling hook. And this isbefore the story proper has begun, of course.Here –for those keeping score and paying attention and all that – is how this memoirreally begins:“When Iwas eleven, my father walked into his bedroom and caught me stuffing several ofthe coins he collected and kept in a sock in a dresser drawer, into my pockets.Most of them were foreign coins he’d picked up overseas during World War II andI have no idea how I planned to spend English half-pence or GermanReichspfennig coins or if I even planned to spend them at all. I just wantedthem because I thought I could take them without getting caught. After he puthis belt away, and I pulled my pants back up, my father made me take four ofthe smallest coins and swallow them.”And nowwe have a story, ladies and germs.For the rest of Damien’sreview, click here.Thanks for a really thoughtfulreview, Damien.Blue skies,Les"},

{"title": "NEW REVIEW OF HOOKED", "date": "Thursday, November 1, 2018", "text": "Hi folks,A new review of my craft book, HOOKED, has just appeared on European author Damien Seaman's blog. Here is how it appeared:Damien SeamanHow to write better, faster and moresuccessfullyHowto get publishers to *really* read your bookIN-DEPTH REVIEW: Hooked: Write Fiction That GrabsReaders From Page One And Never Lets Them Go, by Les EdgertonClick hereI won’tmince words.Hooked! is awriting guide you need to own if you are serious about your fiction writing.What doI mean by serious?Well,the book sets out to help you write something “publishable” and is very clearabout what that means in terms of story structure.So,serious means if you want to get a publishing deal (or a good agent to representyou).Or ifyou want to sell more self-published books – because what publishers want isdictated by what readers seem to want.Eitherway, this book is for you.Author Les Edgerton has published 20 books plusinnumerable short stories and magazine articles during his career. He has alsotaught creative writing, and been nominated for several awards for his fiction.He hasa good idea of what sells, in other words.How towrite a sellable manuscript to a quality pressAlthoughhere I introduce a note of caution.Les isnot a huge bestseller, and he does not teach how to write the doorstepblockbuster novels you buy in airport bookstores. He knows how to write asellable manuscript to what he calls a “quality press”.He’salso very clear that the technical limitations of what publishers will buy arestrict.“Novelsand short stories, no matter how complex their plots may appear, are almostalways based on a simple underlying structure: A character begins in stabilityin his world; this word becomes unstable after the introduction of an incitingincident; the character struggles to restore his stability; and a new stabilityis established at the conclusion,” Edgerton writes.So far,so uncontroversial. At least to most of us. But then Edgerton continues:“Whatis different about today’s story structure is that the first part of theequation – stability – has been shortened considerably and, in many cases,completely omitted.”Inother words, this book is a master class on story structure as expressedthrough the microcosm of a book’s opening.Readers– and publishers – want to be hooked from the very first line, Edgertonexplains. They want an opening that grabs them and pulls them through the book.What aninciting incident is – and how to get it rightSo, weget a lot here about the importance of the inciting incident – what it is andhow to use it properly.This isessential reading. Also essential to read more than once. Why? Because it’sactually pretty hard to grasp in practice. Or, at least, I’ve found it to beso.It’s aconcept that seems laughably simple. Until you try to apply it to your own workand you realise you have a certain blindness – or lack of ruthlessness – aboutwhat an inciting incident really is, and whether or not your book has one.As aresult of this, Les asserts that a great many books start in the “wrong place”.Indeed, he has said this to me about one of my books – one that was previouslypublished.Sobelieve me when I say this is essential knowledge and essential to apply overand over until you are utterly confident that you get it.A lotof tricky concepts, each one explained with practical examplesFromthe inciting incident idea, Edgerton takes through related concepts:·        Story-worthy problems – what they are, how to come up with themand how to write them into your manuscript·        Surface problems – how they differ from story-worthy problems,and why, and how to juggle the two·        How these problems relate to your character – and to your reader·        Setup and backstory – how much the modern manuscript shouldcontain, plus exceptions to the rule·        How to combine the inciting incident, story-worthy problem,initial surface problem, setup and backstory in a way that seems natural andengages your readerAs youcan see, there’s a lot to take in. Which is why it’s not just worth buyingthis, but reading through multiple times and then applying to your work inprogress as soon as you can.I speakfrom recent experience, as at the time of writing Les has been eviscerating astory opening of mine. And I thought I knew this stuff!As Isaid, this is a book for writers who are serious about improving their craft.But not just that. It’s for writers at all levels of experience.I’vepublished two novels with two different small publishers and there’s materialin here that I only now realise I didn’t grasp as thoroughly as I thought Idid.I wouldwager it’s the same for you.Readthis book at least twice if you’re serious about your writingInsummary, buy this book. Read it at least twice. First time for pleasure. Secondtime, make notes. As many as you need to. Ask questions. Read it a third timeto look for the answers to your questions.Nowapply it to what you’re working on.

{"title": "OUTLINING YOUR NOVEL", "date": "Wednesday, September 19, 2018", "text": "Hi folksFrom time to time, I rerun the following material in hope of reaching new audience members. This is basic material, but I've found that oftentimes new writers have never been exposed to some of the material.This is the exact handout all new members of my online novel-writing class receive and are required to adhere to. It works, as evidenced by the fact that nearly three dozen writers have had their novels published or gained good agents after writing their novels with us.I hope that you gain value from it. A lot of it may seem like old wine in new bottles and it is, but it sometimes pays off when reviewing material we may have forgotten.One thing I've noticed is that sometimes writers feel they don't want to outline. Been there, done that. However, please read the following with an open mind. It may help that I don't believe in those outlines Missus Gundy used to have us write back in PS 101--those ten-page long monstrosities with Roman Numerals. The outline described here consists of five statements and 15-25 words. Period. You can write it on a postcard or a napkin. Those who've given it a try though  swear by it.Okay. Sales spiel over...Once I convinced our beagle Buddy to use an outline, he was able to finish his book. True story...OUTLININGA STORYLesEdgerton            Likea lot of writers, I wasted a lot of time in my writing career simply because Iignored what is probably the biggest \"secret\" in creating shortstories and novels. I didn't outline.            Outlineswere a particular type of hell English teachers visited upon you - those horridthings with Roman numerals and topics and subtopics and all that junk. Yuch!Outlining took all the fun out of reading a book.            Ialso read interviews with writers who said they never outlined. It woulddestroy their \"creativity\" many claimed. The way to write a story wasto create a character, start them out in trouble and kind of follow them aroundas they had neat adventures. What it took years to realize was that mycharacters had great adventures and it was kind of fun following themaround...until somewhere between pages eight and twenty when they would peterout. I had a drawerful of some of the best starts of stories you ever saw.Problem was, they never went anywhere. And most of them never came close to anending. Oh, a few did, the really short ones. There were even one or two thatcame to a respectable length...after rewriting them twenty times.            WhatI didn't realize for the longest time was that writing involves the processingand integration of large blocks of trivial bits of information. As the lengthof my stories grew, so did the complexity. All of a sudden, I was on pagethirteen and I suddenly remembered I couldn't have my character chase the badguy...because on page two I'd given him bronchia asthma. I had to go back and\"cure\" him. What I didn't realize was something pretty obvious. Astory, like the life it represents, is basically complex. Stories aren't builtlike a line of dominoes, it more resembles a web, and when you tug a bit harderon one of its many strands, the whole business vibrates. And changes shape. Notonly did I have to remember the many details and their connections, I had tokeep them in a logical order. Virtually impossible.            Ieven managed to write several books in this manner. Looking back on those daysI cringe. What an awful lot of energy I needlessly wasted!            Herewas my typical process. I bet at least some of you have gone through the sameprocedure. I'd get a great idea, so great that I'd have to drop the baby if Iwas holding him, and fly to my typewriter. (Remember - this was in the days ofyore when they had those ancient artifacts...) As fast as my fingers could fly,I'd write. A hundred words would accumulate. Then, two hundred. Then...well,then I began to run into problems.            SomethingI did in the first hundred words didn't quite fit with the three hundredth, butI wasn't quite sure what it was. Something was just \"off\". It wouldbother and confuse me, but I didn't want to deal with it. So, I'd push on, fixit later, whatever it was. Just get the stuff out, in the white heat ofcreativity. That's what rewriting was for, right? To fix stuff that didn't fit.            Onlynow the writing really slowed. The next fifty words were the hardest. I wasrunning out of steam. The idea I'd begun with seemed stale, trite. If I couldeven remember the original idea. Crap! I'd say, finally, slamming shut thetypewriter case. Maybe tomorrow the Muse would redescend...            Hardlyever happened. On the morrow, a new idea would strike, with the same kind ofheat as the first one and I'd be off and running with that one.            Withthe same results.            Inno time at all, I had boxes of unfinished stories. Sound familiar?            Well,I learned a trick. I won't go through the whole sorry history of how I wastedtime and learned, little by little, to work smarter. What happened, after manycenturies (well, it seems like that now) was that I began kind of jotting downa half page of notes. I even began figuring out my endings before I began.            NowI began to finish stories. Not a lot, but a lot more than I had previously.After a couple of years of this, I began to expand my notes. Never once did Ithink of what I was doing as \"outlining.\" There weren't any Romannumeral. How could that be an outline?            Andthen...one day I got one of those Joycean epiphanies. What I was doing was anoutline! But, these weren't outlines like Missus Grundy had us doing back inP.S. 121. These were just notes. Notes kind of organized. And I discoveredsomething else. Those old writers were liars. Hemingway, Steinbeck andShakespeare - they all claimed they didn't outline, but they had to. Theirstuff all held the kind of integrity that only comes in thinking through aproject first before you pick up the saw. They just said they didn'toutline. All of a sudden, I knew better. Those guys probably didn't think theyoutlined either. I doubt if any of them had Roman numerals on their noteseither. I'd bet money they had notes, though, and copious notes...and copiousnotes organized into some kind of system. Before they ever picked up the ol'writing quill and wrote \"Chapter One\". Probably what a lot of themdid was write a first draft...and then used that for their \"outline\".Without calling it that, of course, or even thinking of it in that way. I betthat's what they did though. They weren't any different than I was. Or you. Ifany writer begins their story without knowing precisely where they're going,any mistakes they make at first, any tiny omissions, take on added significanceas he or she proceeds. As length grows linearly, complexity expandsexponentially. Fact of life. The writing life anyway.            Ifone is muleheaded enough, a story can be bulled through without outlining. Evenfairly long stories. It's kind of a masochistic exercise though. It may taketwenty, even thirty rewrites to get a decent story that way.            Don'task me how I know this. I'll begin crying. I'll have to. My wife knows I recallexperiences like this and keeps all the sharp instruments locked up.            Novelsare the worst experience in the world without an outline. After you spendseveral years learning to juggle thousands of details in your head - you canget pretty good at it - you can write longer and longer material. Except, thatno matter how good you get at retaining all this stuff in your head, you'llprobably end up stuck on about page ninety. That seems to be the magic lengthfor novels. Not quite long enough by about threee hundred pages. Short storiesseem to peter out around between pages six to eight.            Ifyou've got an outline you just don't have these problems. Stuck? Glance up atyour outline and instantly you'll be reminded where you are in the story andyour perspective will return. The dizzy feeling will recede.            Okay.Sales pitch for outlines over. I learned my technique from taking screenplaywriting classes. Those guys always outline. That's how they can writescripts so quickly. I took a class in this program with Martin Goldstein and Iwrote a 108-page script in two days. And Mr. Goldstein says it's a great script- has attached himself to it as the producer and not only that - this\"two-day\" script was just named a semifinalist in the Academy Foundation'sNicholl’s Fellowships in Screenwriting awards. Not bad for two days work! Iwrote the first 64 pages in about eight hours and the remaining 44 pages inabout ten hours. Piece of cake. Of course, I spent about a week and a half onthe outline. I do write quickly, so don't use my times as a model. Without anoutline, I'd still be writing...            Let'sget to these puppies. Here's how you create an outline for your story. Ready?            1.You make notes to yourself as you imagine the story played out.            2.You arrange those notes.            3.As the writing proceeds, you refer to them.            That'sit.            There'sa bit more to it, but really, that's 90% of outlining. First, you have toremember that a short story or a novel is drama. Knowing that, know alsothat nothing destroys drama more than logic. The dramatic story, because itspurpose is to represent life (not mirror it), is not logical at all. It is,instead, psychological, and the outline must match this. It must be acomplication-resolution outline. That's the way stories are written.            Theoutline I propose you try consists of five simple statements that describe themajor actions through which the story will be told. One statement for eachmajor focus. And each statement will be short, consisting only of two to threewords. A human noun, a strong, concrete action verb, and (most of thetime) a direct object. (We won't count articles such as \"a\",\"an\", and \"the\" as words.) The simpler an outline is themore it focuses on the important relationships in your story. Words actuallycount for more in an outline than in the story. An outline like I'm proposingwill probably have no more than fifteen words in it. In a story, thealmost-right word can sometimes suffice, but in an outline, it has to be theperfect word. Another difference between this version of an outline and theones Missus Grundy had you do is that the statements in her outlinesrepresented topic sentences and as such specify what comes at the beginningof the section they represent. That's because in logical writing, thewriter states her premise first and then develops it.            Indramatic stories, however, the dramatic action that makes your point comes atthe end of each section - where climaxes belong. What this means is thatyour outline statements represent endings, not beginnings. This is an importantpoint to keep in mind.            I'mgoing to use my own story I Shoulda Seen a Credit Arranger in mycollection titled \"Monday's Meal\" to illustrate a typical outline. Ialso wrote a novel with the same story as well as a screenplay, both titled THEGENUINE, IMITATION, PLASTIC KIDNAPPING. The same outline for all three forms. Thefirst statement will be:            Complicationor inciting incident:                        Debtendangers Pete (This is the complication that provides the occasion for thestory. Every story must have an inciting incident to kick-start it. Somethingmust happen that changes the protagonist's world and by doing so, creates a problem/goal.This is where stories must begin - not with setting or backstory. Act I, as itwere.)            Development:(This is the second part of the outline. The development steps that lead to theresolution. Act II, as it were, following Aristotle's Poetics)                        1.Peteagrees to kidnapping                        2.Pete and Tommy botch kidnapping                        3.Pete escapes            Resolution:(This is the third and final step. Act III.)                        Peteloses everything but matures            Thiscame to sixteen words, two over the optimim. (Remember, we don’t count articlesas words in this exercise.) If you're under twenty, you're fine. Once I havethis outline, the rest is just filling in the blanks. But, everything in thestory must contribute to the outline. I can't, for instance, begin the story bytalking about Pete's childhood in New Orleans, for example.            Now.Look at the elements. There's each of the three things I said should be in theoutline. A human noun, a strong, concrete action verb, and a directobject. I didn't, for instance, say \"Pete is in debt\" for mycomplication. Why? Because is is a static verb. Always think instraightforward active terms.            Youmight also notice I didn't have a happy-sappy \"Hollywood\" ending.Those don't work in literature. They work (I guess) in direct-to-video movies(and more than a few that we see at the theater) and in self-published novels,but not in quality fiction, and that's what we're interested in here, I assume.A good ending has both a win and a loss for the protagonist.            Doesn'tlook much like Missus Grundy's Roman numeral outline, does it? But, if you readthe story and then compare it to the outline, you'll see it's all there. And itallows for you to roam and be creative within the story. You just have toremain within the strictures of the outline. But, there's a heck of a lot offreedom there! I have three forms of this story—a short story, a novel, and ascreenplay which was a finalist in the Nicholl’s Awards. I used the sameoutline for all three forms, which were all different in length and inmaterial.            Whatthis kind of outline does is force you to think through the story before youwrite it. You spot problems before you waste two hundred or two thousand (ormore) words on them. Suddenly, writing becomes a breeze. It really does.            Inthe story above, the definition of a story is adhered to. A story consists of acharacter in trouble - has a need, wants something, etc. A story alwaysbegins with the inciting incident--whatever happens to drastically change theprotagonist's world and create a problem for him or her (it has to be thebiggest problem in his/her life at that point and one the reader will deemworthy enough to follow him in solving it, reaching his/her goal). Pete's introuble--he owes a lot of money to a nasty bookie who has just issued him an ultimatum.He has to do something about it. He does get tricked by Tommy into an ill-fatedkidnapping, but once he's in it, he begins to take his own action. You can havecoincidence or fate in a story, but it should never be a coincidence that helpsthe main character. It can appear at first to do so, but it never really can.It must always hinder the character. And stories are drama, which meansyou must create scenes, not wander around inside the head of the character, andscenes are by definition, action. There must be dramatic action. Also, aprotagonist may be reactive at first to the inciting incident, but very quicklyhe or she must become proactive, acting on his or her own behalf to solve theproblem, gain the goal, etc. Reactive characters (characters to whom things\"happen\" in which they spend their time on stage reacting to thosethings) are boring and don't belong in good fiction. That represents episodicstories and there’s no market for those. And lastly, because of an actionthe protagonist takes, there must come a reversal and a change in thecharacter. What Joyce called an \"epiphany.” Characters in fiction, must,as a result of the actions of the story, become profoundly changed from theperson they were at the beginning of the story. Also, the character can't justthink through the problem, although obviously, that can be a part of hisepiphany, but it has to be occasioned by an action that he can then processinternally. The epiphany also cannot be attained through a conversation withanother character. There has to be an actual action which changes him and turnsthe story. Once that happens, the story is over. Get out. Start a new story.But first create an outline for it. You'll thank yourself.            Onceyou've created an outline, it's almost impossible to stray in the wrongdirection. If you find yourself doing that, just glance at the outline and getback on the right road. If the story takes a turn you didn’t expect and thatyou feel will make a better story, no problem. Simply take a few minutes andcreate a new outline. You’ll be glad you did.            Forthe first week, part of your assignment is to create an outline for your story,using the example above. No more than twenty words. Use human nouns, strongaction verbs and a direct object (direct object optional). Then, begin yourstory, following the outline (which means to begin with the inciting incidentand that written as a scene). Send us 2-5 pages of the story.Can’t wait to see your work!Blue skies,LesPROPER FORMAT            It’s extremely important to followproper formatting whenever you’re presenting work to a professional. A writermay be the rankest beginner in the world and have a long way to go beforeproducing publishable quality work, but there’s simply no excuse for not atleast looking professional. Work presented with improper formatting is thefirst thing that will force the teacher, editor, agent or any professional todismiss the writing. The thing is, it’s extremely easy to use proper formattingthat follows accepted usages by professionals, so there’s really no reason notto employ it, right?It’svery simple. Here are the basic rules:1.Double-space. Manuscripts are always double-spaced. One of the reasons is, it’seasier for the people who read millions of words each year to read work thathas plenty of white space. It also leaves room for editors to make comments onthe mss itself. Finally, it tells the reader how many words are in the mss.2.Margins. All four margins should be set at at least 1 inch. This is usually thedefault setting of most word processing programs. This creates attractive whitespace, gives the editor a clear idea of how many words are in the mss, andleaves room for notations.3.Font. It used to be that there were two acceptable fonts, Courier New and TimesNew Roman. Both set at 12 pt. While there are still a few publishers who willaccept Courier New, most now insist on TNR. (Plus, CN is one ugly font!). Thereare several logical reasons for this. One, again—along with the proper margins,and line spacing, by using TNR set at 12 pts, this instantly tells the editorhow many words are in the document. For those who think they look at computerword counts… wrong-o! Those are notoriously wrong for editor’s purposes. In fact,never put a word count or an estimated word count on the mss—it’s a sure signthat here’s an amateur at work. (Same with copyright symbols.). Different fontswill deliver differing numbers of words per page. TNR tells the editor thatthere will be an average of 250 words per page. They can instantly look at pagecount and know how many words there are in the entire mss. And, this isimportant! All editors have space requirements for their publications, whetherit’s a short story magazine or a novel publisher. They need to know up fronthow many words are in the mss as the first requirement in their decision topublish or not.Often,the writer still using Courier New is a screenwriter and that’s the only fontallowed in screenplays. That writer is used to it and it feels and lookscomfortable and most know that it’s one of the two fonts stated as allowable infiction, so they use it. While it’s still technically okay to use it, I’dstrongly urge even the screenwriters not to use it in their fiction. More andmore publishers are stating they don’t want to see work in it any longer.Theprimary reason editors insist on a particular font however, is simply becauseof the amount of reading they do in their job. Many fonts are extremely hard onthe eyes and create headaches and eyestrain. The culprit usually is the serifsin some fonts. Serifs are those descenders in the letters y, g, j, p, q. In many fonts, the descenders are truncated andstubby, causing the eye to kind of “bump along” when reading the text. Thiscauses eyestrain and even severe headaches to professionals who read all daylong. The descenders in TNR are long and reading work in that font allows theeye to travel smoothly, avoiding those problems. Makes sense, eh?4.Unjustified right margins. Do not send in work with justified right margins!It’s the job of the editor to create a justified margin for print—not theauthor’s. Again, a mss with justified margins throws off accurate word counts.Plus, it’s a sure sign of an amateur at work and you don’t want to ever givethat impression.5.One space between sentences. About 40-50 years ago, it was proper to use twospaces between sentences. That was in the typewriter days. Since computers cameon the scene, it’s now one space. The kernaling is different forcomputer-generated material than it is for typewriters. This is a glaringamateur mistake and all editors cringe when they see a mss with two spacesbetween sentences. (And, it’s easy to spot.) This signals strongly that this isa writer who hasn’t kept up with current usages. A writer who hasn’t learnedthat two spaces between sentences went away many decades ago, is going to beassumed to be a writer who hasn’t kept up with the even more importantconventions of fiction and his/her work is probably going to receive shortshrift when encountered. Remember, even if you are a beginner, there’s noreason to look like one! Strive always to appear professional even if youhaven’t yet published. It shows respect for both the professional you’resubmitting to and it also shows respect for yourself and your work.6.No bolding in manuscripts.7.No underlining in manuscripts. Back before computers, underliningindicated to the typesetter that the underlined material was to be set initalics. Well, today we have… italics…right on our ‘puters, so you simply use… italics.8.No ALL CAPS for emphasis. This is considered email language and isn’tacceptable. Use italics to show emphasis. This is slowly changing as younger,less well-educated (okay, so that was my own editorial comment…) editors comeinto the picture and grew up with email language. But, use it at your ownperil, for if your work comes before a traditionalist, which it likely will, ared flag will go up and you don’t want that.9.Mark space breaks. The accepted method is to mark them with stars, centered.Like***this…Space breaks are only used to signal significant changes in the narrative, suchas a major break in time or a pov change. One mistake I see commonly is thatwriters provide extra spaces before and after the space break. Like***this…There aren’t any extra line spaces. When you finish the material to beseparated, simply hit “Enter,” center the stars, and hit Enter and begin typingthe next paragraph. It’s very important to mark space breaks since if you don’t,during ensuing edits, an unmarked break can easily “disappear” if it ends up atthe top or bottom of a page. Even if that doesn’t happen in your own copy,since today we usually send electronic files of our work to editors, they’lloften work on it and it can disappear for them since it wasn’t marked.Oneusage is totally verboten! The practice seen sometimes of separating eachparagraph by a space break. The famous writer Lorrie Moore began using this asher stylistic “footprint” and that means that now no one else can do the sameor else they’ll come across as imitative or derivative of Ms. Moore. Just likeone can’t use no caps, ala e.e. cummings, or else be viewed as unimaginativeand basically a bad copycat. Although, Charles Bukowski exchewed capitalizationin much of his work and no one accused him of copyitis, but then perhaps they’dseen the movie Barfly and just didn’twant to anger him…Someebooks are formatted lazily or incorrectly and you’ll see paragraphs separatedlike this and it drives me nuts! Just sloppiness on the part of the publisher.It’s fine in a blog or a handout like this, but not in fiction.10.Don’t use drop caps or other stylistic elements you see in printed work. Theseare editor’s choices and not the author’s. Don’t try to imitate what you see inpublished work. Simply create documents according to the guidelines set outhere. I’ve had writers send me work where the first three or four words were inall caps, and I asked them what in the heck were they thinking and they saidthey’d seen a novel that way in the bookstore. They didn’t understand that’s aneditor’s purview and never the writer’s. Don’t make those amateurish mistakes!11.There are some usages you may not be aware of that have changed. For a big one,today there are two punctuations that are frowned upon in fiction. Colons andsemicolons. These days, they’re considered archaic punctuations. That’s becausefiction is becoming more and more informal and colons and semicolons are fairlyformal punctuations—especially colons. They have the effect of slightlyinterrupting the fictive dream by drawing attention to themselves. Today, weuse the em dash instead. It’s less formal and therefore less intrusive on theread. About the only people still using colons and semicolons (an occasionalsemicolon is still okay), are brand names, some journalists, and writers from adifferent culture (such as Canadians, for example). And, older writers whohaven’t kept up with current usages. They’re still used in nonfiction writing—justnot in fiction much these days. Many times people resist these changes. It’soften difficult to change. But, a professional writer has to adapt. We work inthe English language, which is a living, mutating language and things changeconstantly. It’s to our benefit to keep up with those changes and be able toadapt. 12.Multiple punctuations. As a rule (there are exceptions) it’s consideredamateurish to use multiple punctuation, such as more than one exclamation pointfor emphasis—like this!!!! Or, to use two different ending punctuations, likethis!? They’re considered “cutesy” and too precious to be believed… Although,there are occasionally exceptions to this.13.Other punctuations. An ellipsis in dialog signals a pause or a trailing off inthe speech. An em dash ending dialog signals an interruption in the speech,usually by another speaker.Thereare a few other usages but I’ll wait to point them out as and if they occur.Hope this helps! The main point is to always submit your work in a professionalformat. Please. It shows you respect your work as well as the reader and thatinvites the professional to respect it also.Blueskies,LesAvailable for preorder--Comes out November 17."},

When I went to Amazon's site, I discovered it had been taken down. No reason given. I contacted my publisher, Down & Out Books, and they were unaware of this. After several days, they told me they'd talked to Amazon and it was reinstated, but Amazon claimed not to know why it had been taken down, that it was just kind of a \"mistake.\" But, all the presales were gone.

But it wasn’t until reading his memoir that I realized theextent to which he lived the things he wrote about. Adrenaline Junkie is atonce heartbreaking, as it is funny, and just plain sick. I worked up a sweatreading it. It’s sort of like a witnessing a plane crash. You don’t really wantto look at the carnage, but you can’t help but stare.

{"title": "CHEF GORDON RAMSEY'S WRITING CLASSES", "date": "Friday, July 27, 2018", "text": "(This is a rerun, but thought it might be helpful to anyone who hadn't read it originally.)Hi folks,What? You didn’t realizeChef Gordon Ramsey taught writing? The fact is, he’s one of the best writingteachers in the world.He disguises it by claimingto reach cooking, but if you understand the code he’s using in hispresentations on his show, KITCHEN NIGHTMARES, it’s all about writing.Actually, it’s about anyart form. The rules are pretty much the same, whether it’s in cooking,painting, writing, sculpting or music or anything else in the art world.Let’s take a look at hisshows and see how that works, okay?First, what’s almost alwaysthe chief reason the restaurant he’s called in to help out is failing? Whilethere are a variety of problems, without fail the primary one is that the foodthe restaurant is serving sucks. Let’s look at that one first and see how itrelates to writing.When he walks into afailing restaurant, the very first thing he does is order a meal. The food hewants to look at and taste is the same as the writing teacher looking at thestudent’s manuscript. To paraphrase a famous Presidential slogan: “It’s thefood, stupid.” Or, in our case as writers: “It’s the writing, stupid.”The quality of the food isthe single biggest obstacle to success for any restaurant. The quality of thewriting is the single biggest obstacle to success for any author.See where we’re going? Seehow the comparison starts to make sense?He begins with the foodbecause the truth is, if the food’s good, just about everything else can bewrong and the restaurant still has a chance of succeeding. Conversely, ifeverything else is perfect—the service, the décor, the location, et al—but thefood sucks—all the restaurant owner is going to have is a place that has agreat waitstaff, an amazing décor, a prime location… and stands largely emptywith those talented waiters and waitresses standing around picking their noses….It’s the same with writing.The manuscript can be perfectly presented with proper formatting and deliveredto the right gatekeepers—agents/publishers—but if the writing sucks, it won’tmatter. Two bites into the mss “meal” and if it doesn’t taste good, it’s headedfor the circular file, just like the food Ramsey sends back on that initialtasting is headed for the same circular file. What us literary types refer toas being “shitcanned.”What are the responses ofthe restaurant owners and chefs when Ramsey tells them their food sucks? It’spredictable. Most are in denial. Most are in way-huge denial. Almost to aperson, they feel their food is amazing. They’re convinced that the reasonsthey’re not rich yet is something else other than the food. The usual responsebefore he delivers his judgment on their menu is that he’ll come in, deliver afew “secrets” that will get them on their way to becoming a four-starestablishment. Does this remind you of anything? A new writer in your class orwriter’s group, perhaps? Who, before the critique begins is clearly there toglean a few “inside” writing or publishing tips so they can be on their way tothe bestseller lists or at least to be signed by an agent or sell their novel?Look at the responses hegets when he tells them he wouldn’t serve their food to a dog. Many (most?) getangry. It never dawned on them that they couldn’t cook well. In their minds, itwas always something else that prevented them from achieving a sold-outrestaurant every night. How dare Gordon criticize their work! See anycorrelation to a writer receiving criticism from a teacher or agent or editoror the writer’s group?The writer who is alsorighteously irate, thinks about all those people who told him his writing was“better than Joyce Carol Oates.” Folks like his family, his friends, thefriendly faces in his writing group, his English teacher, his workmates. Howcould they all be wrong and this pretender (teacher/agent/editor) have such adifferent opinion? Maybe it’s because… this teacher isn’t connected to thememotionally and only judges the product? And has higher standards? A betterknowledge of what good writing consists of? And a version of Hemingway’s“built-in bullshit detector?” Maybe…There’s a superciliousteaching “method” some schools and venues want their writing teachers to adhereto, called by some the “sandwich” method. Start with a piece of praise bread,slip in a bit of criticism, and then finish it off with another piece of praisebread. Does this strike anyone else as perhaps a great example ofmollycoddling? Of treating writers less than adults? Schools do this for tworeasons. One, they want return customers (students). People who are toldbluntly that their work is bad often don’t return. Especially when there areplenty of places who will tell them they’re great. Two, they’ve bought intothis New Agey crap where teachers aren’t supposed to let their little chargesknow that among them are winners and losers. (Kind of like real life…) It’s themindset that awards “participation trophies” and bullshit like that. Like theschool recently in the news that cancelled their annual Honor Days because the oneswho didn’t achieve that level would “feel bad.” Well… so frickin’ what… When doyou suppose that kids are going to learn that some people are smarter thanothers, some have gifts others don’t share, some just work harder, and thereare even some folks who are smarter, more gifted and also work harder? Thatjust seems more of an USSR attitude than an American one, but I may feel thatway just because I’m not up on my Karl Marx reading… And don’t plan to be…That “sandwich” method ofteaching. Two pieces of praise, one piece of criticism. That kind of impliesthat everybody has two great things they’re doing in writing and only one bad.My experience is that often it’s the reverse ratio and I’ve had more than onebeginning writer in class who did nine bad things and only one good one. The“good one” was showing up on time and that was about it. If that’s the case,then I guess the teacher should make up things to praise them about. Wouldn’tthat devalue honest praise? I mean, if a person is terrible at writing dialogand you’re out of praiseworthy pieces of bread, should I tell him the only onewriting better dialog these days is Elmore Leonard?Can you imagine Gordonwalking into a restaurant and telling them, “Well, the third waitress on theleft is doing a great job. The food is atrocious. The bartender served me aperfect Gibson.” Don’t think so. My guess is that Gordon wasn’t lucky enough tohave gone to a contemporary American public school… Poor guy. He probably wentto a school that was still in the real world. That’s kind of tragic… Wonder howhe worked through all those negative things he must have had said to him…There’s a reason writersdon’t have a writer’s union. Well, not one that many people belong to, anyway.It’s because most of us know you succeed by merit and hard work. Anorganization that’s predicated on the concept of “more money for less work andfewer hours at the expense of others” just isn’t suited for our temperaments asa rule.Okay. I’m off my soapboxnow…Another correlation Ramseyhas with good writing instruction is that he doesn’t differentiate betweenkinds or even levels of restaurants. He puts as much work into correcting aneighborhood bar and grill in a Midwestern town as he does a pricey Frenchrestaurant in NYC. He doesn’t try to make the neighborhood restaurant into theFrench restaurant or vice versa. No such thing as “literary” restaurants and“genre” restaurants. The only commonality in his mind is that they be the bestthey can be within their parameters. He knows what constitutes great pub foodjust as he knows what great Japanese or Italian cuisines requires. Whether it’sa hamburger he’s creating or a soufflé, it’s all about the quality of theindividual dish. He thinks like Nabokov who said he didn’t acknowledge anygenres other than “good writing and bad writing.”He also insists the menu becontemporary. That dated dishes, even when prepared well, aren’t going to drawdiners. The same thing exists in literature. The writer who insists on creatingstories considered archaic or out of fashion, even if written well (within thestandards of that day) aren’t going to draw many readers. A writer whoabsolutely loves the “Dear Reader” style of Victorian literature may write asimilar book, but it just isn’t going to sell, any more than an epistolarynovel ala Samuel Richardson’s “Pamela” is going to be crowding anyone off theshelves at B&N. Time and again, Gordon encounters these dinosaurs who aretrapped in the past and spends days trying to dissuade them of the value oftheir effort.Watch his shows and see howoften he tells his charges to keep it simple, use fresh ingredients and don’tovercomplicate the recipes. Sounds kind of like Hemingway and Carver, doesn’tit? Or any number of brilliant writers. The first precept I give writers isthat one of the biggest keys to becoming a good writer is to pay attention totwo things: Make it clear and make it interesting. Kind of what Gordon saysabout good cooking…There are no synonyms forthe following words in either cooking or in writing:1. Bad2. Stupid3.Crap4. DullThey state plainly whatthey mean. There are words that mean the opposite and if a writer works hardenough and pays attention, they can change those descriptions of their writingto:1. Good2. Intelligent3. Entertaining4. Brilliant… but to change those wordsto the positive ones takes hard work, not unearned, empty words of praise. Justabout every writer starts out with the former words as being accuratelydescriptive of their writing. That’s no sin. What’s a sin is believing whenpeople tell you it’s the latter that describe the work when it doesn’t. Whenyour writing is consistently praised, I’d turn on the b.s. detector and trustit’s in working order.Watch Gordon Ramsey when heturns around a failing restaurant and imagine he’s instructing you as a writer.The lessons he imparts are exactly the same.Hope this helps your ownwriting! BTW, we have a new session of our online writing class beginning on Aug. 5 that has a couple of openings. Our class uses the same principles as Mr. Ramsey does in his... If interested, give me a yell at butchedgerton@comcast.net and I'll be happy to answer any and all questions.Blue skies,LesMe and several of our classmates in Scottsdale, AZ"},

{"title": "NEW CLASS SESSION TO BEGIN - TAKING NEW STUDENTS", "date": "Wednesday, July 18, 2018", "text": "Hifolks,Well,we’re just finishing up our final week on the current session of my onlinenovel-writing class, “Les Edgerton’s Bootcamp for Writers,” and find ourselvesa couple of openings. Our next session will begin on Aug 5 and consists of aten-week session, with the probability of taking a week off sometime during theterm to recharge batteries.Thisis a call for new class members. Not sure how many openings we’ll have as weoffer vacancies first to our auditors.Thebasics are the course costs $400 and it’s limited to ten people. The $400 isnonrefundable, as if a person quits during the session it would be impossibleto fill that vacancy. As this is my primary source of income, it would bedetrimental for myself and my family. It’s very rare that anyone opts out oncebegun, however. In over five years, there have only been three.We’vehad a remarkable history of success. Nearly three dozen writers over the pastten years who has become a part of our class or whom I’ve coached privately hasgone on to being legitimately published and/or secured a good literary agent.In fact, that is our only goal—to become legitimately published.I try to warn people who arethinking of joining us, how tough the class is, but I know from past experiencethat even so forewarned, at least some are going to be in for a shock when theysee that we really don’t hold hands, pat people on the back for minimumefforts, or overlook writing that doesn’t work. I’m not cruel (at least I don’tthink so) nor are any of the oldtimers in class, but most new folks haven’tbeen exposed to a class like ours. The truth is, most writers who haven’t had aclass like ours have been praised in other classes or most likely, have been inclasses that use the “sandwich” method of teaching. You know—that deal wherethe teach applies a bit of praise, then a bit of criticism, and then a bit ofpraise. Well, that ain’t our shtick. Not even close. The comments we allprovide on everyone’s work fit one definition only. They’re honest.This isn’t to be mean or to act likewe’re the only folks around who know what good writing is. Except… we do. I’mnot aware of any other class out there with the kind of track record oursenjoys. Virtually every writer who stays the course with us ends up with a topagent and/or a book deal. That doesn’t happen in a single ten-week session.About the earliest anyone has earned an agent or book deal in our class hasbeen about a year. And, that’s reasonable.The thing is, our writers don’texpect things to be easy.Ifigured I’d let some of the class members give you their take on our class.They don’t hold back and they all have tough skins. They will all tell you thesame thing. It isn’t a class for sissies or for those who need their hands heldor lots of pats on the back. Becoming published is hard, hard work and isn’t anundertaking for sissies. To get there, our students know they have to put ontheir Big Boy and Big Girl pants and expect to work harder than they ever havein their lives—and to never, ever “settle” their standards of excellence.From a student several years ago:Hi ________. Since Les opened thefloor for comments from the \"class veterans\" I'm chipping in with mytwo cents. I have a file cabinet filled with stuff I sent Les and then neededasbestos gloves to take the paper off the printer. When I started this journey,I'd never taken an English class past high school. (I was pre-med in college) Ifigured I love to read, so how hard can it be? Okay, quit laughing at me.Clearly, when I wrote my first version of my first novel, I had no idea aboutstory structure, POV, any of that. I figured I'm pretty articulate andtherefore I can write?Les quickly set me straight. All ofthis is to point out that we've all been on the receiving end of Les' brutalhonesty. I will find some of the comments he made on my work and post them butphrases like \"throwing up in my mouth now\" and \"bury this sodeep in the yard no one ever finds it\" are seared into my brain and Idon't have to look to find those!!! The point is, I took other classes before Imet Les and the teachers were kind and gentle and never told me I sucked. If itweren't for Les, I'd still be churning out awful drivel that makes people wantto throw up instead of trying not to throw up while I wait to see if my agentis able to sell my book. I would never have gotten an agent without Les. Sohang in there. Listen to everything he says and if it doesn't make sense, askaway.From another student:The novel that I am currently tryingto sell has been a work in progress for several years. The first time Les sawit he sent it back and told me to re-write the WHOLE thing!!! My character wasa wimp. She sat back and let things happen to her. I argued a little, rewrote alittle and then moved on to another book. After a year, I went back and rereadit and saw the truth. It was awful. So I took a deep breath and started over.Page one. First sentence. Re-wrote the entire thing. It took a full year andthen I revised it again. It's definitely a process. But once you get the incitingincident and the outline steps down pat, it's a whole lot easier. Trust me!!!And you'll never graduate completely. A few months ago, Les and I wenthead-to-head on one single passage. I was trying to be lazy and take the easyway out. He called me on it and I resubmitted three or four weeks in a row,revisions on the same passage. I was sure my classmates were so sick of it theywere going to stick needles in their eyes rather than read it again! But in theend, the passage rocked!! So hang in there!!!! It'll get better. (Note: Thisnovel sold and the writer is currently working on her fifth novel.)Classmembers come from all over the globe. We’ve had students from the UK, Ireland,Taiwan, Spain, all parts of the U.S., Canada, Australia, Luxembourg and manyother places. We work with writers in virtually every genre on the bookshelves.Theway class works is that the class is divided into two equal groups. We used tohave just one group, but it got to be too much for many students. In the past,everybody in the class was required to read everybody else’s work each week andprovide in-depth comments on everyone’s work. That meant they had to read nineother class members’ work and deliver intelligent commentary on each one. We’vesince evolved to a more manageable number where now each class member reads anddelivers comments on just four other classmates’ work. I provide comments oneverybody’s work and that’s why the class is limited to only ten. With tenwriters, I can give each person the quality of time and analysis each deserves.Eachweek begins on Sunday evening, when people can begin submitting their weeklypages from Sunday until Thursday. If it’s a new writer to the class, they areallowed to submit their first five pages of their novel, plus an outline whichconsists of five statements and a total of 15-20 words. Oldtimers in class callthis “inciting incident hell.” If the outline isn’t working and their beginningdoesn’t represent the inciting incident as provided in their outline, they arerequired to keep submitting each week until it does. Our feeling is if theyhaven’t thought through their novels sufficiently and provided a publishablenovel structure (evidenced by the outline), then they most likely don’t have anovel ready to be written and to simply plunge ahead will almost invariablylead to an unfinished novel. We don’t want that.Oncethey’ve been okayed for the beginning, from thereafter they can submit up toeight pages per week, along with the others in class.Timezones don’t matter. Everybody’s work, including everyone’s comments and my owncomments on each person’s work each week is posted on the class site and folkscan go to it any time of the day or night. Class members can begin sending backtheir comments on each others’ in their group from Sunday through the followingSunday, when it begins again. Although, in practicality, most members send intheir work each week on Wednesdays and Thursdays. It’s like being in an“on-ground” class in that everything said or done in class is seen byeverybody.Wedo have a chat function and people use it all the time, even though they’re indifferent time zones. One of the best things about this class is that we havelots of oldtimers who know from their own experience what works in a novel andwhat doesn’t and more importantly… whyit works or doesn’t work. It’s like having a group of seven or eight otherprofessionals helping you with your own novel. Probably at any given time inclass, there will be four or five who already have had a novel or severalpublished as a result of being in class, so it’s a really rarified group. And,if you think that you couldn’t operate in a situation like this because you’rea beginner, that simply isn’t the case here at all. Nearly every single personin each class began just the way you did, as a rank beginner. And, theyremember and they have complete empathy for your situation, if you’re abeginning writer.It’snot a situation of simply saying, “This doesn’t work.” Myself and others in classwill surely say that, but we then let you know why it didn’t work and give yousolid suggestions on how to make it work. We collectively have a nurturingnature and all of us want the newcomer to succeed just about as badly as thatwriter wants to.Ifyou are still interested but still feel intimidated, I think if you simply lookat how the class works, you’ll quickly see how you’ll fit in comfortably. Sincewe’ve got a couple of weeks left in class, for anyone who would like to see upclose and personal how we work as a class, I’d be delighted to give you auditorstatus for our last week. Besides class members, we also have an auditorfunction which works the same as it does in a “regular” college class. You’readmitted to class and can view every single thing we’re doing and the entireclass session is archived and easy to access. Normally, the cost of auditingthe class is $50, but for our last week, for those interested in simply gettinga look at how we work, just email me at butchedgerton@comcast.net and letme know and I’ll have our class administrator, Holly, get you on board asap.Iknow there are no doubt a lot of questions you may have. Please feel free tocontact me at any time and ask me anything you’d like.Frompast experience, when we’ve had openings like this, they go quickly, so if youare interested, please get in touch, okay?Forthose interested in such things, here are a few of my own qualifications toteach writing.MFAin Writing from Vermont CollegeTaughtwriting for the UCLA Writer’s ProgramTaughtwriting via Skype for the New York Writer’s WorkshopWriter-in-Residencefor three years for the University of ToledoWriter-in-Residencefor one year for Trine UniversityTaughtwriting classes for St. Francis UniversityTaughtwriting classes for Phoenix CollegeTaughtwriting for Writer’s Digest Online ClassesTaughtwriting classes for Vermont CollegePublished20 books, including craft books on writing, novels, sports books, YA novel, historicalnonfiction book, humor nonfiction, black comedy novel, noir, thrillers,literary and existential fiction.Dozensof short stories published in such publications as The South Carolina Review,High Plains Literary Review, Aethlon, Flatmancrooked, Murdaland, Best AmericanMystery Stories and many others.Alot of living… much of it as an outlaw…Blueskies,LesSome of our classmates meet up in Denver"},

For the most part, the narrators are observers, some closer to theaction than others. It’s a marvellous storytelling technique. We have a child,a couple of prisoners, an accomplice to a crazy crime, a desperate starvingmother, the client of a dancer, and one airhead young woman, to mention just afew. The stories in this collection reminded me strongly of the work ofFlannery O’Connor – the same insights into life’s little tragedies, the sameprecision of presentation. I like to think that O’Connor’s work could bedescribed as a string quartet. Edgerton’s is a brass band. A New Orleans jazzband, playing at full volume!

That’s exactly what just happened to thishappy camper.My Italian amigo, Mauro Falciani, owner of the MuchoMojo Club in Italy has been a fan of my work for several years. He owns one ofthe coolest independent bookstores in Europe.

{"title": "MONDAY'S MEAL IS OUT!", "date": "Monday, April 23, 2018", "text": "Hi folks,My first collection of short stories, Monday's Meal, was released in ebook format today from the good folks at Down and Out Press. It was originally published as a paperback by the University of North Texas Press and was nominated for the Violet Crown Book Award. This is the writing I'm the proudest of. It received rave reviews by such as the NT Times,Texas Monthly, Publisher's Weekly, the School Library Journal,  and by such august literary organizations as Studies in Short Fiction. Some of the brightest literary writers gave it their thumbs-up.Amazon linkTwo of the stories were written when I was 12 and 13. At 12 I wrote, \"Hard Times\" and a year later, I lay on my couch and wrote \"Broken Seashells.\" Most of the other stories were written before I was 21. Currently, at the behest of my agent, Svetlana Pironko, who urged me to expand \"Hard Times\" into a novel (which I'm doing) and who told me the story has \"haunted her\" since she read it and said that if I wrote it well, it could rival NO COUNTRY FOR OLD MEN.The story, \"I Shoulda Seen a Credit Arranger\" which appeared in the South Carolina Review, was later expanded into my novel titled THE GENUINE, IMITATION, PLASTIC KIDNAPPING and also the screenplay of the same title which placed as a Finalist in both the Writer's Guild and the Best of Austin competitions.And THE MOCKINGBIRD CAFE and another story not in this collection, IN THE ZONE, were both published by the august litmag, High Plains Literary Review, whose editor, Dr. Robert O. Greer, told me several years later that he assumed I was a black writer (Dr. Greer is a black man) and was very surprised to discover I was white. That was quite a complement!I'm  very proud that these stories represent a myriad of voices, including a black man, a woman, a deranged prison inmate and many other personas. I think if you didn't see a single name on this collection, you'd just assume it was a collection of a number of writers. I really don't see many contemporary writers capable of doing this and that gives me a lot of pride.I hope that this book will be exposed to an entirely new generation and that they find it compelling.If you do read it and enjoy it, please consider leaving a review on Amazon. That's the single best thing anyone can do to help out a writer.Here's what others had to say about MM: ReviewsFor MONDAY’SMEALThesad wives, passive or violent husbands, parolees, alcoholics and other failuresin Leslie H. Edgerton's short-story collection are pretty miserable people. Andyet misery does have its uses. Raymond Carver elevated the mournful complaintsof the disenfranchised in his work, and Edgerton makes an admirable attempt todo the same. He brings to this task an unerring ear for dialogue and asure-handed sense of place (particularly New Orleans, where many of the storiesare set). Edgerton has affection for even his most despicablecharacters—\"boring\" Robert, who pours scalding water over hissleeping wife in \"The Last Fan\"; Jake, the musician responsible forhis own daughter's death in \"The Jazz Player\"; and Tommy in 'IShoulda Seen a Credit Arranger,\" whose plan to get hold of some moneyinvolves severing the arm of a rich socialite—but he never takes the readerpast the brink of horrible fascination into a deeper understanding. In the beststory, \"My Idea of a Nice Thing,\" a woman named Raye tells us why shedrinks: \"My job. I'm a hairdresser. See, you take on all of these otherpeople's personalities and troubles and things, 10 or 12 of 'em a day, and whenthe end of the day comes, you don't know who you are anymore. It takes threedrinks just to sort yourself out again.\" Here Edgerton grants both thereader and Raye the grace of irony, and without his authorial intrusion, wefind ourselves caring about her predicament.—Denise Gess. The New YorkTimes Book Review, November 16, 1997*                                                          *                                                          *Leslie H. Edgerton's new collection fully meets John Updike's explanation ofwhy we read short stories: \"Each is a glimpse into another country: anoccasion for surprise, an excuse for wisdom, and an argument for charity.\"The country of Edgerton's stories, in geographic terms, is New Orleans and theTexas Gulf Coast. In human terms, Edgerton's territory is peopled by nightclubmusicians, cafe owners, teenage delinquents, inmates and ex-cons, the poor anduneducated, the heartless and violent, and a snooty former debutante.Monday's Meal is a busy collectionof twenty-one stories. A handful of these include recurring characters,enhancing the sense throughout the book that Edgerton is writing about acommunity rather than simply a series of individuals. The character with whomwe become best acquainted is Evan, a.k.a. Pete: \"Now Pete's not my realname, it's my middle name. Peter, actually. But when your first name's Evan,and you hang out where I do, you want to use something else.\" Evan/Petehangs out in the seedier precincts of New Orleans. In \"I Shoulda Seen aCredit Arranger\" and \"Ten Cents a Dance,\" he gets involved in,respectively, a botched kidnapping and the pursuit of an uninterestedprostitute. His ex-wife, the blueblood narrator of \"Princess,\" findsit horrific how he now \"hangs out with low-lifes, even street people.God!\" Evan/Pete, though, is a street-wise, philosophizing,get-by-as-best-you-can kind of guy who moves through a part of New Orleansnever viewed from the tour bus.Evan/Pete is an amusing character, yet not all of Edgerton's down-and-outers are. \"The Jazz Player\" portrays an angry young man desperateto release \"that intense, throbbing, terrible, last blast of pent-up furyand frustration and guilt and anguish and loss and death.\" In \"TheMockingbird Cafe,\" one of the strongest stories here for its concision, ablack prison escapee endures a white cop's tormenting of him and then sullenlywalks away. In \"Rubber Band,\" a kid just released from thereformatory, made cynical and weary of the world, anticipates his own snappingpoint. While Edgerton can sketch a city hardship scene comparable to JosephMitchell's--and several of the stories have the casualness of familiar essaysabout them--Edgerton establishes the kind of convincing, and wrenching,interiority with his characters achieved by only the most adept fictionwriters.Edgerton does not write exclusively about people living on society's fringe.Sometimes his characters--as in \"The Last Fan,\" about a dullard husband'sviolent turn, or \"Voodoo Love,\" about a yuppie couple's fallingout--are simply headed in that direction. To his credit, Edgerton aims forrange in his characters. While suspicion of identity interlopers across ethnicand gender lines is often justified, the smart writer adopts various personaein order to strive for empathy and understanding, rather than appropriation.\"My Idea of a Right Thing\" exemplifies this purpose in its strikingaccount of a woman's struggle with alcoholism and the (often) predominantlymale world of Alcoholics Anonymous. Less dramatic, though no less vivid,\"Telemarketing\" is the story of a woman dealing with an emotionallydistant husband and a pair of needy neighbors as she runs the cafe she owns andlongs to have a child.Even Edgerton's most harrowing stories, such as \"Hard Times,\"about the deadly abandonment of a woman and her children, read effortlessly.The prose throughout is vibrant and precise. At times, the author's sharp earfor colloquial mannerisms tends to turn his speakers into Runyonesquecaricatures, as when the high-brow belle in \"Princess\" exclaimsindignantly, \"Why, I'd just die!\" On the other hand, such dialectadds as much local color as references to the Camellia Cafe or beignets. A casein point: after protesting how he was \"bum-rapped on that litigious,\"the narrator of \"Dream Flyer\" gripes about the \"effrippery\"of his jailers for putting him in the same cell with an\"orignal-diginal\" like the Dream Flyer, who's scheduled to be\"exterminated for something he didn't do.\" In fiction as in life, Isuppose, better too much of a good thing than not enough.Once again, the University of North Texas Press deserves high praise for itscommitment to publishing superb contemporary fiction.

He writes with a stunning accuracy, aconvincing authority and a stark reality. At the same time, he strikes abalance between beauty, sensitivity and humor. Edgerton isn’t concerned withkeeping your interest. He wants to reach into your heart, tear it out, hold itfor you while it’s still beating!

Port Arthur News, August 2, 1998                                                          *                                                          FromLibrary JournalThis collection of short fiction by the author of The Death of Tarpons (LJ3/15/96) contains considerable variety of tone, voice, and subject matter, butthe majority of the stories fall into two distinct groups. A large number ofstories focus on troubled and deeply self-absorbed men who seem surprised tofind themselves in failed romantic relationships. These men stoically endurethe collapse of relationships they have helped destroy, and Edgerton handlesthe psychological complexities of both his male and his female protagonistsvery effectively. A number of other stories focus on marginal Pulp Fictiontypes who are haunted by personal demons and are drawn to violence. In storiesthat range in tone from the comic and farcical to the darkly tragic and grim,Edgerton draws memorable portraits of these dangerous and unpredictablecharacters. Many of the stories in this collection are set in and around NewOrleans, and Edgerton describes this milieu well. Recommended.

Edgerton(Excerpts)Monday,in the older South, was traditionally washday, and a week's worth of dirtylaundry meant a day of hard labor. Large families still had to be fed, soMonday's meals were often \"one pot\" concoctions with a little bit ofeverything, including surprise ingredients. But simmered all together Monday'smeal was frequently the best meal of the week. Thus Texas born Leslie Edgertonentitled his first collection of short stories MONDAY'S MEAL.            Edgerton's stories are a concoction,including surprise ingredients. They happen in all kinds of places: NewOrleans, Indiana, the small towns of Texas, the streets of the Big Easy, thepoverty stricken South. The people who populate the stories include both thepredictable and the unusual. For example, not this description of theprotagonist in his story \"The Bad Part of Town:\" \"He was so meanthat wherever he was standing became the bad part of town.\" Othercharacters include dance hall girls, recovering alcoholics making toughchoices, jazz players, Arnold and Amelia Critchen, victims of hard times, aspoiled Princess, or an old man gathering seashells and remembering. The castis large and varied and demanding because a reader cannot leave them withouthaving shared a bit of his own humanity and discovered a little of that allimportant inner self.            ...Edgerton's characters win a fewand lose a few.            '''The Street of Dreams. I guesswe've all been there. Historian Bonaro Overstreet in an essay \"LittleStory, What Now?\" explores the possibilities for the survival of the shortstory, a nineteenth century infant. She decides that, despite its youth, theshort story will survive well into the twenty-first century because of itsresilience, its ability to distill the experience of its time, whether insideor outside its characters and to give that experience back to readers so theysee themselves more clearly. Edgerton achieves that potential in his mixture ofstories, a rare concoction; clearly a meal which lives up to its name.—\"Writersat Work\" is heard on KTXK Stereo 91.5 FM, the Broadcast voice of TexarkanaCollege, Mondays at 6:00 PM; Wednesdays at 12:25 PM, and Fridays at 8:00 AM.                                                          *                                                          Similarsubjects and skills (reference to preceding review of Katherine L.

There are a few remaining paperback copies still available from the original publisher, the University of North Texas Press as well.I view MM as my very best work. It was my second published work of fiction and I was definitely an unknown at the time and it gave me great pride when the NY Times compared me favorably to Raymond Carver. Actually, I didn't know who Carver was at the time but learned quickly after the Times review came out. A few days before it was published, a story of mine was chosen for a Tim O'Brien workshop and during the workshop he pulled me aside and told me my work reminded him of  Ray Carver. When  the Times review came out, coupled with Tim's comment to me, I ran out and bought a copy of Carver's stories and instantly felt like I'd found a soulmate. (Actually, I didn't know who Tim O'Brien was, either. at the time, and then learned he was a big deal in the writing game...)It's being offered as a prepub sale if you just click below the cover.

Noir norHardboiled. The appropriate frame of reference is more in the direction ofhigh literature à la Dostojewski's \"Records from the cellar hole\".\"I'm going to tell my story in turn, despite the fact that you're a lotyounger than me and undoubtedly attracted to bland food, your attention spanwill be just over zero and your understanding of everything Written ones below,so I will not make it too complicated, and always one by one, so as not toconfuse you. \" (P. 8)The \"rapist\" is the direct glimpse into the head of sociopath TrumanFerris Pinter, a megalomaniac who situates himself outside the morals of hisfellow man, who believes that he is free and free to live his own rules andcontrol everything (which will turn out to be an illusion in theend). Truman: True Man? He, who believes he can live without otherpeople, is more dependent on them than he believes: to express his infamous (orpathetic) philosophy in an empty auditorium meant: to have a meaninglessphilosophy! He needs spectators, an interface to which he can express hiscontempt and arrogance. In this respect, he also makes the reader an accomplicewith the report, trying to find a sympathizer. As a reader, you have toget along first: Some sentences seem like an inexpressible truth that hasalways seemed to be self-evident, but some sentences are absolutely terribleif, for example, he declares the rape to be insignificant, because he standsmorally, intellectually, and socially above the victim. His report isneither a confession nor a description of the events that brought him on deathrow, trying not to convince innocence to assert, but is rather a kind oftestament of his self, the attempt, the self-deception in the face of his death- And in the truest sense of the word, to keep upright: whoever does not stoptalking is not dead. He: a sheherazade of death row; his report: a song ofpraise to his own perfidious morality and him, the creator of his ownworld. It states its unassailability. Will end up even apotheosis!Truman, who claims to be able to use the ability of flying as a child to growup to escape execution, simply wants to flee, but only for a brief moment toshow the law enforcement officer that only his rules and his schedule apply,that he can disappear at his own discretion and then return to die\"duly\" on the gallows. He will actually experience his bluemiracle when he finally encounters his creator in person (or at least instyle). Giving these mind games all under one roof is the great strengthof the novel. An intellectual fun and a kind of disclaimer for thereader. \"The rapist\" turns up so soon, beats the strings, swirlspresent, Past and future - away from \"objective\" stages of timeto \"subjective\", simultaneously existing levels of consciousness,that one could almost think, a strange science fiction novel around parallelworlds in the hands to hold. A novel also about revolt. Overconfidenceand - not least - realization! But also about compassion in a partlystupid, partly heartless world. With a narrative lightness and a literarydaring, as I was not allowed to read for a long time, genre boundaries are torndown, a long nose is shown to all acquaintances. An extraordinary tour deforce: ambitious, intellectually stimulating and incredibly resourceful. Aparty! So unlike most of what I have read in the field so far. Andnobody says it has to be done!Blue skies,Les"},
{"title": "Interview with Will Viharo", "date": "Wednesday, March 28, 2018", "text": "Hi folks,Just completed this interview with Will Viharo on his column, Digital Media Ghost. Click here to see it on the site.Author of the Week: Les EdgertonFiction is easier to categorize than fictionwriters, at least much of the time. Take award-winning, bestselling, universallylauded “crime writer” Les Edgerton. Designating him as such may bepromotionally correct, but it doesn’t begin to distill the essence of a manthat had led a long, complex, tormented, challenging, and ultimately rewardinglife.To pigeonhole Les Edgerton merely as a “crimewriter,” even though he writes “crime fiction,” would indeed be a crime, or atleast a misdemeanor, of intellectual laziness. An author may specialize in writing violent,hardboiled tales of desperate people doing risky things, but that doesn’t meanthe author is anything like his or her characters. Most of the time the writersare sharing their own fantasies. The readers themselves take a vicarious walkon the dark side with no danger to themselves. Kind of like a video game.Except reading requires a certain kind of mental concentration that is eludingmore and more of us as our multi-media both expands and contracts. I’ve neverplayed a single video game in my life, but I understand the emancipatingescapism of creative imagination, especially my own. For the record, though many of my books can becategorized as some version of “noir,” I’ve never considered myself a crimewriter per se. I write mostly from my own experiences, and since I’m not acriminal, at least in the legal sense, I don’t really relate to criminals. Myprotagonists are often damaged people who read too many crime novels and watchtoo many crime movies, and then try to act accordingly. And therein lies theconflict of the otherwise unconventional narratives.But don’t call me a “crime writer.” Unless, ofcourse, you consider my work an affront to society at large. The only rules Ibreak are literary in nature.Enough about me. Let’s focus on the subject ofthis interview, which is not the interviewee. Les Edgerton is a legend. Maybe not in his mind,but in mine and many, many others, whether readers or writers. He comes by thishonor not through any intentional ambitions, but incidentally, just by livinghis life, often taking the hard road instead of cruising down Easy Street. Notthat there was often an optional fork in his path, anyway.Though I’m a “straight,” at least as far as thelaw goes, I relate a lot to Les both as a person and as a writer, though ourbackgrounds are quite different. Besides artistic sublimation, we are bonded bya tenacious survival instinct, and a low tolerance for baloney. (In my case, Ieschew both the behavioral and the edible iterations).Les has plenty to say on these and othersubjects, so I’ll let him take it from here. Hang on tight: it’s going to be abumpy, grumpy, but edifying ride…You’ve sold everything from drugs to lifeinsurance in your colorful life. How do you sell yourself as an author in sucha crowded, competitive marketplace?I don’t think I’m a good one to ask this of! Idon’t seem to do that great a job in selling myself. I suspect it’s because socialmedia is fairly foreign to me and I’ve always felt out of place in it. Peoplewho pat themselves on the back or seek out praise seem a bit… what’s the un-PCword I’m looking for? Oh, yeah, kind of girlie. Most of it reminds me of “thosekids” in high school, running for class president. Working the room pretty muchlike a… what’s the word I’m looking for?... oh, yeah, like a whore. That’s kindof what social media looks like to me and I’m just uncomfortable in it. Andyet, I put more of myself out there than I can ever feel comfortable with. Ijust have a deep-seated belief that real men and women don’t wear theirfeelings on their sleeves and that seems to be a main staple of social media.So, in what will probably be an unpopular answer to your question, I’m probablynot suited very well to social media so I doubt if I’ll ever do well with itfor promotion. Plus, I think it’s maybe a bit overrated—I don’t think it movesthat many books. What moves significant numbers of books is being published bya Legacy 5 or a top independent, getting reviews in mainstream papers andmostly by being on the shelves of brick and mortar bookstores. Social mediaseems to sell to a very small audience, composed of authors in the same genreand their relatively few fans. Compared to the effort expended, I don’t see acommensurate return in sales. I suspect many of us have bought into that advicethat we need a “platform” if we want to sell books. And, crank out more andmore books, regardless of the quality.Just not interested in getting votes for PromKing…You’re been in the military and in prison, sounlike many of your peers in the noir field, you know real violence up closeand personal. How does this background inform your work as a crime fictionwriter?As an honest and knowledgeable writer. I see all these writers writingcriminals and it’s obvious most don’t have the faintest clue how the criminalmind works or how real criminals actually act. It works the same as thestraight’s mind, to be honest. Like a straight, they don’t think in terms ofgood and evil or good and bad. Whatevever they do, it’s usually for the samereasons a straight does things. (I know that the term “straight” todaysometimes means a heterosexual, but I use it the way guys in the joint use it—todescribe a person who obeys the law, i.e., a “lame.”) The way most bad guys keep getting portrayed is pretty much the wayMSNBC portrays criminals in their inside the joint series. Mainly, they showtwo-three kinds of criminals—the psychotic and the weight-lifters. The gangs.None of those guys are the norm—they’re just the guys they can sensationalize.Most are the outliers, but they’re presented as the average guy. If you couldwatch an average prison scene, you’d probably focus on the guys bench-pressingBuicks. Those aren’t the bad guys. Half of them are on steroids and half ofthem couldn’t or wouldn’t fight their way out of a paper bag. It’s mostly allfor looks and show and doesn’t scare anyone. They’re selling wolf tickets andthe only people who buy those are lames. Or, the gang-bangers. They walk aroundlike they’re breaking bad all the time and the truth is a lot of them arejokes. Or, out and out cowards. They only break bad when they outnumber others.The quiet guy on the corner of the yard, talking with one or two guys is thetrue badass in the joint. The weightlifters don’t bother him, the gangsters don’tbother him. They walk around this guy and ignore him. That’s because he’s theguy who will take them out in a New York second and they know it. But mostwriters don’t even know this guy exists. He doesn’t fit their stereotypicalideas of what a convict is or what a truly bad ass looks or acts like.There are so many books now about meth criminalsor guys who are high or drunk and are basically just mesomorphs. Yeah, thereare guys like that—more now than ever before—but there are also a substantialnumber of people involved in criminal activities who don’t look anything likethese guys and act nothing like them. A great many criminals never get caught.Look up crime statistics and it’s an eye-opener. Personally, when I finally gotcaught I’d committed well over four hundred burglaries and many other crimesfor which I never got charged. I actually got caught for two crimes. Two. Theycharged me with 82 burglaries and they didn’t have a clue about any of themother than the two they caught me in the act of. Now, any endeavor you getcaught doing two out of over four hundred, you’d kind of have to admit wassuccessful. The only way I got charged with more than those two was that I waswith other guys who also got caught and they snitched me out, telling about thejobs they’d been in on with me. The cops got lucky and actually caught me intwo actual crimes out of the more than four hundred I got away with. If copsdidn’t depend on snitches they’d never catch anyone. For crimes againstproperty that is. For some crimes—like murders and kidnappings—they have abetter rate. Although, more than half of all murders go unsolved, so…I didn’t quit committing crimes when I got out ofprison—I just quit getting caught. And that was because I acted alone. I alsodidn’t drink or do drugs on “the job.”That’s all it takes to be a successfuloutlaw. I committed over a thousand new crimes after being released and thecops didn’t even sniff what I was doing. I remember times when I left my paroleofficer’s office and went out and robbed a place. It’s really easy to be asuccessful criminal. There are so many outlaws who commit crimes constantly andnever come close to getting caught. But, straights keep on believing thisbullshit that crime doesn’t pay and eventually all criminals get caught. That’sabout as true as saying all gamblers eventually end up losing. Yeah…The other thing lacking in many writer’s work isa sense that they have a clue at all about killing or facing death. Everyonefancies themselves an expert these days and few are. In Hemingway’s day thewriters who had never faced death left that stuff to Papa—most would have beenembarrassed to portray violent death in their pages—Hemingway might have calledthem out on it. So they wrote about things like garden parties and hadcharacters named Gatsby. At which they did fine. When they wrote about thingsthey actually knew something about and had some actual talent, they looked likereal writers. Today, those kinds of writers are not afraid of being called outand they pretend to know something about facing death and while a few do, a lotdon’t. They’ve never been in the service, or a criminal, or a cop or anyone who’sfaced dying on an up-close-and-personal level. Sorry, but I can’t suspend mydisbelief for a lot of them. They give away their innocence in so many ways. Alot of them should be focusing on garden parties more, the life of insurance salesmen,and sorrowing over the lost babes of their youth…At some point in your life, in between being ahair stylist, business headhunter, sports writer, and escort servicespecialist, you were actually homeless, and then you earned a MFA in writing. Doyou feel your diverse personal and professional experiences or your formaleducation are more crucial to your literary success, or are they complementary?Is it different for everyone?I was homeless more than once, Will. Severaltimes—in New Orleans, in Baltimore, in Orange County. No big deal. Our homelessare far wealthier than the poor of most countries. I never had to miss manymeals. Too many bleeding hearts out there for that to happen. And, even ifthere weren’t, our Dumpsters hold better and more food than most of theshitholes in the world do for their regular citizens. Except maybe theDumpsters in L.A.—that’s one shithole where it looks like the homeless havecompletely taken over…As to your question, formal writing instructionnever gave me an ounce of help in writing. Just a colossal waste of money andtime. And, I went to one of the best schools in the country—Vermont College,which places in the top five every year in Poets & Writers. Ishudder to think what these Johnny-come-lately programs that have sprung upeverywhere are like. They’re just cash cows for colleges. The only one I see asbeing of value any more is Seton Hill. Not even Iowa any more. The vast numberof writers are being taught to be one-trick ponies. They just keep writing thesame tired-ass story over and over. Show me the difference between Jack Reachernovel #1 and Jack Reacher novel #18. Not ten words worth of difference. And Iread and enjoy Reacher novel, and admire Lee Child who doesn’t pretend to be awriter but is an author. Big difference.I just went through a near-death experience andmy entire outlook on life has shifted. I know now what guys like RichardBrautigan felt like. Like we’ve put our entire lives out there and no onenoticed, except superfically. Well, screw that.The real reason I think you asked about MFAs andthe like is that you understand that the vast majority of wannabe writers have(rightfully) little faith in their writing ability and are looking for a magicbean that will confer the title of writer upon them. This is the kind of thingthey’ve looked for all their lives. Go to school, earn an MBA, make a fortuneon Wall Street or in the corporate world. Get a law degree, go to med school,get a teaching degree, a degree in journalism, etc., etc. It’s all abouteducation, about a degree. Biggest load of bullshit ever sold to gullibleyouth. And, the only route to success they’re aware of. It’s fool’s gold butthey don’t know it. They don’t realize the adults in their lives have been solda crock of shit and all they can do is move it along to the next generation.Kids, listen to the truly wise among us. Listento the genius, Flannery O’Connor, who when asked if MFA programs discouragedwriters, replied, “Not enough of them.” Truer words were never spoken… Asemester studying just one of her stories (preferably without some idiot MFAadvisor whispering in their ear their own moronic interpretation of it) willlearn infinitely more about writing than sitting through a hundred academiclectures and make-work workshops. Run like the wind from MFA programs if youever want a chance to learn to write. Where it will help you is to getpublished in journals run by MFA folks, mostly an experience that feels oddlylike incest, probably because it is. It will also get your work read by acertain kind of literary agent who still puts value in these kinds of worthlessdegrees. They’ll help you become an author. Not a writer. But, I suspect themajority of folks writing today would rather be an author than a writer. Atleast, a lot of the work I see reflects that mindset.Will, to fully answer your question, for meneither my life experiences nor any formal education were crucial to myliterary ability. To my literary success, my life experiences—particularlythe ones outside the norm---were helpful, but as far as literary ability onlytwo things really helped that. First, an extraordinary intelligence (an I.Q. of163), and second, having read far, far more than anyone I know was the biggestsingle factor. I firmly believe that you learn to write by reading. And, it’swhat I notice about a lot of today’s writers—they don’t seem to have read muchof quality. I began by reading Balzac and de Maupassant and the Russians when Iwas six and seven and eight years old. I see so many writers who say they beganreading the Hardy Boys and cannot believe they’ll ever amount to a whole lot inletters. Is that elitist? Sure, but to be a good or great writer is the verydefinition of elitism. Can you imagine Saul Bellow attending some of today’swriter’s conventions or even being aware of them? Hemingway might show up butonly because he had a commercial side and figured out people would buy himdrinks. I’m pretty sure Flannery O’Connor wouldn’t even consider something likethat. She valued her brain cells more than that… Too much class and pride towork the room like a high school kid trying to get enough votes for classpresident  or prom king.Reading voraciously and reading a quality listfrom the age of five or six is the key to becoming anything more than aformulaic or hack writer. Being also a genius doesn’t hurt. I get students whoread an average of 5-10 books a year and I know they’re never going to writeanything I’d want to read. Their literary heroes are John Gresham, Stephen Kingand the like. It used to be that anyone who read those kinds of authors wouldnever admit it in public but those days have changed… It says a lot when a “writer”claims that one of his writing heroes is Stephen King. You can pretty well betthis isn’t a writer who can tell the difference between an Ian Fleming noveland The Stranger although he probably would never read the latter. What are your influences, literary or otherwise?I’ll list those who’ve written stories I admireand those I’ve learned something from. I always hate doing this as I can’tbegin to list them all and after the interview comes out I feel badly aboutforgetting someone who should be on the list. Please forgive me the omissions. Here ya go. The Bible. Harry Crews, Camus,Borges, Steve Hamilton, Joe Lansdale, Anthony Smith, Paul Brazill, Ray Banks,David Sedaris, Dennis Lehane, Elmore Leonard, Raymond Carver, Ken Bruen,Christopher Moore, Flannery O’Connor, James Dickey, Faulkner, Nelson Algren,Charles Bukowski, Elaine Ash, Kurt Vonnegut, Jim Murray, Larry Brown, HelenFitzGerald, Barry Hannah, Les Edgerton—yeah, myself—I read my own workoften--Celine, Mark Twain, Guillermo O’Joyce, Sherman Alexie, RichardBrautigan, Callie Khouri, Janet Burroway, Linwood Barclay, David Mamet, CormacMcCarthy, Anton Chekhov, Saul Bellow, Pete Dexter, Larry Watson--a lot more I’mforgetting right now. You’ll notice most are older or dead and that’s because Idon’t see a lot of competition for great writing these days. I see a lot ofwork you might call “satisfactory” but little that is actual genius. It’s likea sea of mediocre TV series’ episodes that look a lot alike out there. Name tenbooks that actually affected you emotionally in the last couple of years. Namefive. Hell, name one or two! Name one person writing today who could write abook to match one of Nelson Algren’s. There are a handful but a small handful.Sorry about the bitterness. I nearly died a fewweeks ago and it kind of changed my outlook on life and writing. I’ve comeclose to death before but prior to this was young enough I didn’t reallybelieve I could die. Now I know it’s always very close. And it made me want tonever again lie for the sake of being liked. I’d much rather be respected andeven hated for being forthright and honest than for making somebody feel good.Write a truly great book like The Lock Artist,Trout Fishing in America, The Stranger, A Feast of Snakes, The Rapist, NoCountry for Old Men, or a short story as brilliant as “A Good Man Is Hard toFind” or “The Fiend” and then you’ll be a writer and not just an author.What’s next for you?Well, since I’ve just committed professionalsuicide with this interview, about all that’s left is to get my affairs inorder, then lay down in the casket and cross my hands and await thepallbearers.In the meantime, I’ll be finalizing my memoir, AdrenalineJunkie, which comes out this fall from Down&Out Books. Maybe it’ll winone of those awards some of my other books should have won. Probably not… Finishingup a novel based on a short story I wrote when I was 12 and that my agent urgedme to write, saying it “haunted her” and that if I wrote it well, could be asgood as No Country for Old Men.At any rate, thank you for this opportunity,Will. Hope the haters won’t include you—you just were the gracious host whoasked the questions and didn’t realize he was talking to the angry old bastardthreatening the kids on his lawn with his .12 gauge…And, I don’t really hate many of my fellowwriters. I just don’t want to have drinks with some of you… and I’m sure thefeeling’s mutual. That’s what we call a “big hairy-ass deal”… not… Too many “nice”guys (to one’s face) out there who I wouldn’t turn my back on for a nanosecond.I love the real men and women of literature. I detest the phonies that work theroom and can’t do the real work of writing. As we say in Texas, too manywriters today are “all hat and no cattle.”Blue skies,LesI prefer gray, but…wow.

{"title": "FLU", "date": "Friday, February 23, 2018", "text": "Hi folks,Sorry I’ve been absent the past couple ofweeks, but I’ve had the flu and then had a relapse. I don’t know if I was neardeath but it sure felt like it. I seem to have pulled through and that was totallydue to my beautiful wife Mary who was the best nurse I’ve ever had.It all began with asurprise birthday party Mary sprung on me two days before my actual birthday onFebruary 11 at a local Mexican restaurant we like. Somehow she kept the wholething secret from me and I was knocked out when we walked in and there weredozens of my friends and relatives. I’ve never had a surprise party before, andat age 75 was running out of opportunities. She really created a magical timefor me, one I’ll never forget.But, literally the momentwe went back home, the misery began. Almost the instant we walked in the doorwe were both knocked to our knees. There was no doubt what we had. It hit sohard, I had to cancel our online class and as it was only our second week thattook some doing. It ended up I had to cancel a second week and I’ve never hadto do that.We went to the doctor andwere quickly diagnosed and put on Tamiflu It worked for Mary—although she wentback to work a couple of days too early, but that’s Mary. I just got worse andworse. It was all I could do to get out of bed a few times a day to go to thebathroom and that trip was just debilitating. We took me back to the doctor andhe put me on a bunch of other medicines and COPD measures. I truly thought Iwas going to die. Truth be told, I wantedto die. If this was going to be the way the rest of my life would be, I didn’twant anything to do with it. I couldn’t breathe—it felt like I was continuallysuffocating; I couldn’t sleep—it was just a constant barrage ofcoughing,coughing, coughing all night long. The worse was I couldn’t think. Acouple of times I went to my computer and tried to focus on a student’s workand just couldn’t make myself read it intelligently. But, I’ve recovered. Shouldbe able to return to class on Monday. A couple of things tookplace while I was will that I wasn’t able to report on then. A blogpost I’dpreviously been asked to contribute was printed and here it is. Hope you enjoyit. And then, I’d recorded a radio podcast with Dr. Paul Reeves out of Detroit.The broadcast comes out shortly and links are below. Blue skies,LesFEBRUARY 14TH, 2018Writers in the storm  http://writersinthestormblog.com/?p=33309Using Third Person vs First Person Novel NarrativesBy GuestBloggerLes EdgertonHi folks,A source of discussion that always comes up at the beginning of myclasses is whether the writer should use first- or third-person. The shortanswer I usually give, is: “Whatever the material calls for.”Since that doesn’t adequately address the question, I go on toamplify the answer, and that’s what I’ll do here as well.First, I ask the student who wants to employ first-person why theychose that stance. Almost without exception, they’ll state, “Well, it’s justmore intimate. Third person is too formal for the character I want to createfor the story.”That’s when I proceed to knock holes in that theory.Before I do that, here are a few things I’ve observed. Morebeginning writers than established writers tend to write in first-person. Farmore people who’ve been published are aware that third person is considered the“professional” POV and that first-person is often considered the “amateur” POV.Now, before everybody starts yelling at me that there are tons ofexcellent books out there written in first-person, let me assure you I’m wellaware of that. If I may, I’d like to refer you back to my short answer:“Whatever the material calls for.” There are often times when the materialcalls for first person. However… not as often as is sometimes realized.Let me explain.The chief reason many agents and editors prefer third person andcall it the “professional” POV, is that the overwhelming percentage ofsuccessful books and bestsellers are written in third person. This isn’t anaccident. There are reasons this is the case.Actually, the overwhelming majority of manuscripts that arrive ina publisher’s or agent’s office are written in first-person. If that’s so (andit is), then why would more third-person efforts become published? Well,because many more manuscripts are submitted by beginners than by pros. By thetime one goes from the beginner’s group to the published group, the numbers inthe second group have dramatically diminished. That means the second group isgoing to be predominantly writing in third person. Fewer people by far in thatgroup, but a much higher percentage of publishable manuscripts. Most in thirdperson…This simply goes back to my observation above that more beginningwriters employ first-person than do seasoned pros. Editors and agents have alsonoted this fact. Overwhelmingly so do beginners prefer to write in first-rather than third-person.That means that when a gatekeeper encounters a first-person manuscript,it goes without saying that a little red light goes on (from his/her pastexperiences) that chances are pretty good this mss came from a… less seasonedwriter. And, it’s just a fact of life and the business of writing that thenewer the writer, the less likely the mss will be of publishable quality.Does that mean when your first-person opus lands on an editor’s oragent’s desk it is doomed from the start? Ofcourse not. But, a writer should be aware that there’s a bit of a bias alreadyin place against first-person.If it’s a book that should have been written in first rather thanthird, and it’s written well and is of publishable quality, no problem. Anygood editor or agent will be able to tell within a couple of pages if it’swritten well or not, no matter what POV stance the author has elected.Why do agents and editors feel this way about first-person? Thisgets to the heart of the matter. The reason many hold first-person in anegative light is that anyone who’s read many manuscripts knows that a greatmany first-person novels are thinly-disguised autobiographies, usuallyespousing some recently-learned political or social philosophy, or, if notthat, their imitation of some current (or just-over) line of bestsellers. Atpresent, this includes vampire or zombie opuses, or invincible characters wholook suspiciously like Jack Reacher but have different names.Another reason many choose a first-person narrator is that itseems easier tonewer writers. Many (many!) first novels are written with characters saying andthinking things the writer him- or herself thinks in their own minds. Novelsthat are fiction in name only; primarily many are just vehicles to assign thewriter’s own thoughts to in a loosely-degenerative plot.Those are all secondary reasons why some writers choosefirst-person. Overwhelmingly, however, the biggest single reason lots ofwriters choose first is that they feel it’s a more intimate POV. Itseems to make sense. After all, if one is writing “I” from their character’sPOV, one can’t get much closer to the character, can they?You saw this coming, didn’t you!Of course there’s a way to achieve the same intimacy with thirdperson as there is with first. And, it’s easy.Simply by employing a close thirdperson, not a formal third. A narrative that uses aclose third achieves exactly the same intimacy with the reader as a firstperson does. The good news is that by using a close third person you get allthe positives and none of the negatives of first person.The bad news is… well, there isn’t any bad news. It’s a win-winsituation.And, how does one achieve this magical close third that feelslike first person with none of the baggage of first? Again, it’s easy. You simply substitute personal pronouns forthe character’s name. That’s it. Sounds too good to be true, doesn’t it?Let’s take a look. Examples are the best way to prove a point.I’ll give you a section of narrative in which a formal third isused. Then, I’ll give the same passage in first person. And, finally, I’llfollow that with the same narrative, only this time with personal pronouns in aclose third person. I feel confident that as soon as you read them you’ll seeand feel the difference.***From my short story, “My Idea of a Nice Thing” first publishedin Breeze andincluded in my short story collection, “Monday’s Meal.” (The two people are atan A.A. meeting and it’s about a third through the story.)First, the passage in a formal third person:           “My idea of a nice thing,” he said, “would be a world where you could get drunkand it wouldn’t harm you, physically, anyway.”           Raye turned and offered her hand. “My name is Raye.”           “Hi, Raye. Emory. Like the board.”           Raye didn’t quite get it and first and then she did and smiled.           “I liked what you said that time, about sorting yourself out.”           Again, Raye didn’t get it at first, and then she realized he must have been atthe meeting she’d first gotten up and spoken at.           “Well, yeah,” Raye said, “It’s kind of like that, but boy did I get in troublesaying that!”           “From Jim, right?” ‘You shouldn’t talk about the joys of drink at a meeting ora place where that’s all the people think about?’ That Jim?” He grinned, andRaye saw he had great teeth, even and white, and what was nice was the way hesmiled. Like he was unaware of how great his teeth really were, that he wassmiling just because he was happy or had thought of something funny. “There’sbeen talk of replacing ol’ Jim. He gets his meetings mixed up, thinks this isParents Without Partners.”           There must have been something in Raye’s face that made him realize he’d saidthe wrong thing.           “Look, I’m sorry. Let’s get out of here,” he said. “Go get a drink.”           They use the same pickup lines here that they do in bars, Raye thought.           “I don’t mean a drink with liquor in it,” he said. “I mean a Coke or something,but in a bar. This place feels like a hospital. It’s depressing.”           “This is ahospital… Emory,” Raye added his name haltingly, knowing that once she’d saidit she was going to leave with him.That’sa formal third. Now, read the same passage as first person.           “My idea of a nice thing,” he said, “would be a world where you could get drunkand it wouldn’t harm you, physically, anyway.”           “Raye,” I said, turning and offering my hand. “My name is Raye.”           “Hi, Raye. Emory. Like the board.”           I didn’t quite get it at first and then I did and smiled.           “I liked what you said that time, about sorting yourself out.”           Again, I didn’t get it at first, and then I realized he must have been at themeeting I’d first gotten up and spoken at.           “Well, yeah,” I said, “It’s kind of like that, but boy did I get in troublesaying that!”           “From Jim, right?” ‘You shouldn’t talk about the joys of drink at a meeting ora place where that’s all the people think about?’ That Jim?” He grinned, and Isaw he had great teeth, even and white, and what was nice was the way hesmiled. Like he was unaware of how great his teeth really were, that he wassmiling just because he was happy or had thought of something funny. “There’sbeen talk of replacing ol’ Jim.

This place feels like a hospital. It’s depressing.”           “This is ahospital… Emory,” I added his name haltingly, knowing that once I’d said it Iwas going to leave with him.And,finally, the same passage as a close third. See if you don’t agree it feelsexactly like first person.           “My idea of a nice thing,” he said, “would be a world where you could get drunkand it wouldn’t harm you, physically, anyway.”           “Raye,” she said, turning and offering her hand. “My name is Raye.”           “Hi, Raye.

The same level of intimacy? Kinda neat, isn’t it!How do you know when the “material calls for first or thirdperson?”There’s a handy-dandy litmus test. If you can substitute personalpronouns for all the “I’s” in the narrative and it doesn’t affect the story…then it should be in third. If it does affect the story and in a negative way,then it should be in first. Most of the time I think you’ll find that it worksbetter in third person. A close thirdperson.Personally, I often write in first person. Mostly for shortstories. For novels, occasionally I’ll use first person, but mostly I opt forthird. A close third.Try it yourself. Take a passage written in a formal third (wherethe POV character’s name is used often) and rewrite it, taking out all theinstances where the name is used and substitute personal pronouns for the POVcharacter’s name. (This is once the character’s name is on the page and thereader knows who the “he” or “she” is.) Then, recast it in first person andcompare the close third version with the first person version and see if youdon’t agree they feel pretty much the same.Or, take a previously-written passage in first person andsubstitute personal pronouns for the I’s. If you don’t feel any or very muchdifference, guess what? It might be a better POV to use.Hope this helps!Blue skies,Les*  *  * *  *  *ABOUTLESLesEdgerton is an ex-con, matriculating at Pendleton Reformatory in the sixtiesfor burglary.

It’s got to be asuper-likeable funny main character to keep me engaged in first person. And Ifind present tense so distracting. I have a really hard time reading it,although I have seen it used well in some short stories.·        Laura DrakeFebruary 14,2018 at 5:42 am · ReplyThankyou for this clear, well thought out defense of third person, Les. Had a hardtime getting past the ‘less than’ of 1st, but I get what you’re saying.Onemore reason to use third (deep third) – I’m writing a 3 book series. The voicethat came to me in the first story was first person, so I wrote it that way.The second story should be third – but my editor told me I’d have to stick with1st the whole 3 books.Or, Icould rewrite the first in third.Um, nothanks.·        Mary BaileyFebruary 14,2018 at 7:20 am · ReplyDearLes,I readyour article with great interest.

Is that the same as close third person?Mary·        Maggie SmithFebruary 14,2018 at 8:42 am · ReplyI haveuntil tomorrow to submit 50 pages for a workshop in April and I’ve been writingin third person for the first time (my debut novel is in 1st- yup, just likeyou said above-first time author and all that). Readers have been saying thenew story seems too distant. Went through and changed those “names” to thepersonal pronouns and voila! all the difference. Thanks, Les. Couldn’t havecome at a better time. I know there’s a bit more to it (like observations thatthis character would make in a particular scene that only she would be attunedto to make it seem more “close”) but your quick fix gets me most of the waythere,·        Jerry TabbottFebruary 14,2018 at 9:04 am · ReplyThoughI have to consider myself a beginner, third person is my preference – partlybecause most of what I personally read is in third, but mostly because I likestories with multiple plot threads. Sharing other character’s POVs to advancetheir threads. I’m sure you’ll receive much push-back on first person being atendency for beginners. Also, I’m not so sure the third-person bias you mentionis still so true, given the explosion of first person series we are witnessing.Publishers, I’m sure, are still looking for what is popular.·        Jerry TabbottFebruary 14,2018 at 9:06 am · ReplyIsincerely wish I could edit my posts here to clean up errors.

THANKS for addressing the subject. First as areader I’m feeling vindicated because I really can’t stand READING books in thefirst-person. Never quite sure why. Maybe ’cause the MC can’t say anythingpositive about herself without being stuck up, or point out her own flawswithout sounding falsely self-deprecatory–heck, the minute they start to talkabout themselves at all, it’s ruined for me.So. Ithink I write a close 3rd in the heart of scenes–with dialogues, interactions.But surely there’s more to it than replacing pronouns? I pick a POV and mostlystick with it for the scene, using italics for their thoughts if needed. Ispend a little more time getting in their heads. I’m not Hemingway.Havingsaid that, Mary had a good question. My “narrator” is at other times more of anomniscient one; I have a definite voice (I’m told, hoping that’s a good thing).If I juxtapose two seemingly unrelated sentences for effect, giving the readera potential “ah-ha” moment, isn’t that the work of an omnisicent narrator? Ordropping bits of back-story, world-building–there isn’t always a character toattribute those thoughts to.Ireally don’t know if I’m conflating omniscient and close 3rds in a way thatcould be disastrous. It feels natural but the POV-police could give me a ticketif they caught me.·        deborahbrasketFebruary 14,2018 at 9:38 am · ReplyVeryinteresting. I hadn’t know there was a bias against first person. As it is, Iwrite almost always in deep 3rd. Where I struggle with using only pronouns forthe pov character is when there are conversations between two males or twofemales. Sometimes I find I have to use the POV character’s name instead of thepronoun for clarity. In your example, if Raye had been male, how would you havehandled it? Would you simply have used Emory’s name instead of he in everyinstance, and said “the man” for the first “he’ when Ray doesn’t know his name?It sounds a bit stilted that way, especially in the long paragraph.·        Libby SommerFebruary 14,2018 at 1:24 pm · Replyveryinteresting article. thanks so much for the info Les. shame you have the sametypo repeated three times in the examples style='word-break:break-word;font-variant-ligatures: normal;font-variant-caps: normal;orphans: 2;text-align:start;widows: 2;-webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px;word-spacing:0px' alt=\"🙂\" draggable=false class=emoji v:shapes=\"_x0000_i1025\">·        lesedgertonFebruary 14,2018 at 1:32 pm · ReplySorry Ican’t reply right now but came down with a severe case of the flu two daysago–as soon as I’m up to it I’ll address the issues–thanks for your patience!Blue skies, Leso    Jenny HansenFebruary 14,2018 at 2:52 pm · ReplyThis flu is so dreadful!

{"title": "New Online Class and a Couple of Openings", "date": "Saturday, January 20, 2018", "text": "Hifolks,Well,we’re just finishing up our final week on the current session of my onlinenovel-writing class, “Les Edgerton’s Bootcamp for Writers,” and find ourselves with a couple of openings. Our next session will begin on Feb 4 and consists of aten-week session, with the probability of taking a week off sometime during theterm to recharge batteries.Thisis a call for new class members. Not sure how many openings we’ll have as weoffer vacancies first to our auditors.Thebasics are the course costs $400 and it’s limited to ten-twelve people. The $400 isnonrefundable, as if a person quits during the session it would be impossibleto fill that vacancy. As this is my primary source of income, it would bedetrimental for myself and my family. It’s very rare that anyone opts out oncebegun, however. In over five years, there have only been two.We’vehad a remarkable history of success. Nearly three dozen writers over the pastten years who have become a part of our class or whom I’ve coached privately have gone on to being legitimately published and/or secured a good literary agent.In fact, that is our only goal—to become legitimately published. Meagan Beaumont, me, and Linda Thompson, two of our students who've published books, at a meeting in ArizonaL-R Top: George Weir, Reavis Worthen, Scott MontgomeryBottom: Me. At an event at the BookPeople Bookstore in Austin, TXI try to warn people who arethinking of joining us, how tough the class is, but I know from past experiencethat even so forewarned, at least some are going to be in for a shock when theysee that we really don’t hold hands, pat people on the back for minimumefforts, or overlook writing that doesn’t work. I’m not cruel (at least I don’tthink so) nor are any of the oldtimers in class, but most new folks haven’tbeen exposed to a class like ours. The truth is, most writers who haven’t had aclass like ours has been praised in other classes or most likely, has been inclasses that use the “sandwich” method of teaching. You know—that deal wherethe teach applies a bit of praise, then a bit of criticism, and then a bit of praise.Well, that ain’t our shtick. Not even close. The comments we all provide oneveryone’s work fit one definition only. They’re honest.This isn’t to be mean or to act likewe’re the only folks around who know what good writing is. Except… we do. I’mnot aware of any other class out there with the kind of track record oursenjoys. Virtually every writer who stays the course with us ends up with a topagent and/or a book deal. That doesn’t happen in a single ten-week session.About the earliest anyone has earned an agent or book deal in our class hasbeen about a year. And, that’s reasonable.The thing is, our writers don’texpect things to be easy.Ifigured I’d let some of the class members give you their take on our class.They don’t hold back and they all have tough skins. They will all tell you thesame thing. It isn’t a class for sissies or for those who need their hands heldor lots of pats on the back. Becoming published is hard, hard work and isn’t anundertaking for sissies. To get there, our students know they have to put ontheir Big Boy and Big Girl pants and expect to work harder than they ever havein their lives—and to never, ever “settle” their standards of excellence.From a student several years ago:Hi ________. Since Les opened thefloor for comments from the \"class veterans\" I'm chipping in with mytwo cents. I have a file cabinet filled with stuff I sent Les and then neededasbestos gloves to take the paper off the printer. When I started this journey,I'd never taken an English class past high school. (I was pre-med in college) Ifigured I love to read, so how hard can it be? Okay, quit laughing at me.Clearly, when I wrote my first version of my first novel, I had no idea aboutstory structure, POV, any of that. I figured I'm pretty articulate andtherefore I can write?Les quickly set me straight. All ofthis is to point out that we've all been on the receiving end of Les' brutalhonesty. I will find some of the comments he made on my work and post them butphrases like \"throwing up in my mouth now\" and \"bury this so deepin the yard no one ever finds it\" are seared into my brain and I don'thave to look to find those!!! The point is, I took other classes before I metLes and the teachers were kind and gentle and never told me I sucked. If itweren't for Les, I'd still be churning out awful drivel that makes people wantto throw up instead of trying not to throw up while I wait to see if my agentis able to sell my book. I would never have gotten an agent without Les. Sohang in there. Listen to everything he says and if it doesn't make sense, askaway.From another student:The novel that I am currently tryingto sell has been a work in progress for several years. The first time Les sawit he sent it back and told me to re-write the WHOLE thing!!! My character wasa wimp. She sat back and let things happen to her. I argued a little, rewrote alittle and then moved on to another book. After a year, I went back and rereadit and saw the truth. It was awful. So I took a deep breath and started over.Page one. First sentence. Re-wrote the entire thing. It took a full year andthen I revised it again. It's definitely a process. But once you get the incitingincident and the outline steps down pat, it's a whole lot easier. Trust me!!!And you'll never graduate completely. A few months ago, Les and I went head-to-headon one single passage. I was trying to be lazy and take the easy way out. Hecalled me on it and I resubmitted three or four weeks in a row, revisions onthe same passage. I was sure my classmates were so sick of it they were goingto stick needles in their eyes rather than read it again! But in the end, thepassage rocked!! So hang in there!!!! It'll get better. (Note: This novel soldand the writer is currently working on her fifth novel.)Classmembers come from all over the globe. We’ve had students from the UK, Ireland,Taiwan, Spain, all parts of the U.S., Canada, Australia, Luxembourg, Malta and manyother places. We work with writers in virtually every genre on the bookshelves. Genre is unimportant as we recognize but two genres--good writing and bad writing.Theway class works is that the class is divided into two equal groups. We used tohave just one group, but it got to be too much for many students. In the past,everybody in the class was required to read everybody else’s work each week andprovide in-depth comments on everyone’s work. That meant they had to read nineother class members’ work and deliver intelligent commentary on each one. We’vesince evolved to a more manageable number where now each class member reads anddelivers comments on just four other classmates’ work. I provide comments oneverybody’s work and that’s why the class is limited to only ten or twelve. With a dozen or less writers, I can give each person the quality of time and analysis each deserves.Eachweek begins on Sunday evening, when people can begin submitting their weeklypages from Sunday until Thursday. If it’s a new writer to the class, they areallowed to submit their first five pages of their novel, plus an outline whichconsists of five statements and a total of 15-20 words. Oldtimers in class callthis “inciting incident hell.” If the outline isn’t working and their beginningdoesn’t represent the inciting incident as provided in their outline, they arerequired to keep submitting each week until it does. Our feeling is if theyhaven’t thought through their novels sufficiently and provided a publishablenovel structure (evidenced by the outline), then they most likely don’t have anovel ready to be written and to simply plunge ahead will almost invariablylead to an unfinished novel. We don’t want that.Oncethey’ve been okayed for the beginning, from thereafter they can submit up toeight pages per week, along with the others in class.Timezones don’t matter. Everybody’s work, including everyone’s comments and my owncomments on each person’s work each week is posted on the class site and folkscan go to it any time of the day or night. Class members can begin sending backtheir comments on each others’ in their group from Sunday through the followingSunday, when it begins again. Although, in practicality, most members send intheir work each week on Wednesdays and Thursdays. It’s like being in an“on-ground” class in that everything said or done in class is seen byeverybody.Wedo have a chat function and people use it all the time, even though they’re in differenttime zones. One of the best things about this class is that we have lots ofoldtimers who know from their own experience what works in a novel and whatdoesn’t and more importantly… why itworks or doesn’t work. It’s like having a group of seven or eight otherprofessionals helping you with your own novel. Probably at any given time inclass, there will be four or five who already have had a novel or severalpublished as a result of being in class, so it’s a really rarified group. And,if you think that you couldn’t operate in a situation like this because you’rea beginner, that simply isn’t the case here at all. Nearly every single personin each class began just the way you did, as a rank beginner. And, theyremember and they have complete empathy for your situation, if you’re abeginning writer.It’snot a situation of simply saying, “This doesn’t work.” Myself and others inclass will surely say that, but we then let you know why it didn’t work andgive you solid suggestions on how to make it work. We collectively have anurturing nature and all of us want the newcomer to succeed just about as badlyas that writer wants to.Ifyou are still interested but still feel intimidated, we have a second option. Auditing the class. I think if you simply lookat how the class works, you’ll quickly see how you’ll fit in comfortably. The auditor function works the same as it does in a “regular” college class. You’re admittedto class and can view every single thing we’re doing and the entire classsession is archived and easy to access. The cost of auditing theclass is $50, and auditors always get the first shot at future openings. If interested in this option, just email me at butchedgerton@comcast.netand let me know and I’ll have our class administrator, Holly, get you on boardasap.Iknow there are no doubt a lot of questions you may have. Please feel free tocontact me at any time and ask me anything you’d like.Frompast experience, when we’ve had openings like this, they go quickly, so if youare interested, please get in touch via my email above, okay?Forthose interested in such things, here are a few of my own qualifications toteach writing.MFAin Writing from Vermont CollegeTaughtwriting for the UCLA Writer’s ProgramTaughtwriting via Skype for the New York Writer’s WorkshopWriter-in-Residencefor three years for the University of ToledoWriter-in-Residencefor one year for Trine UniversityTaughtwriting classes for St. Francis UniversityTaughtwriting classes for Phoenix CollegeTaughtwriting for Writer’s Digest Online ClassesTaughtwriting classes for Vermont CollegePublished20 books, including craft books on writing, novels, sports books, YA novel,historical nonfiction book, humor nonfiction, black comedy novel, noir,thrillers, literary and existential fiction.Dozensof short stories published in such publications as The South Carolina Review,High Plains Literary Review, Aethlon, Flatmancrooked, Murdaland, Best AmericanMystery Stories and many others.Alot of living… much of it as an outlaw…Blueskies,Les"},
{"title": "BEST REVIEW EVER!", "date": "Thursday, January 18, 2018", "text": "Hi folks,I hardlyever do this, but this review just meant so much to me I decided to post ithere. This morning when I woke up, I went to my email as I always do. And therewas an email from a guy that the writers on here will appreciate.

This is the kind of reward thatthose who work only for money or a pension or material things will never get toexperience and why I feel truly sorry for them. And why I feel especiallyblessed.This cameat the perfect time.

{"title": "CRIMESPREE MAGAZINE INTERVIEW", "date": "Saturday, January 6, 2018", "text": "Hi folks,A few months ago, Anthony Campbell interviewed me for Crimespree Magazine. Anthony asked some of the most intelligent questions I've ever been asked. Here's the interview and if you're interested in glomming onto a copy of the magazine, you can buy the ebook copy on Amazon here.Not sure when the paperback copy will be available for sale, but when it is I'll post that info here.Les Edgerton InterviewedBy Anthony CampbellIssue 66 Crimespree MagazineLes Edgerton isn’t the writer who is here to judge you;over the course of a few emails we traded back and forth, I found him to be oneof the most receptive and open individuals I have had the chance to correspondwith.With over 19 books ranging from hard-boiled crimenovels to business guides under his belt, not to mention the countless shortstories he has had published, Edgerton certainly is a busy man with the honestwork to show for it. Just this year, he informed he has “at least three moreworks of fiction coming.” Readers may have heard of him from THE GENUINE,IMITATION, PLASTIC KIDNAPPING, THE BITCH, THE RAPIST or THE DEATH OF TARPONS.Hiscurrent short story collection, LAGNIAPPE, is available through Down & OutBooks. I was able to discuss two of his prior novels, THE RAPIST and THEGENUINE, IMITATION, PLASTIC KIDNAPPING as well as history over two months ofemails.Anthony Campbell: Thank youagain for taking the time to let me reach out and interview you. I wanted tostart with a few questions on your 2013 novel, THE RAPIST. This was your firstnovel that I read and I found it to be quite the tour-de-force. Where did theidea of the novel come from?LesEdgerton: The germ of the idea came from reading a Charles Bukowski shortstory, “The Fiend.” At that point, it was just a glimpse of a potential story,what Blake Snyder calls “the smell of the night on the road at dawn.” What doesthe term mean? It’s that germ of an idea for a story triggered by any number ofstimuli. It can be a glimpse of something—the “smell of the rain on the road atdawn” for instance. Driving home from a night of partying, hung over, you turnonto a country blacktop and see a man hitchhiking in Army fatigues in the finemist that’s falling. Aha! There’s a story about this guy, you think. You beginto imagine a character who’s passing through town—and you kind of visualize astory about him. If you’re David Morrell, you end up with a story titled, FIRSTBLOOD. Or,you hear a story about a man whose mother has just died and the police came toinform him and they’re put off by his seeming lack of emotion about the tragedyand become suspicious. If you’re Albert Camus, perhaps you write a story basedon that anecdote you’ll title, THE STRANGER If you’re me, you come up with a story titled THE RAPIST.Allof us as writers get ideas triggered like this and any number of other ways.Thinking about the scene or idea makes us feel that there’s a story there.Usually, when we see or conceive of a story idea that way, it elicits apowerful emotion from us. The guy in our vision, standing on the road at dawnin a drizzle, wearing fatigues, triggers a feeling of sadness, say. We have anurge to write this guy’s story so that the reader will feel this same intensefeeling of sadness as we do.Andso, we break out the Bic, turn on the ‘puter, put a piece of white paper in theUnderwood and begin to write. And it fizzles out.Why?As Blake Snyder says, we’ve simply fallen in love with an inspiration. That’sall it is. There’s no story there yet mostly because we haven’t yet come upwith a story. All we’ve got is a guy standing in the rain on a blacktop and a feelingthat thisis a story. It’s gossamer. It’s not a story because we haven’t taken the timeto think beyond this image very much.Thisis what I suggest for those who get that “Smell of the rain…” kind of image andinspiration for a novel. Sit on it for a while. Think about it. Kick the tires.See if it has legs. See if you can see any depth in it. If something else comesup and diverts your attention away from it, that probably means the idea reallywasn’t novel-worthy to begin with. But…the idea that won’t go away, that begsto be told, that begins to unfold in your imagination over a period of time ofat least a month or two and hopefully even longer—that’s probably an idea thathas legs and one you can run that marathon with.Andthat’s what I did with THE RAPIST. Let it percolate in my brain for about ten years. Iwon’t go through the entire process, but I kept niggling the original ideaaround, adding a piece here, a piece there, until I had a bona fide story.AC: How was constructing the character of Truman Ferris Pinter differentthan others you have made before? Was it more difficult to fit into his voicethan others?LE: Referring back to thefirst question, as the story began to take shape in my mind, Truman becameclearer and clearer until I had him nailed. Not so much in a superficialway—what he looked like, for instance, but how his mind worked. How hisbackground shaped him. What makes him different from most other rapists. Once Ihad that, his voice became mine. As Whitman said, “We contain multitudes.” And,we do. What I became was an actor playing a part. The more talent one has as anactor, the better he or she can mimic others. The catalyst came when I realizedwho he really was. Jesus Christ. Jesus Christ whose father, God, played a cruelpractical joke on. Oddly enough, this is where most reviewers missed the wholepoint of the story. Since most see him as an unreliable narrator, they saw thevery last line as the absolute proof that Truman was an unreliable narrator. Hewas…until the very last line, which was the exact moment his eyes were openedand he saw clearly who he was for the first time in his earthly life. That wasthe illumination and why it had to be the end of his story. Everything thathappened to him led to that precise moment when he realizes he’s Christ. And,it’s a true realization, not the “truth” of an insane person—an actual, literaltruth. The veil has just been lifted.AC: Many literary allusions abound and comparisons have been made toCamus’ THE STRANGER. Ipersonally found the shape of this novel to fit in a similar vein as a Kafkastory or a Lynch film. Do you find the comparisons by reviewers to besurprising? Have there been any which you had found to be of particularinterest?LE: I understand the Camuscomparison but don’t think it’s accurate. I wrote it in a similar tone as THESTRANGER mostly because both Meursault and Truman view their experiences froman amoral standpoint. Also, many reviewers see my book as an existential bookand reviewers often believe Camus was an existentialist writer. He foughtagainst that opinion all of his life, at one point getting together with Sarteto run an add stating clearly that they had nothing in common, philosophy-wise.I am often referred to as an existential writer and I feel the same as didCamus. So, in basing that on an inaccurate belief system neither of us claims,it’s an accurate comparison. I think we’re both subject to a wrong take on ourphilosophies. I can also see you comparing it to a Kafka story. On the surface,it appears that Gregor and Truman are similar. Where I don’t think they are isthat Kafka’s character both starts and ends as an unreliable narrator, Trumandoesn’t, but to a certain mindset it appears they are the same. The reviewers Ithought came closest to what I intended were Cort McMeel and William Joyce.AC: Although Truman doesn’t seem to particularly careabout the judgment society passes against him, by recounting his crime andlife, he constructs a testimony for the reader. He places the reader as thejudge. Does Truman care about what we, as readers, think of him?LE: Although he claims he doesn’t, he’s an unreliablenarrator which is fairly clear early. Since the way a reader tells theprotagonist is an unreliable narrator is to match his actions to what he’ssaying, and since he claims he doesn’t care, his action in presenting his storytells us he does care or else he wouldn’t have bothered telling his story.AC: Still a few weeks after my first reading of this novel, the entirelast part and the ending of the novel resonate with me, making me stillquestion not only these parts of the novel, but more importantly, giving way tore-evaluating how I considered some things in society. When you finishedwriting this novel, did you feel like this was certainly something whichreaders would take away from? Did you think it would make readers challengepreconceptions and ideas they held?LE: What I hoped for fromreaders was based on a belief I possess. That there are thousands and thousands(millions?) of ideas that are floating out there and that many of those ideasare shared with many others. A zeitgeist, if you will, or a kind of racememory. That there’s a field of electricity—kind of an invisible “soup” if youwill, that’s everywhere in the atmosphere, where ideas come from individualminds and that enter other minds that are receptive. I think that as people getolder they cease being receptive to these ideas for lots of reasons—a religiousbody of belief for instance, that’s been indoctrinated into their minds andwon’t tolerate deviances from the official canon; a physical experience that weexperience in childhood that gets sublimated as we grow older and that we learnthrough ridicule by adults to deny in our hearts; awareness of other dimensionsas a child, that awareness trampled over again by seeing those kinds of ideasroutinely derided by everyone else as we grow older.For example, I have veryclear memories of being able to leave my body and hover in space when I was achild. That memory is one that got ridiculed and attacked any time I mentionedit, so little by little I forced myself to look at the experience as justsomething I dreamed so I could escape ridicule. And, then, in my twenties Ihappened on some literature about a group called “Eckanar” which was composedof people who swore they had out of body experiences just as I had and that wasthe beginning of my belief in a zeitgeist. I believe that, little by little,our existence becomes more and more an artificial one in which others graduallyimprison each of us into a world that isn’t actual but is induced by others whoare fearful of the actual world or who really don’t know what is real and whatisn’t but are afraid of admitting they think differently from those around themfor fear of ridicule or worse—worse being locked up in mental wards or inprison, or even killed, or simply shunned by the majority of people in theirsociety as that is the nature of the mob—to reject anyone whose beliefs falloutside what they consider “safe” parameters. In other words, I came tobelieve that we’ve all been brainwashed, not necessarily by some evil group ofpeople whose aim is to control or enslave people, but by a mindset that to openoneself to ideas and thoughts outside the parameters of their particularsociety will only lead to anarchy. I don’t see this as any “plot” by a fewpeople, but more as a natural thing for most people who sense that any thinkingthey don’t share is dangerous. I don’t think this is an inherited way ofthinking but more of a learned behavior. That most people are fearful of anyonedifferent and to protect themselves they either invent or adopt stances towardthose they see as different. And, so, little by little we lose the insights wehad as children and learn to sublimate any ideas outside the main. I think thismay be what Jesus was talking about when he said that to enter Heaven, one mustbecome as a “little child.” To go back to that age where we all had originalthoughts and didn’t dismiss things out of hand that adults would consideraberrant behavior. I know this is a longwindedreply to your question, but I think the question demands a lengthy answer to beclear. A bumper sticker reply won’t suffice for what I see is a veryintelligent question about a complicated issue. I have to say that yourquestions are a welcome change from many interviewers who often ask idiotquestions like “where do you get your ideas” or “what time of day do you writein?” To sum up my answer, I thinkthose readers who still challenge the status quo in their lives uponencountering issues raised in the book will feel a sense of déjà vu in thatthey’ve also had these same thoughts. To those who shrink from any challenge totheir core beliefs, I think they’ll not feel challenged in the least and mayeven dislike it intensely.AC: Just a year after this novel, 2014 saw the release of THE GENUINE,IMITATION, PLATIC KIDNAPPING. This was a far different story, loosely based onyour experiences in New Orleans, offering more of an entertaining than athought-provoking read. Of all the characters in this novel, Cat is easily themost memorable for me and jumps from page. Reading her dialogue was likewitnessing a character reach out of the book and slap me across the face,especially considering how she appears to me as a beacon of hope. Did youintend Cat to be a radiance that cuts through the underbelly of New Orleans inthis novel, as a reminder of a way out? Does Cat know you put her in thisnovel?LE: The portrait of Cat isvery much like the real Cat. I just wanted to remain true to her truly uniquecharacter—in almost every sense she is a singular person. And, I doubt ifshe’ll ever read it—she’s not a reader. Now, if it ever gets made into a movie,I’m in trouble…Cat was sold by her junkymother to the head of the Mafia, Carlos Marcellus, for a hundred bucks when shewas nine or ten. He kicked her out when she reached the age of 12—way too oldfor his tastes. She went down in the Quarters and survived by prostitution andselling drugs and rolling sailors. She just isn’t afraid of anything. Here’s atypical “Cat” story. One Sunday, we were just sitting around our apartment whenout of the blue, she asks me if I wanted to go down to the Quarters to rollsailors. Why not, I said, so she called up another call girl friend, Jackie, ablack girl who lived in the Ninth Ward and we met her down at the Seaport Café.I was there to provide “protection.” Yeah…Well, they hooked up withthis Norwegian sailor and took him back in the little alley that goes to theDungeon and Jackie gave him a blow job. He wanted Cat to do him next, but thegirls demanded payment first. Fuck you, he said, the first thing he’d said inEnglish as he’d been pretending not to speak the language. I was coming towardthem to provide that “protection” when Cat said, Well, fuck you too, and shepulled out her switchblade (which I’d given to her for a birthday present) andstuck it in his stomach. He gave a little sigh and went down. I told Cat tocheck his socks as that’s where I kept my money when I was in the Navy and sureenough, he had wad of bills she grabbed and we beat feet. When we got a coupleof blocks away and ducked into a bar, Cat started to divvy up the money but gotreally pissed off. Except for a twenty, it was all Norwegian money. Fuckingfunny money she said, and told Jackie to keep it all. We never found out if theguy was dead or not. Lots of things like that never make the paper. Ifeverything like that made the paper, the tourist business would dry up.The next Sunday Cat asked meif I wanted to go back into the Quarters with her and Jackie, and I told hershe’d have to go without her “protection.” Fuck that happy shit…AC: The setting in this novel also really stuck out to me. Thedescriptions Pete provides to develop the layout and scents of New Orleansstuck me right alongside him in his criminal attempts. How did living in NewOrleans stick to you? Did you fall in love with the city in the same way Petedid?LE: I’ve always loved NewOrleans from the time I lived there as a child to when I returned as an adultand lived there many years. It’s a dirty, corrupt, dangerous, gorgeous,bewitching town and so unlike any other city in America. It contains all of theexcesses that are interesting. I can’t imagine anyone ever being bored in TheBig Sleazy.AC: The crux of the novel examines the idea you lay out of the abstractand the real in regards to a million dollars or any large sum of money for akidnapping. Do you find there are other things where the illusion orabstraction doesn’t pan out to what actually happens? This examination of moneyin such a way I found to also extend to a question of Pete’s status as aprivileged ex-baseball player navigating New Orleans in an entirely differentrealm than those who live in dire poverty and straits. Did you anticipate aneconomic disparity to grow between characters? The best example of what I’mreferring to would be in regards to Pete being broke, but saying he never hadto do desperate measures to get food, whereas Cat has been through hell and isstill trying to grow as an individual.LE: First, Pete wasn’t any“privileged ex-ballplayer.” He was stone broke and had been for the last tenyears after he’d been drummed out of baseball. But, he’d always been a hustlerand if you’re a hustler you’re never going to be truly poor. There’s just toomany lames out there to make a buck from. He and Cat were basically the same.She was a call girl and had been a prostitute so she was in the same financialboat as Pete. Both knew how to survive on the street.You very accurately named thecrux of the novel. In a period of my life that I’m ashamed of, I sold lifeinsurance. (Don’t like to reveal that as that was one of the few lame periodsin my life.) The “million dollars on the kitchen table” was the first thing myboss taught me. When you’re trying to sell a million-dollar policy” to someone,he sees it as an abstract thing. It just isn’t real to him. But, if you lay outan actual million dollars in cash, it immediately becomes a very real thing.And, that’s what my manager did. He’d open a suitcase and dump out a millionbucks. Of course, it was just Monopoly money, but seeing that mound ofhundred-dollar bills almost always led to a sale. The same thing happens in akidnapping. Up until the money’s laid out on the kitchen table it’s largely anabstract, meaningless number. The victim is all gung-ho up to that point to gethis beloved Gladys back, but once he sees that mound of bills, all of a sudden,he has a change of heart. That’s when he calls the cops, the Fibbies. He claimshe loves his honey Gladys, but it’s pretty clear which he loves more…AC: Finally, is the inclusion of the crazed inmate a sly reference to THERAPIST? Or just a minor re-examination of a similar element?LE: Pretty sharp, Anthony!Yep. Same character. He’s based on a guy I met in the New Orleans jail and whathe did is what the real guy did. I just like the guy…AC: Where did you take your inspiration to tell stories from? When youwere a younger man, did you find yourself always being the one in a group toentertain others with amusing stories?LE: My inspiration mostlycomes from my own life. I’ve purposely put myself in situations where both goodand bad things can happen. A lot of them were bad but those were the ones Igravitated toward the most. Graham Greene said writers have a piece of ice intheir hearts. What Greene is referring to is the art of detachment from theemotional to be able to observe an event and describe it accurately anddispassionately. It’s what allows us to write dramatically instead ofmelodramatically. It is simply the ability to maintain alertness and keep yourown emotions at bay when describing events, especially events that carryemotion personally. It’s not “coldness” or “calculating observation” as somewould say. It’s simply maintaining the reporter’s stance when writing drama soas to maintain the drama and not tip over into melodrama. Having that piece ofice in our hearts is what allows the good writer to lower the volume instead ofraising it. Thereby creating true and deep emotion and not surface emotion,cheaply and easily wrought. That melodramatic writer is who Oscar Wilde wasreferring to in his famous criticism of that most melodramatic writer of alltime, Charles Dickens, when he said, “One must have a heart of stone to readthe death of little Nell without laughing.” Indeed.And, yes, I was that guy whotook over the conversation. I had (have) a desperate need to hold the floor.Mostly to “play the dozens” which is a disappearing art because of thatpolitical correctness bullshit. It’s probably lack of a healthy ego—I find Ineed constant confirmation that I have value—laughter and grins being the coinof that realm.AC: Do you believe there is a power books and written word is able tohold other mediums of expression lack?LE: Certainly! I subscribeto Marshall McLuhan’s theory of hot and cold media. The media is judged by theextent of the audience’s participation. In hot media, the audience is passivelyconsuming what is presented. In cool media, the audience has to activelyanalyze and interpret what is presented to make sense of what they see andhear.Hot media are those thataffect one sense and the participant is required to bring their imaginationsand stored knowledge to bear to have a good experience. Examples of hot mediaare books and radio. Cool media is media that affects two or more senses,leaving less for the participant to bring to the experience. An example of coldmedia is television. By utilizing more than one sense, much of the work is donefor the participant; therefore, one’s participation is minimal. You sit backand let the media do all the heavy lifting.Experiencing a televisionshow requires little from the participant who remains passive. Reading a bookis a participatory exercise in which one has to do some of the work. Therefore,reading a book is a more intense experience as the reader has to bring to bearthe whole of his imagination, memory and intellect. And, when the participantis required to do some work in order to make full use of the experience, itbecomes his or hers and he or she “owns” the interpretation of it. This isprecisely what philosophers and educators are referring to when they decry “thedumbing down of America.” That’s because watching television does very little toaffect the mind. And that’s the power of books over other mediums.AC: How do you describe your role as a writer?LE: I have several duties asa writer. One is to write entertaining stories to the best of my ability.Another is to always write as honestly as I am able to—my mantra is, “If it’sfiction, it has to be true.” That doesn’t mean being detail-true but it meansmy personal mandate is that fiction be written honestly and not shirkinganything in that fiction that intentionally misleads or lies to the reader. Mymain duty over everything is to write the best fiction I am capable of and tonever take short cuts or offer up anything that is in any way less than I amcapable of. That is my stock in trade and I hope never to write anything thatdoesn’t reflect an honest and true heart. AC: What lessons would you have to impart on younger authors?LE: I’ll steal this from JimHarrison, if you want to become a writer read the whole of western literaturefor the past 400 years. If you live long enough, read the whole of easternliterature for the same period. For, if you don’t know what passed for good inthe past, how can you know what’s considered good in the present.AC: What projects are you currently working on? Which book are you mostproud of?LE: I’m working on about tenprojects currently. Working on three short stories for various anthologies I’vebeen invited to submit to. Have four novels I’m working on. I’m writing a newcraft book. Am preparing notes for appearances at several writing events I’vebeen invited to present at. For instance, I’m appearing at Lee Lofland’sWriter’s Police Academy where he’s scheduled me to give at least two talks. I’mpreparing notes for those so it will appear that I’m talking extemporaneously.And, the other day he asked me if I’d serve as the auctioneer for an auctionthey hold, so of course I have to do research so I won’t look too much as adoofus. That means I have to watch episodes of Storage Wars so I can learn howto be an auctioneer. Us writer types have to have many skills…I’m working on two mainprojects—a new novel titled HARD TIMESbased on a short story of that same title. And, my memoir, titled AdrenalineJunkie, which has been a true labor of love and one in which I don’t dodgeanything, but include both the best and the worst of my life. It’s the book I’m most excited about and hope when it comes out it’ll beviewed as the best work of my life. I’ve had several publishers want it, butI’m waiting for a Legacy 5 publisher so that it might end up on bookshelves andbe available for reviewers reviewsby the best reviewers.There are two books I’m theproudest of: THE RAPIST and THE BITCH.Fans who wouldlike to reach out to Edgerton can email him at butchedgerton@comcast.net.

{"title": "ME AND CHARLIE MANSON...", "date": "Friday, November 17, 2017", "text": "Hi folks,I just learned that Charlie Manson has just achieved room temperature. In honor of the occasion, I'm repeating a blogpost I wrote a few years ago about Charlie and me. Hope you get a kick out of it.Hi folks,I thought you might be interested ina recent exchange I had with author Richard Godwin. Richard is interviewing mefor his blog feature “Chin Wag at the Slaughterhouse.” It’s a fantasticfeature, where he interviews authors and asks the most fascinating and“deepest” questions I’ve ever been asked by any interviewer. Richard isinterviewing me at the suggestion of noir master, Paul D. Brazill, a mutualfriend.Richard conducts his interviews byposing one question at a time. Once you respond to that question, he sends youanother. It’s an exhausting process but when we’re done, it’ll be the mostcomprehensive interview I’ve ever had the pleasure of participating in. I’ll besure to let you know when it appears.I had just sent him my replay to hissecond question and he sent me the third. When he emailed me, he asked me thequestion below and I thought you might be interested in the answer, since it’sabout an old acquaintance, Charlie Manson, and I know there are people outthere who are interested in Manson. (This isn’t the interview question—it’sjust a personal question he asked in response to Paul Brazill’s suggestion thathe do so.)Be advised there are a few instances of strong language.Here’s Richard Godwin’s question andmy reply:Paul (D. Brazill) suggested I askyou about Manson. I do not mean to put you on the spot, this is not part of theinterview. My first novel Apostle Rising was mentioned by a few reviewers inthe context of the Manson killings, as this review showshttp://www.bookgeeks.co.uk/2011/03/23/apostle-rising-by-richard-godwin/All the bestRichard (Godwin).HiRichard,Well,Charlie and I have a bit of a history.Aboutten years ago or so, a professor at the University of Toledo—Dr. RussellRiesling--was writing a book about the drug experiences of famous people duringtheir youth. He had folks like Big Brother of Big Brother and the HoldingCompany and some other folks. For some weird reason, he had a chapter on me.I’d done drugs but definitely wasn’t famous!Anyway,Russ interviewed me for his book (which hasn’t been published yet, alas), andwe became friends. I sent him a copy of my story collection, Monday’s Meal. About two weeks after Isent it, I got a phone call from him. Seems he’d been out to Corcoran Prison tovisit with and interview Charles Manson (who also had a chapter), and duringthe visit, Charlie spotted the copy of Monday’sMeal that Russ had with him. He asked if he could “borrow it” and Russloaned it to him. A few days later, he called Russ and was really excited(according to Russ). He said he’d read the book and loved it and that I was “thereal deal” meaning a real-life outlaw, ex-con. He asked Russ if he’d ask me ifI’d mind if he (Charlie) called me. I told Russ, sure, and thus began a seriesof phone calls from him to me.Now,when I was in prison, we weren’t allowed to call folks. At all. One of the manythings that have changed. Because of that, I wasn’t aware that all such phonecalls are made collect. At the end of the month, after which he called 3-4times a week, I got the bill and it was astronomical! My wife had a cow and Itold Charlie we needed to dial it back a bit. (Pun intended…)Mostly,Charlie talked and I listened. He’s not hard to figure out. He’s a nutcase,pure and simple. Knew lots of guys like him in the joint who just weren’t asfamous. We swapped stories and he may have told me a few things he’d done thathe hadn’t been nailed on and I may have returned in kind, but I won’t talkabout that. Anyway, I kind of got tired of talking to him—it was same-o, same-oall the time—and was about to disassociate myself, when he told me hiscellmate, Roger Smith, really wanted to talk to me. I said okay and thus begana series of phone calls with Roger.Rogerbills himself as the “most-stabbed inmate in U.S. history—and he is. As of thattime, he’d been shanked over 300 separate times. The reason he was Charlie’scellmate was that both were in protective custody as there were hits out onboth of them from just about everybody in Corcoran. Over the years, Roger hadhired himself out as a hit man for every single gang in the joint and now allof them had a hit out on him. The reason he wanted to connect with me was thathe thought I was a “great writer” (his words and they had little effect onme—I’ve been on the receiving end of a shuck job attempt more than once…), andhe wanted me to write his life story. According to Roger, he’d had his “come toJesus” moment and wanted to right all the wrongs in his life. He said he wantedhis life story out there to help keep young kids from following in hisfootsteps. He’d been locked up ever since he was a juvie and all that. Grew upin one joint or another.Ihad to laugh when he told me he was “saved.” He sounded contrite… but everyother word out of his mouth with “fuck this” or “motherfucker this” and hedidn’t sound much like the converts I’d met down at the First Baptist… But,I’ve been inside with a lot of guys who had these jailhouse conversions and hewasn’t unusual.Hetold me Charlie was letting him use his personal secretary—some gal who livesin North or South Carolina (forget which) who has all of Charlie’s journals andcommunications and writings and such and who handles all his commercialbusiness. He can’t profit by books and interviews but he does take checks fromthe networks and publishers and the proceeds all go to charity. Roger told mehe’d kept journals from when he was a little tad tyro outlaw and they were withCharlie’s secretary and he said he’d have her send them to me—from what hesaid, a LOT of journals(!)--and that he’d answer any questions I asked.Itold him I was just too busy with my own work and really couldn’t do thisproject, but he wouldn’t take no for an answer. Called me incessantly, tryingto persuade me to write his life history. Finally, one time, he said, “What’sthe real reason you don’t want to write it, Les?” I asked him if he wanted thereal reason and he said yeah, so I told him. “Roger,” I said, “you’re like aserial killer. In fact, you are aserial killer. Three hundred hits, dude.” “Yeah,” he said. “and why would thatprevent you from writing my story?” To which I answered that serial killers justflat-out bored me (and they do). I told him serial killers just keep doing thesame exact thing, over and over and over, ad nauseum. After about the thirdone, they’re just boring. And, I didn’t want to tie up a year of my life onwriting about some boring-ass serial killer.Therewas a silence and then he exploded. Called me everything but a white man.Sounded kind of like he’d kind of backslid on the “saved” deal. Screamed thatif he ever got out of Corcoran my house was the first place he was heading. Ilistened to him ranting and screaming at me and then said, “Roger?” He gotquiet and then said, “Yeah?” I said, “Roger, you’re not ever getting out ofthere unless there’s a major earthquake and that isn’t likely. But, if somehowyou do get out, I’m aware that you prefer using a shank on your hits and if youcome to my house to nail me, I won’t have a shank. It’ll be something thatmakes a louder noise. So, it’s been nice talking to you and have a nice life,loser.”Andthat’s the last I’ve talked to either Roger or Charlie. But, for awhile we wereall jam.Sothat’s the story of me and Charlie Manson, Richard.Hopeyou enjoyed this little anecdote, folks. And, if you haven’t read RichardGodwin’s books you really should. They’re fantastic.Here’sa link to his latest, Mr. Glamour.

{"title": "COUPLE OF BLURBS...", "date": "Wednesday, November 15, 2017", "text": "Hi folks,I'm pleased to present a couple of blurbs today--one for a writer I admire very much and another which was given to one of my books.The first is what I wrote about Earl Javorsky's newest novel, DOWN TO NO GOOD. Here's what I have to say about this terrific book:ORDER HEREBlurbfor Earl Javorsky’s DOWN TO NO GOODHandme a book with a P.I. who’s been shot in the head and come back from the dead,along with a psychic who solves crimes right and left, along with some otherfolks who are more than a bit irregular and I’m unplugging the TV, turning offthe alarm clock, and hiding my phone under a pillow where I can’t hear it.

{"title": "JUST LIKE THAT REISSUED!", "date": "Monday, October 30, 2017", "text": "Hi folks,Got some news--Down and Out Books has just reissued my novel, JUST LIKE THAT! It has a new cover which I really like. If you haven't read it before you might want to glom onto a copy now. It's about 85% autobiographical and is centered on a road trip I made with a rappie from Pendleton and on my time in the joint.Assistant Warden Cathy Johns of The Farm (Louisiana state joint at Angola) read it and told me it was \"the truest account of the criminal mind\" she'd ever read. One thing I promise--you won't see any bullshit about \"shivs\" or any crap like the myth MSNBC puts out about prisons in it...Hope you get a copy and hope you enjoy the read.

{"title": "A COUPLE OF OPENINGS IN OUR ONLINE NOVEL-WRITING CLASS", "date": "Friday, October 13, 2017", "text": "Hifolks,Asmost of you know, I run an online novel writing class that runs for ten weeksat a time and is in operation year-round. We’re coming up to the end of thecurrent session this week, and then will take a couple of weeks off and then beginthe next session on October 29. Most times, we don’t have openings for newclass members, but it looks as if we’re going to have a couple of openings thistime, so I just want to let folks know in case anyone’s interested. If you are,please send me an email at butchedgerton@comcast.netand let me know. Below, I’ll give an outline of how it works. When new openingsoccur, first chance to join is given to the adjuncts and after that it’s afirst-come, first-served basis. To be able to devote the proper time to eachstudent, the class will be limited to twelve people. An unlimited number ofadjuncts are taken.Me and Joe Lansdale in Indy after a meal...AuditorsThoseinterested in auditing the class—which would allow the auditing person toreceive and view everything the rest of the class does, but not be able toparticipate actively, solely as an observer. The fee is substantially less forauditors than participating students at $50. Basically, auditors will sit in onthe class as an observer. There can be an unlimited number of auditors. Some inclass are uncomfortable with very many observing their work and our exchangesas, to be honest, many of our comments are brutally frank. Students know andwelcome this, but to someone not directly participating can see it another way.There won’t be any interaction at all with auditors—they’ll be there simply touse the knowledge they might pick up for their own writing or even their ownteaching.Pertinent infofor active class members:Thisclass will be conducted in a workshop format. What that means is each weekparticipants will send a designated number of pages to both me and the othermembers of the class. When I receive each person’s work, I’ll providecomments/criticism/suggestions to improve for each student on their work andthen send it back to them and the others in class. Each person in class doesthe same for each other—reading and providing comments on each other’s work andsending that back to the class and me. The class is divided into two groups soeach person will need to read and comment on 5-6 people’s work. That doesn’tmean they can’t read work from those in the other group—anyone can read anyoneelse’s work. This is just to keep each member’s work down to a reasonablelevel. It’s exactly like being in an “on-ground” workshop. I’ve found over alifetime of teaching classes—beginning with the UCLA Writer’s Program—that thisis the single best method of learning. There is a synergy at work with thismodel. Many writing classes consist of the student sending work in and theinstructor commenting. That’s okay, in a limited way, but when you have tenothers plus the instructor or workshop leader commenting, the value of theclass increases almost exponentially.Ibelieve in road maps when embarking on the lengthy journey a novel entails;therefore, I ask each student to submit a 15-20 word outline of their proposed novel. I don’t have the space hereto explain how that works, but I send a handout on how to create such anoutline before the class begins, and it serves to keep the writer focused ontheir novel throughout its creation and also helps the workshop leader and his/herclassmates see instantly if the writer is focused or meandering. I’m a firmbeliever in beginning a novel in the proper place and once that is achieved,the remainder of the novel becomes infinitely easier to create. We’ll spend themost time on a writer’s novel beginning than any other part of their novel.Thisclass will be composed of students who’ve previously taken classes with mealong with newcomers. To be able to serve each level of student fairly,students who are well along into their novel and have taken previous classes,will be able to submit up to eight pages per week. New students who haven’ttaken my class, will be allowed to submit up to four pages per week untilthey’ve achieved a publishable opening, and, once they’ve achieved a properbeginning, will then be able to send eight pages each week thereafter. Pleaseknow that this may sound like favoritism, but it’s not at all. The beginning ofa novel is the single most crucial part of writing a novel, imo, and I spendmore time on that than anything else. I’ve learned over many years, that agreat many writers have a poor understanding of a novel’s structure and it’scrucial that a sound knowledge of novel structure (particularly beginnings) beachieved before devoting much time to the rest of the novel. I’ll spend as muchtime on the newer student’s four pages than I will on the more experiencedwriter’s. Please feel free to query those in class who’ve been with me beforeas to their opinion and I feel certain they’ll agree with me. I’ll be happy tofurnish names and email addresses for those writers should you wish to asktheir opinion.Periodically,I also send handouts to the class on some element of writing, as well as otherpertinent info that’s useful.Beforewarned that this workshop isn’t for the faint of heart! Some have termed it“Les Edgerton’s Bootcamp for Writers.” In “real life” I’m not a mean person,but with writing I’m not going to hold hands nor hand out false praise. That’swhat writing groups are for and they do it well. I expect each person toparticipate fully and comment on each other’s work just as they would wantothers to do the same for theirs. I don’t tolerate very well, those who keepmaking the same mistakes week after week. For example, the proper andprofessional format is explained at the beginning and each class there arealways one or two newcomers who keep making the same, easily-fixed mistake.Here’s a common example: One of the format rules is that there is only onespace between sentences in computer-generated material. Many older writers, inthe typewriter days of yore, were taught to use two spaces. The kernaling incomputers is different than typewriters and using two spaces is a sure sign ofan amateur who hasn’t kept up with current usages and just another red flag awriter ought to avoid. I understand it’s a hard habit to overcome—I had to dothe same myself—but there is an easy way to relearn this which we give, andeven if it takes awhile to relearn this, a writer can at least do a final editbefore sending work in and correct this. To not do so, indicates to me a writerwho doesn’t respect either themselves or their fellow writers or the teacher.Frankly, I don’t want to waste time with this type of writer. I’m not speakingof the writer who makes occasional mistakes, but of the one who continuallykeeps making the same mistake after it’s been pointed out.Writingwell isn’t easy. It’s hard. If someone has told you that writing is easy,they’ve lied to you. Typing is easy; writing is hard. Our aim in our class isto help writers create publishable work. By reputable publishers, not vanitypresses.IfI haven’t scared you off, here are the particulars:1.Fee is $400, payable in advance and nonrefundable. Auditor’s fee is $50 and isalso nonrefundable.2.Each week, you’ll send to the entire group and me, your pages. You’ll alsoreceive work from your classmates to read and provide comments on. The commentsaren’t intended to be scholarly or exhibit some high degree of technicalknowledge. We just want to know what worked for you in the writing and whatdidn’t and why you think it did or didn’t.3.To help make the class run smoothly, there will be deadlines each week. Forinstance, if the class begins on a Sunday each week, you’ll send in your workby the following Wednesday. Then, starting on Thursday, you’ll send in yourcomments on each other’s work. I’ll send my comments to each of you by Saturdaynight. Then, the next week begins on the following Sunday.4.Often, the class and I kind of hit a wall. It’s pretty intense. To account forthat event, we may take a week hiatus and return the following week. In fact,you can pretty well count on that.5.We don’t expect a student to be a professional writer at all. It’s a class, notan advanced degree program. Our aim is to help each writer become better attheir craft as a result of the class, and to learn how to professionally submitmaterial, and to hopefully end up creating work that is publishablelegitimately.6.While I would never say I would recommend students to agents or publishers,very often I do. The people who finish the class almost always have progressedto the point where their work is, indeed, publishable, and when that happensI’m eager to introduce them and their work to gatekeepers.7.Required reading will be my book, HOOKED, and Jack Bickham’s book, SCENES &STRUCTURE. Recommended reading will be Janet Burroway’s WRITING FICTION.Ifanyone is interested and has more questions, please feel free to email me at butchedgerton@comcast.net.Thankyou,LesP.S.Some additional info…We’ll have a couple of new studentsthis time—most writers keep re-upping each time but occasionally one or twowill drop out for various reasons: demands of a new job not allowing them tocommit the considerable time that is required to participate, needing time offto address the notes their new agent just gave them for the novel he signed, andso on. Most just keep on, even after they’ve gotten an agent and/or sold theirnovel, and begin writing a new one. Almost all who stick out the entire sessioncome back. The ones who quit usually quit fairly soon into the class. It’s notfor everyone. Nobody holds anybody’s hand and every single one of us is focusedon but one thing—helping each other write a novel that’s publishable. It’s atough game and not for everyone.I try to warn people who arethinking of joining us, how tough the class is, but I know from past experiencethat even so forewarned, at least some are going to be in for a shock when theysee that we really don’t hold hands, pat people on the back for minimumefforts, or overlook writing that doesn’t work. I’m not cruel (at least I don’tthink so) nor are any of the oldtimers in class, but most new folks haven’tbeen exposed to a class like ours. The truth is, most writers who haven’t had aclass like ours has been praised in other classes or most likely, has been inclasses that use the “sandwich” method of teaching. You know—that deal wherethe teach applies a bit of praise, then a bit of criticism, and then a bit ofpraise. Well, that ain’t our shtick. Not even close. The comments we allprovide on everyone’s work fit one definition only. They’re honest.This isn’t to be mean or to act likewe’re the only folks around who know what good writing is. Except… we do. I’mnot aware of any other class out there with the kind of track record oursenjoys. Virtually every writer who stays the course with us ends up with a topagent and/or a book deal. That doesn’t happen in a single ten-week session.About the earliest anyone has earned an agent or book deal in our class hasbeen about a year. And, that’s reasonable.The thing is, our writers don’texpect things to be easy.Here are a few comments by students:Hi ________. Since Les opened thefloor for comments from the \"class veterans\" I'm chipping in with mytwo cents. I have a file cabinet filled with stuff I sent Les and then neededasbestos gloves to take the paper off the printer. When I started this journey,I'd never taken an English class past high school. (I was pre-med in college) Ifigured I love to read, so how hard can it be? Okay, quit laughing at me.Clearly, when I wrote my first version of my first novel, I had no idea aboutstory structure, POV, any of that. I figured I'm pretty articulate andtherefore I can write?Les quickly set me straight. All ofthis is to point out that we've all been on the receiving end of Les' brutalhonesty. I will find some of the comments he made on my work and post them butphrases like \"throwing up in my mouth now\" and \"bury this sodeep in the yard no one ever finds it\" are seared into my brain and Idon't have to look to find those!!! The point is, I took other classes before Imet Les and the teachers were kind and gentle and never told me I sucked. If itweren't for Les, I'd still be churning out awful drivel that makes people wantto throw up instead of trying not to throw up while I wait to see if my agentis able to sell my book. I would never have gotten an agent without Les. Sohang in there. Listen to everything he says and if it doesn't make sense, askaway.The novel that I am currently tryingto sell has been a work in progress since 2009. The first time Les saw it hesent it back and told me to re-write the WHOLE thing!!! My character was awimp. She sat back and let things happen to her. I argued a little, rewrote alittle and then moved on to another book. After a year, I went back and rereadit and saw the truth. It was awful. So I took a deep breath and started over.Page one. First sentence. Re-wrote the entire thing. It took a full year andthen I revised it again. It's definitely a process. But once you get theInciting incident and the outline steps down pat, it's a whole lot easier.Trust me!!! And you'll never graduate completely. A few months ago, Les and Iwent head-to-head on one single passage. I was trying to be lazy and take theeasy way out. He called me on it and I resubmitted three or four weeks in arow, revisions on the same passage. I was sure my classmates were so sick of itthey were going to stick needles in their eyes rather than read it again! Butin the end, the passage rocked!! So hang in there!!!! It'll get better.That’s all, folks…"},

{"title": "Another of our classmates sells her book!", "date": "Sunday, September 3, 2017", "text": "Hi folks,I love being able to report ongreat news like this. Yet another of our classmates in my online novel-writingclass has sold her first book! This is the second one this year, following ToddMonohan’s success story earlier in the year when he sold his first novel, The Vexing Heirloom.Welcome the world of publishednovelists, Linda Thompson, with her magnificent book titled, The Plum Blooms in Winter, to bepublished by Mountain Brook Ink.Here. I’ll let Linda make the announcementin her own words as she did via an email to me yesterday when I asked her fordetails.She said:Hi, Les!Yes yes YES, it’s true!! Sorry, I HAVE beenmeaning to write you… because I’m deeply, deeply in your debt—no one has meantmore to my writing career than you have!I have a three-book deal! The Plum Blooms inWinter is supposed to launch in January 2019, and I’m contracted fortwo more books after that.  I’m delighted to work with the team at Mountain Brook Ink. They produce outstanding books. Given that it took me six years to writebook one, I am kind of nervous about having just 15 months to deliver book two.Granted, I’ve been well schooled now– I sure had a lot to learn when I startedout! But I know I need to get really serious about my daily word count goals.And as always, there’s a lot of “life” going down, so it’s a challenge tobalance everything.Yes, please give a big shout-out to everyone inclass, who’ve been so amazingly helpful in this process! And to yourself—Ireally do owe anything I’ve achieved as a writer to you.Much love, LindaAnd much love to you, Linda! It wasLinda who found and arranged for our class’s site on the Intergnat, and who hasmaintained it for us for the past six years. She’s been one of our mostfaithful class members, showing up each and every week to send us her work andto provide her commentary on her fellow classmate’s work each and every week.She began with me when I taught the novel-writing class for Phoenix College wayback when and came with me when I began our current class six years ago. She’sfamily!Even though it took her six yearsto write her first book, it has nothing to do with her being a slow writer. Onthe contrary—it’s taken this long only because she’s a perfectionist. She hasalways made sure every word was the right word and she is a throwback towriters of yore—she has rewritten every page of her book until it was, indeed,perfect. That’s rare today in the modern world of people of little patience anda proclivity for instant gratification. Linda is a writer’s writer and that’sthe highest compliment I am able to give. There are more than a couple morelike Linda in our class and like her, their day will come, too.A three-book deal is becoming arare event in publishing, especially for a first-time novelist. I suspect theydidn’t see her first book as what normally crosses their desk from first-timenovelists—Linda just approaches her craft with the kind of care and attentionthat’s more associated with a generation known for their attention to craft.When the publication day comes, I’llbe sure to post it here. It’s going to be a big book—that I can promise!Blue skies,LesTaken last year on a visit to Scottsdale to visit my best fiend, Tom Rough and got to spend a day with a couple of our Bootcamp for Writers. On my right is one of our most esteemed graduates. Maegan Beaumont. and on my left is today's star--Linda Thompson.P.S. Update on Todd Monahan! I gotan email from him the same day I got Linda’s. Here’s what Todd had to report—more excitingnews! I’d asked him about a  report thathis first novel was being considered as a possible film.Les!Great to hear from you,and I hope your recovery is progressing. Through a mutual relative,I was put in touch with a woman who works in Hollywood, as a contact and possibleconduit to a studio that might be interested in the project. She wrote me aletter, which I posted on Facebook, saying that she likes the book, but that itwould be a hard sell because it's not an established brand yet. But, she said,if the right producer/director comes along, she thinks it would be perfect forscreen treatment. So that's pretty much where I'm at.On another positivenote, I am about 4/5 done with my next novel and I'm looking at a Summer 2018release. It was originally intended to be a YA coming of age novella(think \"Stand By Me\" meets \"A Christmas Story\") but theproject has grown and changed to the point I think it will be marketable toadults, too.Another funny thing: afew weeks ago, my publisher asked me to review a potential author's manuscriptand give critique, much like we do in your class. The woman has ability but thestory was nonexistent, structurally, and needed a lot of work. I tried toexplain the concepts as you taught me, of surface problem, story-worthyproblem, inciting incident, etc. She got very angry, told me I didn't know whatI was talking about, and pulled the project from us. Just underscores that noteveryone is ready to hear the truth. I am glad I had you for a teacher.How have you been? Howis the class and how are the other writers?ToddTodd G. MonahanAttorney-at-LawCool news, Todd, and we’re glad wehad you for a classmate as well! As you can see, your classmates are doingwell. Several more have finished their novels and we’ll be posting more successstories in the near future."},

Click hereTwenty years afterthe publication of his first short story collection, Monday’s Meal, LesEdgerton delivers the goods once again in this collection of harrowing tales ofoutlaws, ex-cons, frightened men and women, rap-partners throwing back tallboys and taller tales, children forced to become killers, stabbings andshootings, bad asses and sad asses…a wide-ranging collection of distinct andmemorable characters who will exhibit a kind of wisdom not obtainable from thehalls of academia. This is not a gathering of people contemplating their navelsbut real people facing the consequences of their actions…and it ain’t oftenpretty.Praise for Les Edgerton…“Les Edgerton has swiftly become my favorite crime writer.Original voice, uncompromising attitude and a pure hardboiled style leap him tothe front ranks of my reading list. He will become legendary.” —Joe R.Lansdale, author of Paradise Sky, The Bottoms, Edge of Dark Water, The Thicket,and the Hap and Leonard series, the books behind the TV series of the samename, and many others.“Reading Les Edgerton’s stories is like listening to thoseold World War II broadcasts from the London blitz, with the reporter crouchingunder a restaurant table, microphone in hand, while the bombs drop on the cityand the ceiling caves in. Edgerton reports on the world and the news is notgood. There’s a kind of wacky wisdom in these bulletins from the underside oflife; the stories are full of people you hope never move in next door, for whomordinary life is an impossible dream. This is good fiction; Edgerton writeslean and nasty prose.” —Dr. Francois Camoin, Director, Graduate School ofEnglish, University of Utah and author of Benbow and Paradise, Like Love, ButNot Exactly, Deadly Virtues, The End of the World Is Los Angeles and Why MenAre Afraid of Women.“Les Edgerton is the new High King of Noir.” —Ken Bruen,author of The Emerald Lie, The Guards, Pimp, and many others.For MONDAY’S MEALThe sad wives,passive or violent husbands, parolees, alcoholics and other failures in LeslieH. Edgerton's short-story collection are pretty miserable people. And yetmisery does have its uses. Raymond Carver elevated the mournful complaints of thedisenfranchised in his work, and Edgerton makes an admirable attempt to do thesame. He brings to this task an unerring ear for dialogue and a sure-handedsense of place (particularly New Orleans, where many of the stories are set).Edgerton has affection for even his most despicablecharacters—\"boring\" Robert, who pours scalding water over hissleeping wife in \"The Last Fan\"; Jake, the musician responsible forhis own daughter's death in \"The Jazz Player\"; and Tommy in 'IShoulda Seen a Credit Arranger,\" whose plan to get hold of some moneyinvolves severing the arm of a rich socialite—but he never takes the readerpast the brink of horrible fascination into a deeper understanding. In the beststory, \"My Idea of a Nice Thing,\" a woman named Raye tells us why shedrinks: \"My job. I'm a hairdresser. See, you take on all of these otherpeople's personalities and troubles and things, 10 or 12 of 'em a day, and whenthe end of the day comes, you don't know who you are anymore. It takes threedrinks just to sort yourself out again.\" Here Edgerton grants both thereader and Raye the grace of irony, and without his authorial intrusion, wefind ourselves caring about her predicament.—Denise Gess. The New YorkTimes Book Review, November 16, 1997Hope you enjoy theread! If you do, please consider leaving a review on Amazon and/or Goodreads.That’s probably the best thing a reader can do for a writer they like. I’dreally appreciate your support!Blue skies,Les"},
{"title": "Example of how our online novel-writing class works...", "date": "Wednesday, June 7, 2017", "text": "Hi folks,I’m posting a long post today. It’sa good example of my teaching method and my hope is that by reading it, thewriters out there in Blogland, will perhaps see some of their own writing thatmay hopefully be assisted a bit by looking at the work and journey of a fellowwriter.These exchanges were writtenbetween Todd Monahan and I and after the Skype class, Todd enrolled in ouronline novel-writing class where he finished his terrific novel, The Vexing Heirloom.From Todd Monahan, in the SkypeNew York Writer’s online class conducted by Les Edgerton and Jenny Milchman.The following is a series of interchanges between Todd and Les during thecourse of the class. My comments are bolded and Todd’s are in plain text.(From Todd) Good afternoon, all,Here is my attempt at the outline. Inciting Incident: Hilarion discovers medallion This may work if it creates a problem that is clear to him at the timeof the discovery.Development1) Hilarion decides to seek treasureWhich finding the medallion and the ensuing problem that creates tells him heneeds to do, I assume?2) Hilarion leads people through challenges3) Guillermina wrests control from HilarionResolution: Hilarion defeats Guillermina, reveals \"treasure\" That looks like the win, but you also needa loss.My novel is the first in a proposed series, so this Resolution is much moretriumph than defeat.  If I had to explain how it is also a defeat, itwould take more than a few words.  It is a triumph in that Hilariondiscovers the \"treasure\" (not a physical treasure at all but arediscovery of his people's heritage and identity) and leads his people tosafety from Cuba to Florida, but it is also a defeat in that he has initiated amuch deeper ideological battle for the soul of his people against  Guillermina, whose values differ greatly fromHilarion's. Problem with this, Todd, isthat you’re stating it in grandiose terms and not in individual terms. A novelis about an individual and a personal problem. Wars and rebellions and all thatare simply the setting/backdrop against the individual’s struggle, but it’s theindividual that matters. It also doesn’t matter if a novel is part of a seriesof three or even thirty novels. Each novel needs to stand on its own and followstory convention, and that means the resolution needs to show a character arcand that means there has to be a definite win and a definite loss. On theindividual protagonist’s level, not some amorphous “people.”Moreover, based on concerns expressed by Jenny in my last online course, I amincreasingly afraid my novel is too long.  If it’s more than say 100,000 words, probablyso. So, grudgingly, I am probably going to have to break it in half. Inthat case, the first book is going to have to emphasize a plot that would havebeen a subplot had the novel remained the original length.  That subplotdeals with Hilarion and the Silver Man, a demonic figure seeking revenge on himfor betraying the other bandits with whom Hilarion was passing time when thenovel began.  This does not do violence to the story-worthy problem--theSWP is the M'Brai people's Has to beHilarion’s SWP, not anyone else’s and certainly not some group’s.  need to understand their identity/heritage,and Hilarion's initial problem and inciting incident grow out of hispersonal moral shortcomings Can’twork. as a microcosm of those of his people. This is all gobbly-gook, I’m afraid, Todd. You’re posing this in termsof groups of people, i.e., “the story-worthy problem is the M”Brai people’sneed to understand their identity/heritage,” and that isn’t what a story-worthyproblem is all. It belongs to your protagonist not some “people,” and is anindividual, psychological problem. Not some grandiose theme of “a people’sheritage” or some similar muckamuck. A novel is about one person with oneproblem. Doesn’t matter what the backdrop is or if there’s a cast ofthousands—it’s about one person and one problem and his/her struggle to resolvea clear problem. Period.Plus,novels aren’t based on “morality.” This is a lit professor’s idea of literatureand not a writer’s.Inciting Incident: Hilarion discovers medallionDevelopment1) Silver Man chases Hilarion2) Hilarion leads people through challenges, fleeing Silver Man3) Hilarion resolves to face Silver ManResolution: Hilarion defeats Silver Man but is deposed, abducted Not sure what this outline is for—yoursecond novel? Also, your resolution represents the surface problem resolutionbut not the more important one—the story-worthy problem.I don't want to cut against the grain of the course, but I should point out thatI developed my story using the structure described in The Anatomy of Story byJohn Truby.  Basically, the Truby method holds that a story grows out of asingle designing principle, and is a series of moral decisions the hero/heroinemust navigate in order to reveal and then overcome some fatal weakness and needthe character starts out with.  It is difficult to restate this in the3-Act structure.  I am happy to expound on this, if anyone wants.You’renot cutting against the grain at all, Todd. Truby simply employs slightlydifferent terms. A “single designing principle” is just another term for a“story problem.” I would take issue with the terms “hero” and “villain” asthose don’t exist in good literature. That terminology leads to creatingone-dimensional, cartoon characters, ala Dudly Doright and Snidely Whiplash.Also, novels aren’t based on morality. Not at all. Like Samuel Goldwyn said(badly paraphrased) to the wannabe screenwriter: “Don’t send me a script with amessage. Send me a story. If you want to send a message, use Western Union.Their business is messages. Ours is story-telling.” The“fatal weakness” is basically the story-worthy problem—just expressed insomewhat fuzzier terms. And, if a novel can’t be expressed in terms of thethree-act structure… then it isn’t a novel. This is the basic form of story. Abeginning (inciting incident), a middle (the struggle to resolve the storyproblem), and an end (the resolution of the story problem.). If this isn’there, then it’s not a novel.Onething I’ll mention. I weigh in against English teachers somewhat (that’s beingironical…) in my writing books. Not all Englishteachers or lit profs… but a lot of ‘em. The reason is, many are so invested inwhat they learned, that they just keep passing the same bad and archaic info onto their students and they in turn do the same to their students and in turn…The reason is, it takes many years and lots of classes and all that to learnall this stuff and they’ve got a huge investment in time and energy. It’s mucheasier to just keep parroting the same stuff to generation after generation. Alot of people simply get lazy and don’t want to acknowledge that the languagechanges and so do the ways stories are created or told. As an example, it’smuch easier to tell the class that William Faulkner is a great writer andinvented stream-of-consciousness and that one should emulate him when learningto write stream-of-consciousness. They don’t stop to figure that, yes, Faulknerwas the co-creator of s.o.c., but that he’s currently… room temperature. ThatEnglish is a living, breathing, mutating language. That it changes,continually. That today, Faulkner’s version of stream-of-consciousness isconsidered clunky when compared to today’s practitioners. That a writer such asGordon Lish does the s.o.c. thing much better than Faulkner ever did. ThatMcMann and Erickson do s.o.c. much better in their TV ads than Faulkner did. That’sbecause they’ve benefitted from all the advances we’ve made in writingtechniques and Faulkner hasn’t because… well, because he’s dead. If he werestill living, there’s no doubt he’d once again be the best at it because he wasa genius and all that… but he isn’t alive and writers and the craft have gottenbetter and have passed him by. The point I’m trying to make is that writers aremuch like many of those English teachers—they learn a certain “system” orwhatever and they’ve invested their time and energy (and even money!) into itand they’re loathe to give it up. It represents a significant investment andvery few people want to have to go through all the trouble to learn somethingelse. It’s work and hard work. But, writers will always have to keep relearningto write. It changes. We write in English and not Latin, and we have so manystimuli bombarding us every minute and change is constant and if we aren’taware of those changes and aren’t willing to accept them, we’re pretty muchdoomed to be that writer whose novels are only “available in their room.”JohnGardner who wrote some famous books on writing told his most famous pupil,Raymond Carver, just before Gardner died, to “forget everything I taught youabout writing. It’s all changed and none of what I told you is true any longer.”Gardner was a pretty smart cookie and he was exactly right. It had changed andsignificantly since his books were published. (Even though there are still somepointy-headed profs still raving about his books and recommending them to theirstudents…) If Gardner were still alive and writing writer’s how-tos, they’d bemuch different than what he’d written then. We’re far beyond where we were asartists than when he was alive. I know people moan about “the good old days”and there are folks out there who feel the golden age of literature was in theTwenties, but they’re wrong. The best literature ever written is beingpublished today. In 1925 you could name perhaps 10-15 writers who were reallygood. Today, there are literally hundreds and hundreds of writers working whoare infinitely better at what they do that those folks were. Lit profs won’tadmit to that (or even know that), because it would erode their purpose inlife, but it’s true. The competition today is fiercer than it ever has been andthat’s because the competition is infinitely better.Myadvice is for writers to use their noodles and be skeptical. Questioneverything a teacher tells you. Me, included. That doesn’t mean to beargumentative and look for ways to trip ‘em up, but to seriously look ateverything put out there. If it makes sense to you and works, use it. If itdoesn’t, then don’t. But, don’t hold on to whatever you believe forever. It’llchange. Take it as fact that if you’re successful as a writer, you won’t bewriting the same way in ten years. Things will change. For a major one, post-modernismis dead and has been for a couple of decades. You won’t be told that in a litor writing class in most colleges however. They still think it’s the hautecuisine… It’s like that thing called “literary fiction.” That’s as over as areModel A Fords and has been for some time.Sorryto be going on so long about this(!), but I think it’s important. Let me givey’all an example from the world of screenwriters that’s a clear parallel toprose writers.Ihave a close friend—Lisa Lieberman Doctor—who was one of the top executives inHollywood. When she was married to her former husband, Hal Lieberman, he wasthe president of Universal Studios and she ran their prodco. After that, shestarted up Robin Williams prodco, Blue Wolf Productions, for him. She signed Mrs. Doubtfire, among dozens of othermovies for them and ran their production. She also ran the prodco at WarnerBros. and other major studios. She switched gears for awhile and was nominatedfor a Daytime Emmy for a soap series she wrote for. The L.A. Times named her one of the “10 Most Influential WomenExecutives in Hollywood.” I’m just trying to establish Lisa’s bona fides herefor what I’m about to relate. She’s the real deal. She was the person who couldand did get movies made.Webecame friends years ago when she read my first writer’s how-to, Finding Your Voice, and emailed me a fanletter and we soon became fast friends. Today, Lisa runs a writer’s group inher home in Malibu and sends me private clients from her group. Among othersI’ve coached on their novels (through her recommendation) are Karen (Witter)Lorre (Chuck Lorre’s wife, he of Two anda Half Men, Dharma & Gregg, Roseanne fame as the creator/producer), BobRotstein (top Hollywood lawyer, who recently won a $300 million landmarklawsuit case over Dodgeball), and anumber of Hollywood movers and shakers who all want to write a novel. Studioheads, top entertainment lawyers, producers and directors, and more than oneA-list movie star. I’ve worked with more than half a dozen of some of thebiggest names in Hollywood, thanks to Lisa. We talk almost every week and she’stold me a lot of inside things about how Hollywood actually works.Forinstance, a couple of years ago I was the co-presenter at the annual Writer’sInstitute, one of the top writer’s conventions, held annually at the Universityof Wisconsin. My co-presenter was a woman whom I won’t name, but who has a bunchof books out on screenwriting, whose name you’d probably recognize if Irevealed it. I’d read her books but didn’t think much of them, but she doessell a lot of them. Anyway, I called Lisa to ask her what she thought of thewoman. She just laughed and said, she (the woman) was a joke in Hollywood. Thatshe tried to pitch everybody for her own material and nobody took herseriously. That even though she claimed to have sold scripts, she reallyhadn’t. What she’d done was she got a couple of rewrite jobs from folks likeBuck Henry and some other oldtimers who can’t sell these days, and even thoughthey hadn’t used her rewrites, she could technically claim them as her work.Basically, Lisa said she was a lune, and mostly a joke in Hollywood. She wentfurther and named a bunch of other people who write these books on movies andhold seminars and the whole bit and she said the real decision-makers inHollywood mostly laughed about them and shook their heads at all the folks theywere fleecing. She talked about one guy who writes these things where “thisplot point has to happen on page whatever” and “this plot point has to happenby page whatever,” and just started laughing. She said they could alwaysrecognize the scripts written by those who’d read these people’s books orattended their seminars, and they never sold, or if they did, they sold inspite of the writer following this screwed-up advice. In fact, she said thatwhole business about having various plot points happen on whatever pages was acomplete myth. Lisa said all that ever sold a script was a good story. Nobodylooked at where plot points happened or ever would. She said that’s just becomea cottage industry that Hollywood insiders just laughed at and wondered who therubes were who supported it.Now,Lisa told me all this stuff in confidence. She’d never knowingly hurt anyone’sfeelings—I’m a bit different…Shetold me another interesting story that illustrates some teachers. She was theexpert witness for the winning side in Bob Rotstein’s 20th Century’scase over Dodgeball. She told me theexpert witness for the other (losing) side was the chairman of the filmdepartment at NYU. She’d call me every week and talk to me about the trial asit was going on. She was shocked, she said, by how ignorant this guy was of thefilm business. As the trial went on, she said every single time he took thewitness chair he revealed how abysmal his knowledge of how Hollywood operatedwas. She said she felt sorry for the students who were going to schoolthere—paying $45.000 a year to learn from a guy and his profs who didn’t have aclue how the business worked. Before the trial, she’d assumed he wasknowledgeable but the trial revealed him to be utterly ignorant about hissubject. And, this was NYU—supposedlya good film school! If this was the state of ignorance at a major film school,she wondered what kids at lesser schools were learning. Well, she already knew.Not much and barely anything real. Some are even still teaching people like SydFields and those dinosaurs.Wetalked over time about some of the guys who hold seminars. There’s one who hasone they must have based the movie Burt Reynolds was in on where his loveinterest took him and his competitor to this guru thing where you couldn’tleave to go to the bathroom or the guru felt hugely insulted. This dude has srocrowds wherever he holds his events and Lisa said they were hysterical. That noone in Hollywood gave him any credence whatsoever, but that the folks in Ames,Iowa and other points in the “Great Flyover” flock to his events and depart“saved.”Thepoint is, be careful where you get your info from. Sometimes, these things arecreated by folks who are mostly… good salespeople. Very convincing on the stageand they preach a gospel people want to hear. That YOU CAN MAKE IT! Providedyou pony up a couple months’ mortgage money and don’t get up to go to the bathroomduring the Grand Poohbahs’ message…Isthis information readily available? Nope. In fact, even those who know some ofthe realities in the writing game aren’t going to tell you. A few years ago, Iwouldn’t have either, but I’m at the age where I’m really getting tired ofseeing honest and well-meaning people who just want to master a craft beingconstantly taken advantage of. There are a lot of charlatans out there…Kindof like MFA programs… I’ve got one and talk about throwing money away and wastingtime… Another day, another subject…Again,sorry to go on at such length. Just beware of anyone promising a formula forwriting a quality story. There isn’t any. It’s really simple. The fivestatements on our outlines are what all stories are about. There are three actsto any publishable story. The two main elements in story-building are scenesand sequels. Anything crucial in a novel has to be expressed in a scene. Everythingderives from that and is subservient to that.Thething is, many beginners think there are “secrets” to learning to write well.There aren’t. All the “secrets” are in plain sight. Pick up any good book andat the places that affect you emotionally, just look at what the author did.Then, copy the technique. Techniques aren’t copyrighted. The “secrets” areright in front of us.Now. To your work, Todd! (Finally…) Theabove was for everyone.(Remember (everyone) to always send youroutline in each time with the work.)Todd, this came in with space breaks between eachparagraph. Went ahead and fixed it.ii.Hilaríon awoke, heavy-eyed and sore, unsure where he was or how he’dgotten there.Groaning, he lifted his swimming head. His head was swimming? Hope he had those little floaties on it… J Just need to rephrase thisso it doesn’t look like a disembodied head doing the backstroke… Slowly it all came back, shred by terrifying shred: the shred—valley (Colons are considered archaicpunctuation in contemporary fiction. As are semicolons, to a lesser degree.Still used in nonfiction, but in fiction these days we employ em dashesinstead. It’s less formal and doesn’t reveal the author as much as do colons.) valley,the voices, the collapse and the fall. Thisis all telling/summary/expositon… backstory. Doesn’t belong at the beginning ofa story. He was at the bottom of a cavern, beneath the most forbidden placehis people knew. He had gone farther than anyone had ever dreamed, and deeperinto peril than anyone had ever dared. He was a pioneer, a heretic, and areckless fool, all at once. Quite therap sheet! Problem is, he’s telling us all this stuff and thereader won’t care or become emotionally involved in the least. He rolled his neck backwards, looking overhead. High above, the firststreaks of dawn glimmered through fissures in the ceiling. The night was gone,lost, and now he was trapped—no spoils, no Towns, and no way out. He struggledto his feet, trembling, looking back at the ceiling. How he’d survived the fallhe could only guess. No one would believe what had happened to him.  But…since we weren’t there when he fell, it has no impact on us.And no one would ever find him. He dragged his feet across the mossy stone. An icy gust filled his eyesand a sound, like a dying beast, rose from the stillness. There was somethingbeside him.Hilaríon jerked away, drawing his machete. “Who’s there?”          It didn’t answer.“Get back!”It didn’t move.Hilaríon thrust his blade into the darkness, striking something in ashower of sparks. He pulled away, ready to strike again. Why would he try to kill something sight unseen, and that he doesn’tknow if it means him harm or not? This kind of shows him to be a bit skittish,doesn’t it? “Who are you?”It said nothing, only moaning, then gurgling, like a drowning animal. Hilaríonedged closer, prodding it with his blade. Whatever it was, it was made ofstone—but it breathed. Hilaríon pressed his palms against the stone, quivering,ready to pull away. His eyes widened. In (Watch two spaces betweensentences.) the spreading light, it was coming into view.He stumbled to the ground in terror. Peering from the gloom was a man’sface. Through the sinkhole, the rosy flush of morning spilled across thecavern. Looming above him was a pillar, engraved with faces, heaving their icybreath against his trembling flesh. Hilaríon rose, shuddering in the sunlight,terrified and transfixed all at once. He was surrounded by faces.One by one, they burst from the darkness: faces of men and woman; facesof elders, infants, large and small; faces of beauty and faces of malice—alltheir mouths gaping wide, all wrenched in the throes of ecstasy and song. Thelight revealed others: hundreds—no, thousands—carved in every inch of cavernstone, up and down a cavalcade of sculpted pillars; a churning flood of faces,no two alike.In the valley above, the wind began to gust, rustling the grasses as itpassed. And, he knows this… how? He’s inthis cave-dealie and he can hear the grass above rustling? From thepillars, ceiling and walls—from the very stone of the cavern itself—the chorusrose again, resounding through the underworld: the voices of the Wailing Watersin harmony with the morning breeze, no longer ghostly but joyous, no longerterrible but beautiful. Hilaríon retched in cathartic laughter. The voices werenothing more than wind across the open tops of hollow pillars. So… they’re no big deal. Just the wind.Which he can miraculously hear from inside a cave? Sounds like it must havebeen a hurricane… (Take care that descriptions are logical.) He sheathed his machete and hunched at the knees, leaning against thepillar and wiping the sweat from his brow until his sleeves were soaked and histrembling legs had settled still.    Hilaríon raised his head as slowly, his eyes adjusted to the light. Thefaces were in full bloom, limned by the morning sun, their every crack,blemish, and imperfection (When awriter uses more than one adjective, usually their intent is to make the imagemore powerful. Alas, the opposite occurs. With each additional adjective, thepower is halved. More than one just diffuses the effect.) clear in thelight. He blinked, looking closer. Some of the faces were mounted to bodies,and those bodies to arms, and every arm, hand, and finger pointed the same way.His eyes traced their lines across the cavern to an alcove, pulsing with agolden glow. Excellent description here,with the exception noted. Simple, clear language. He pushed from the stone and stumbled forward, snaking between thepillars towards the light, passing beneath an archway into the alcove. Thetarnished gilding of its walls scattered sunlight, illuminating the alcove likea sacristy. In the center stood a plinth, carved from reddish stone. And here.Hilaríon looked up. Past roots and tangled grasses, at the mouth of astone shaft, the morning sky shone cobalt blue.          The way out. And, so… if he’d just lifted his head aminute or so before you couldn’t have had him think--And no one would ever find him—as was written earlier.          Hilaríon heaved a lustysigh.  He would escape—he would live—afterall. And, his salvation came after aterrible struggle where he had to learn… to look up… The plinth was justtall enough to boost him into the shaft. He grabbed it with both hands andpulled his foot over top—          “What’s this?”          He backed away,struggling to keep his footing, and looked closer. The platform atop the plinthwas hollowed out, and wedged inside was a marble box. Inscribed on the box lidwas an unknown glyph. You have a bunchof line spaces following this and they’re not marked. There’s also no reasonfor space breaks here. Space breaks are only used when there’s a significantshift in time, place or pov change. And, they are always marked.          Hilaríon peered up theshaft to the sky, growing bluer by the moment, filled with drifting clouds. Theoutside world was waiting—Grijalva and Garcíd were waiting, or they’d moved on,thinking him dead or gone deserter. Mightwant to reconsider these names, Todd. They’re similar and could easily lead thereader into confusing them. Time was his enemy—with each passing hourGrijalva’s rage and Garcíd’s jealousy would only grow, the less likely they’dtake him back at all. Alone in a hostile wilderness, without protectors orplan, he’d be short work for rival hilldevils. Again, more setup/backstory. You’re asking the reader to take his wordthat there’s some kind of danger out there. The intelligent reader is a bornskeptic—he/she doesn’t take the writer’s word for anything. We need to see thedanger before we believe there is any. This is all telling and just doesn’twork.          But the box—what wasinside? He had to know.(Implied.)Hilaríon slipped his hands into the hollow and clasped the box, sleekand fluid, (Again, you’re pairingadjectives to force a stronger image and the opposite effect takes place. Also,how is ice “fluid?” like ice.  He(Watch these two spaces between spaces.)squeezed it between his hands, raising it to the platform. His headthrobbed, still roiling from the rock, the fruitless chase, and the midnightfall. None of which we’ve seen. Herubbed his temples, licked his lips, and lifted the lid.Hilaríon gasped, dumbfounded. Inside the box was a golden medallion.He grasped at the plinth, delirious, not sure whether he’d strayed intoa dream. He knit his fingers around the medallion and held it to the light,poring over its fine details—its crevices and cavities and its thousand tinymysteries, all the while sighing, holding his breath, and then sighing again,as if intoning some ancient rite with sacred relics. He’s really going gaga over this—so far, it looks as if he’s justfound a… golden medallion. Hardly worth “gasping” over or a “delirious, notsure he’d strayed into a dream” kind of a gold medallion. Not from what we’reseeing. This is over-the-top, elevated, melodramatic language and description,as is much of this. This is the sure sign of a writer trying to force emotionon the reader via language. That never works. Emotion is only created in thereader when he/she lives through a scene in which something happens that earnsthe emotion.Alongits edges in golden relief were two beasts, looking like fishes but larger, their every line,groove, and scale wrought with such precision they seemed to wriggle in hishands, gulping for air. Beside them, in smaller reliefs, were humans, swimmingalongside the beasts. Poised between the beasts’ snouts was an ellipse, showinga star beside the sun, and between their flukes was another ellipse, showing astar and the crescent moon. Just above each fluke was a hole, bored into theedging, and across the medallion was writing, broken in the center by acircular hollow, illegible. Set in the hollow was the same unknown glyph as onthe box lid.He flipped the medallion over. On the opposite side was a snarl ofcoils, like a tangled knot, dotted with ovals marked with glyphs, only two ofwhich he recognized: a six-pointed star, and—once again—the unknown glyph fromthe other side. Hilaríon scratched his head, crinkling his nose. He’d neverseen anything to compare with its beauty, nor anything close to its worth. It was priceless. And he knowsthis, how? There’s an awful lot of stuff on this medallion. It looks like itneeds to be four-five feet in circumference to have all this on it, especiallysince it’s so clear at a glance to him, up to and including the individualscales on the fish. I think most people assume something of medallion-size tobe a bit smaller and probably not able to include all that he’s seeing here.The sun reared its fiery head over the shaft, bathing the alcove inlight. Something caught Hilaríon’s eye, hewn in the alcove wall. He lowered themedallion, cradling it in his hands, and sidled around the plinth. Carved inthe corroded metal, cracked and faded by the rigors of time, was an inscription.He drew closer, straining his eyes, and read aloud. Todd, you’ve got an extra line space following this and then you’vegot the poem single-spaced. It needs to be double-spaced. The editor willsingle space it for the print version, but the writer double-spaces it. I’ll goahead and fix it. If you want to separate it out from the other text, use aspace break and be sure to mark it. Also, just wondering why he would read itout loud? If he reads it out loud, it requires quote marks around it, and youwouldn’t center it like you have but present it as dialog.

No one describes themselves thisway. This is from an omniscient stance and omniscient povs are very archaic andalmost impossible to get published today. dissolved in gall. Benthic depths? Capriciousfield? Twisting heirloom? It was meaningless. I agree…The wind drifted past in the valley above, and again the voices ofthe Wailing Waters sang, before falling deathly still. Hilaríon looked at the gaping faces in the stone. Whathad once seemed grand and moving now seemed foolish—a tragic caricature of hisrace. What had looked like wayward souls shoutingmonumental tidings from the depths of time was but a riddle. Silence, as ever, reignedsupreme. Totally melodramatic, purpleprose.Hethought of the silence that had rung down the ages—silence that should havebeen the voices of ancestors, the songs of his people’s roots, the words ofwisdom preached into the great collective ear of his kin, pointing the way toprosperity. Instead, that silence had bred indolence, and forgetfulness. He wasa boy, in a cave, with a newfound prize.And that prize belonged to him. So… how is this a problem?Hestroked the medallion in his fingers, delighting at his fortune.  The (Watch twospaces between sentences.) Devils Three, in a year, couldn’t collect evenhalf its worth. It would fetch a king’s ransom in the Towns—no, theCities. Hilaríon’s eyes rolled backward in his skull and his skin turnedeager gooseflesh, as the word and its every splendor wafted through his mind. He’s showing swooning signs just bythinking of a name? Wow! And, what is “eager gooseflesh?” This is purple prose,magnified to the nth degree. Lord Bulwer-Lytton is turning green in his gravewith envy, wishing he’d said this.LaHabana.Hesaid it aloud, sampling its nectar, letting it drip from his lips and from hisimagination, pooling thick in the basin of his cravings.I’m sorry, Todd, but I’m throwing up inmy mouth. Just a little… Stop it, please… “La Habana,” he whispered,running the medallion along his neck. “Better days.”Hilaríon closed his hand around the medallion, hiding it beneath hiscloak. Grijalva and Garcíd never needed to know. Why go back to them at all? They’donly take the medallion from him, penance for a botched ambush, or make himshare it, third among equals as they held him, or something altogether worse. Grijalvaalready wanted him dead—that was no secret. Garcíd kept Grijalva at bay, buteven Garcíd had his price. What was there for him but toil, and danger, and sleeplessnights with one eye open? Again, morebackstory/setup.  Theoutside world was vast, and bright, and warm, beckoning him with outstretchedarms. Deep inside, he’d always known it to be true. Those were his tomorrows,something the life of a hilldevil could never promise or deliver. That waswhere he had to be—out of the hills and out of the west, charging into the swirling eddy of a life unlived. Melodramatic,purple prose. Is he channeling Thoreau? Or, more accurately, Thoreau asrewritten by Bulwer-Lytton?There were better days ahead.Hilaríon buried the medallion in his pocket and climbed back onto theplinth. Groping at the stones he winched himself into the shaft and spread hislegs, wedging himself inside. He grunted, stretching tall. Ahead, the shafttapered to a winding crevice. The air grew warmer, drenched with the welcomingsmells of the marsh—the vibrant, colorful earth calling him forth. He heavedhimself upwards, pushing and pulling against the crevice walls, stumbling,rising, and stumbling again, flanked by dirt and tumbling pebbles, untilexhausted, legs and arms cut to ribbons, he clambered into daylight.The sun hung above the east, the crown jewel in a glorious tiara ofhaystack hills. He pulled the medallion from his pocket, admiring it in thesunlight, even more brilliant than it had seemed beneath the earth. He grinned,feeling the warmth of the morning sun and the hot promise of La Habana againsthis face, cooled only by the kiss of a wandering breeze.And then they returned, one final time: the voices of the WailingWaters, neither frightful nor proud but wretched—vaguely sad, as if mourningsome great loss. But what were they but a chorus of the past, a threnody for adoomed people and a lost world? His better days spread wide before him. Heburied the medallion in his pocket and tore off towards the Eastbound Road,parting the tall grasses as he ran.“Boy!”Grijalva and Garcíd stood in the roadway.Todd, I’mafraid there’s no story problem or even the hint of one on the page as of yetand we’re eight pages into the narrative. At this point, all we’ve seen is he’sfound this medallion… and that’s it. No problem whatsoever. Remember thedefinition: The inciting incident is something that happens to the protagonistthat creates and/or reveals the story problem. Finding this medallion may ultimately prove to be aproblem, but at this point it isn’t. Look carefully at the definition,especially the words in italics. It has to be revealed to him at the time of the inciting incidentthat he has a problem. If he has one or if it will prove that the medallioncreates one, then the moment he realizes he has a problem occasioned bywhatever happens then is the inciting incident. The problem absolutely must beclear to him at that moment and remain clear the rest of the novel. None ofthat is happening here. And, it has to be a problem, not an opportunity.Not onlythat, but there’s no conflict happening here whatsoever. We get a bunch ofsetup/backstory but unfortunately, that’s all telling/exposition and doesn’timpact in the least on the reader.This isthe single biggest error most writers make in their beginnings. Starting withbackstory/setup. Just not done any more with contemporary fiction. Readerstoday expect a story to begin with a compelling problem and they expect a scenethat delivers that problem.The otherproblem is that you’re trying to create emotion in the reader with flowery,elevated language. This is just chockfull of purple prose. You simply cannotforce emotion on the reader this way. The only thing that elicits emotion fromthe reader is by the reader living through a scene right along with theprotagonist.You’remaking a basic mistake here. You’re doing the same thing students do in highschool when they first try to write poetry. Here’s what happens. The tyro poetfeels some kind of great emotion—at that age, usually because Sally or Samthrew him over for someone else who had a newer Playstation. They feel all this“emotion” and when they set out to write a poem, they describe the emotion theyfeel. But, they neglect to deliver the scene or act that created that emotion.They bring to the task all the elevated language they’re capable of—lots ofstuff expressed alliteratively about tears (usually a lone tear coursing downthe cheek), and using every adjective in the book. But, it’s not poetry and itdoesn’t work. It’s telling the reader the writer feels all this deep emotion and tries to forcethe emotion they feel on the reader via language. And, that can never work.What will work—and the ones who learn this go on to have their poetrypublished—is to create a poem where they take the reader through the scenewhere the girl/guy broke up with them. Then, they don’t need to have “a lonetear coursing down their cheek.” If they simply write that breakup scene withskill, the reader will have their own tear streaking down their cheek, althoughhopefully the tears will come in pairs and not as a solo act. Nothing tooemotional about a blocked-up tear duct…Anyway,this is the primary problem here. You’re trying to use language in a way thatdoesn’t work. What I’d suggest is to rent a dump truck, load all this purpleprose and elevated language into it, drive out to the dump… and dump it.Then,write a scene where something happens. A scene with conflict. Which meanspeople interacting. A scene that creates an inciting incident which createsand/or reveals a compelling problem. A clear problem—both to the protagonistand also to the reader.Let’s saythat this medallion does lead to a story problem that will occupy him the restof the story. Let’s say it begins when the “G” boys find out he’s got it. Andthey try to take it away from him and if that happens, maybe then he’s got aproblem. Maybe one of them reveals that this is the “Magic Medallion ofMatasucki” and that whoever possesses it has the key to Something Important. Atthat point, provided he wants to keep it, he has a surface problem. And, ifthat’s the case, that’s the inciting incident and where the story needs tobegin. Not when he finds it if all that happens is that he finds it and it’s a reallycool piece of jewelry. That’s not a problem in the least.If how hefound it is somehow important (as it’s written now, it isn’t), then bring thatin later. But, the first thing the reader should encounter is a scene in whichthe story problem is created and/or revealed. Not even ten minutes before thathappens. Only at the time it happens. Anything that happens before the incitingincident is backstory and contemporary (and publishable) fiction simply can’tbegin with backstory. Make sense?I get thefeeling, Todd, that you’ve worked on this story for a long time and have a lotof material. That means you’re heavily invested into it and are probablyproprietary about it. That’s understandable and very human! But, if it’s notworking then it doesn’t matter how many months or years the writer has spent onit, nor how many hundreds of pages have been written. It won’t matter if thewriter has 500 words or 500 pages if it doesn’t work. If it can be salvaged orpart of it salvaged, that’s great, but if it can’t be, then the sooner it’s putaside and work begins on something that can work, the better. Is that hard todo? Well, sure! And, for some it may be impossible. Only that writer knows. Thething is, even in the worst case scenario—let’s say none of it issalvageable—that’s not a bad thing. It just means that writer is even closer tosuccess. He or she has just learned a huge and valuable lesson—what won’t work.Which makes the writer a giant step closer to publication.I don’thave a clue if the rest of what you have with this novel can work. Only you candecide that. But, if the feedback you’ve gotten or may get from the gatekeeperssays it isn’t publishable, then I’d pay attention to what they’re saying. All Iknow is that the work here isn’t and really isn’t even close. That’s a toughthing to hear, I know. And, it’s just one person’s opinion. I do think that’sthe same opinion you’ll get from just about any agent or editor, at least fromthis sample. There are two ways you can go.The goodnews is that you do have considerable writing talent. That’s evident from thisparagraph (with a few small edits). Look at the writing here:Hilaríon raised his head asslowly, his eyes adjusted to the light. The faces were in full bloom, limned bythe morning sun, their every imperfectionclear in the light. He blinked, looking closer. Some of the faces weremounted to bodies, and those bodies to arms, and every finger pointed the sameway. His eyes traced their lines across the cavern to an alcove, pulsing with agolden glow.Someonewho can write this paragraph can flat-out write. If a writer can write a goodsentence, he can write two. It means he can also write 2,000 good sentences.Your talent’s not the problem—it’s how you’re using it. This is just a wake-upcall and I hope you see it as such.Hope thishelps!Blueskies,LesAnd that’s ourearly exchanges in class. Todd sent me a signed copy of his book along withthis series of exchanges we had in discussing it in progress. When I asked himif I could post this as a blogpost, this is what he said:Les,Attached is what I believe you're looking for. I still get chillsreading it, although they're good chills now. I would be honored to be featuredin your blog, and would be happy to participate in it any way you might want.Hope this is ofsome help to other writers with similar writing problems. Also, it shows howour online class works. We rarely have an opening but we can take on limitlessauditors and if you opt for that, this is the kind of exchanges you’d be privyto. Auditing is a good deal I believe, for only $50 for each 10-week session.Blue skies,Les"},

It’s a remarkablepiece of work. It just goes to prove that anyone with talent (many) and perseverance(rare) and the ability to take constructive criticism (very rare!) can create apublishable book.If you saw the firstdraft of what Kristen sent me a couple of years ago and compared it to what sheended up with, you’d easily see the veracity of that last sentence.Here’smy blurb:Blurbfor Kristen Lamb’s novel, THE DEVIL’S DANCEIpicked up Kristen Lamb’s debut novel, THE DEVIL’S DANCE, fully expecting to bereading what I anticipated as a decent first effort at fiction—and wasinstantly dissuaded of that notion—finding instead totally mesmerized by a bookof the quality normally reserved for those best-selling, rave review-garnering,masters of thriller novels. I was totally gobsmacked. Lamb has crafted a workof immense worth. It’s truly remarkable in its maturity, level of writing, andmost important, level of entertainment. We often see reviews where they trotout that hoariest of clichés—“It was so good I couldn’t put it down,” except inthis case that’s not even close to an exaggeration, but the honest damnedtruth. Be assured this is no “beginner’s first effort.” This is leagues abovethat. Already, I’ve placed it on the shelf of “Best Books of the Year That I’veRead.” It most certainly is. I won’t give you a synopsis—that’s already donefor you on the Amazonpage, but if my opinion means anything to you, I urge you to run right out andbuy this novel. Lamb is just one smart cookie who doesn’t seem to fail at anyenterprise she sets her hand to.

The medallion around the woman’s throatis there for Hilaríon’s taking, but the soldier-turned-highwayman cannot bringhimself to commit murder. He chases the mysterious woman, Ypriána, into thewilds. He’ll seize his plunder, then while away the rest of his life in somefar-flung corner of the globe. But when she tempts him with a better choice,something inside of him leaps at the chance.Ypriánais a savior on a mission—or so she believes. Her people, the M’Brae, have longlived in darkness, but an ancient promise of priceless treasure gives them aglimmer of hope. Only through her can they overcome the Vexing Heirloom, thedeadly gauntlet preceding the treasure, yet she needs Hilaríon’s help. Thethief hears only one word: treasure.Asarmies clash all around them, Hilaríon and Ypriána marshal her people along theperilous quest, which will bring them face-to-face with savage enemies,mind-bending riddles, and treachery even within their own ranks. Seeing himselfthrough Ypriána’s eyes, Hilaríon staggers ever closer unto redemption, yet hefinds the mounting questions more trying still. Is finding treasure worth suchpain? Could the treasure be more than just a prize?Andin their darkest hour, as the line between friend and foe vanishes, Hilaríonmust forsake what he most desires and find the hero within.Praise for TheVexing Heirloom\"What makes TheVexing Heirloom such aremarkable debut—and T.G.

Lesley and I worked closelytogether on all of her novels, including her latest one which is scheduled tobe released on June 14.(Please click on Lesley's photo for the link to take you to her Author's Page and books on Amazon.)I had just gotten an email fromher a few days ago, telling me she was sending me a copy of The Serial Killer’s Daughter and hadincluded me in the acknowledgements as she always did, when I was blindsidedfrom an email from Paul Brazill, our mutual friend, letting me know that herdaughter Estelle had just posted the sad news on Lesley’s Facebook page. Then,before I could even read it, I got another email from another mutual friend,Vince Zandri, who gave me the same news. All of us are in deep shock.I met Lesley about four years agowhen she contacted me to see if I would be willing to work with her on a novelshe was writing. As soon as I read the first pages, I was in. Just brilliantstory-telling. She eventually joined our online novel-writing class, buteventually dropped out as she wanted to just work one-on-one. Over the years,we not only worked closely as colleagues, but became fast friends. An ex-patBrit, she was living in Spain. Prior to our meeting, she had her ex-husband hadedited several of Europe’s top magazines from London, but had decided to moveto Spain and work on her fiction. The world of letters has lost amagnificent writer. Those who knew her have lost a wonderful friend. She willbe sorely missed.Here is information about Lesleyfrom her Amazon Author’s page:Lesley Welshwas born in Strawberry Field children’s home and raised on a notoriousLiverpool council estate. Later she moved to London, where she studied Englishand drama and worked as a freelance writer specialising in alternativelifestyles. Her articles appeared in Cosmopolitan, Marie Clare, Red, Bite, Forum,Time Out and many others before she established Moondance Media, a magazinepublishing company. Her dark and compelling short story Mrs Webster’s Obsessionwas turned into a film. She now lives and works in Spain. Her first crime novel 'Truth Lies Buried' was published byThomas & Mercer in June 2016 and has been nominated for the CWA GoldenDagger Award as the best crime novel of 2016.

You can read the original German version at: http://www.stuttgarter-zeitung.de/inhalt.les-edgerton-der-vergewaltiger-wahre-kaelte.1f7392cd-4cd9-49e4-bd3f-438b5d9c3e55.htmlTranslation:“Stuttgart- Frank Nowatzkis Pulp Master is well known as a publishing house fordisturbing ones. Seamus Smyth's \"Revenge of Revenge\" and GeraldKersh's \"The Dead Look\" are books that are hard to bear in theirartistic and historical truth. Les Edgerton, whose novel \"DerVergewaltiger\" (\"Der Verwaltiger\"), has also looked quite a bitsince its appearance - but there is no historical event in the background butonly the guilt of an individual (the one with the atonement is in this casesuch a thing ). The author has not thought of a hero, but an enemy of man who,intelligently and formally educated, faces his surroundings only with hatredand contempt. This Truman Ferris Pinter goes his way, he is financiallyindependent and does not have to work as a teacher, anyway he finds studentsdisgusting.Onenight, Pinter watches three men and a woman while sex on the way home in theforest. During the day, the girl dives with him while he is fishing and startsto mock him. There is a quarrel, Pinter rests and rapes his victim. Afterwards,he says in court, he says in the prison, he tells the reader that the girl hasstumbled, headed against a stone, and drowned in the river.Pinteris sentenced to death for murder, in prison, he examines the past, analyzes hispresence, paints his future, and mentions, as by chance, authors such as AlbertCamus and Fyodor Dostoyevsky. As an \"unreliable narrator\", he leavesthe reader unclear as to what is to be said of all this. True to Truman FerrisPinter is just his cold - and the fate that is heading for it. Or in the endnot?

{"title": "TWO OPENINGS IN OUR ONLINE NOVEL-WRITING CLASS AVAILABLE", "date": "Friday, April 14, 2017", "text": "Hifolks,*Update: Folks, the openings have been filled so alas I can't take any more for this session. If interested, however, we can add as many auditors as there are applicants. If interested in auditing, please contact me. You see everything we do in class and although you don't participate, what you'll observe are usually the same mistakes almost all writers make and I've gotten nothing but positive feedback from those who've audited in the past. Typical is one auditor who told me that he'd learned more about writing in one ten-week session of watching us at work than he'd learned in the whole of his MFA experience. We teach with the sole goal of publication.*Well,we’re just finishing up our final week on the current session of my onlinenovel-writing class, “Les Edgerton’s Bootcamp for Writers,” and find ourselveswith the rarity of a couple of openings. Our next session will begin on April30 and consists of a ten-week session, with the probability of taking a weekoff sometime during the term to recharge batteries.Thisis a call for new class members. Not sure how many openings we’ll have as weoffer vacancies first to our auditors.Thebasics are the course costs $400 and it’s limited to ten people. The $400 isnonrefundable, as if a person quits during the session it would be impossibleto fill that vacancy. As this is my primary source of income, it would bedetrimental for myself and my family. It’s very rare that anyone opts out oncebegun, however. In over five years, there have only been two.We’vehad a remarkable history of success. Nearly everyone over the past six yearswho has become a part of our class has gone on to being legitimately publishedand/or secured a good literary agent. In fact, that is our only goal—to becomelegitimately published.A couple of our current and former class members meet up in Scottsdale, AZ.I try to warn people who arethinking of joining us, how tough the class is, but I know from past experiencethat even so forewarned, at least some are going to be in for a shock when theysee that we really don’t hold hands, pat people on the back for minimumefforts, or overlook writing that doesn’t work. I’m not cruel (at least I don’tthink so) nor are any of the oldtimers in class, but most new folks haven’tbeen exposed to a class like ours. The truth is, most writers who haven’t had aclass like ours has been praised in other classes or most likely, has been inclasses that use the “sandwich” method of teaching. You know—that deal wherethe teach applies a bit of praise, then a bit of criticism, and then a bit ofpraise. Well, that ain’t our shtick. Not even close. The comments we allprovide on everyone’s work fit one definition only. They’re honest.This isn’t to be mean or to act likewe’re the only folks around who know what good writing is. Except… we do. I’mnot aware of any other class out there with the kind of track record oursenjoys. Virtually every writer who stays the course with us ends up with a topagent and/or a book deal. That doesn’t happen in a single ten-week session.About the earliest anyone has earned an agent or book deal in our class hasbeen about a year. And, that’s reasonable.The thing is, our writers don’texpect things to be easy.From a student several years ago:Hi ________. Since Les opened thefloor for comments from the \"class veterans\" I'm chipping in with mytwo cents. I have a file cabinet filled with stuff I sent Les and then neededasbestos gloves to take the paper off the printer. When I started this journey,I'd never taken an English class past high school. (I was pre-med in college) Ifigured I love to read, so how hard can it be? Okay, quit laughing at me.Clearly, when I wrote my first version of my first novel, I had no idea aboutstory structure, POV, any of that. I figured I'm pretty articulate andtherefore I can write?Les quickly set me straight. All ofthis is to point out that we've all been on the receiving end of Les' brutalhonesty. I will find some of the comments he made on my work and post them butphrases like \"throwing up in my mouth now\" and \"bury this sodeep in the yard no one ever finds it\" are seared into my brain and Idon't have to look to find those!!! The point is, I took other classes before Imet Les and the teachers were kind and gentle and never told me I sucked. If itweren't for Les, I'd still be churning out awful drivel that makes people wantto throw up instead of trying not to throw up while I wait to see if my agentis able to sell my book. I would never have gotten an agent without Les. Sohang in there. Listen to everything he says and if it doesn't make sense, askaway.The novel that I am currently tryingto sell has been a work in progress since 2009. The first time Les saw it hesent it back and told me to re-write the WHOLE thing!!! My character was awimp. She sat back and let things happen to her. I argued a little, rewrote alittle and then moved on to another book. After a year, I went back and rereadit and saw the truth. It was awful. So I took a deep breath and started over.Page one. First sentence. Re-wrote the entire thing. It took a full year andthen I revised it again. It's definitely a process. But once you get theInciting incident and the outline steps down pat, it's a whole lot easier.Trust me!!! And you'll never graduate completely. A few months ago, Les and I wenthead-to-head on one single passage. I was trying to be lazy and take the easyway out. He called me on it and I resubmitted three or four weeks in a row,revisions on the same passage. I was sure my classmates were so sick of it theywere going to stick needles in their eyes rather than read it again! But in theend, the passage rocked!! So hang in there!!!! It'll get better. (Note: Thisnovel sold and the writer is currently working on her fifth novel.)From Les:Ifigured I’d let some of the class members give you their take on our class.They don’t hold back and they all have tough skins. They will all tell you thesame thing. It isn’t a class for sissies or for those who need their hands heldor lots of pats on the back. Becoming published is hard, hard work and isn’t anundertaking for sissies. To get there, our students know they have to put ontheir Big Boy and Big Girl pants and expect to work harder than they ever havein their lives—and to never, ever “settle” their standards of excellence.Classmembers come from all over the globe. We’ve had students from the UK, Ireland,Taiwan, Spain, all parts of the U.S., Canada, Australia, Luxembourg and manyother places. We work with writers in virtually every genre on the bookshelves.Theway class works is that the class is divided into two equal groups. We used tohave just one group, but it got to be too much for many students. In the past,everybody in the class was required to read everybody else’s work each week andprovide in-depth comments on everyone’s work. That meant they had to read nineother class members’ work and deliver intelligent commentary on each one. We’vesince evolved to a more manageable number where now each class member reads anddelivers comments on just four other classmates’ work. I provide comments oneverybody’s work and that’s why the class is limited to only ten. With tenwriters, I can give each person the quality of time and analysis each deserves.Eachweek begins on Sunday evening, when people can begin submitting their weeklypages from Sunday until Thursday. If it’s a new writer to the class, they areallowed to submit their first five pages of their novel, plus an outline whichconsists of five statements and a total of 15-20 words. Oldtimers in class callthis “inciting incident hell.” If the outline isn’t working and their beginningdoesn’t represent the inciting incident as provided in their outline, they arerequired to keep submitting each week until it does. Our feeling is if theyhaven’t thought through their novels sufficiently and provided a publishablenovel structure (evidenced by the outline), then they most likely don’t have anovel ready to be written and to simply plunge ahead will almost invariablylead to an unfinished novel. We don’t want that.Oncethey’ve been okayed for the beginning, from thereafter they can submit up toeight pages per week, along with the others in class.Timezones don’t matter. Everybody’s work, including everyone’s comments and my owncomments on each person’s work each week is posted on the class site and folkscan go to it any time of the day or night. Class members can begin sending backtheir comments on each others’ in their group from Sunday through the followingSunday, when it begins again. Although, in practicality, most members send intheir work each week on Wednesdays and Thursdays. It’s like being in an“on-ground” class in that everything said or done in class is seen byeverybody.Wedo have a chat function and people use it all the time, even though they’re indifferent time zones. One of the best things about this class is that we havelots of oldtimers who know from their own experience what works in a novel andwhat doesn’t and more importantly… whyit works or doesn’t work. It’s like having a group of seven or eight otherprofessionals helping you with your own novel. Probably at any given time inclass, there will be four or five who already have had a novel or severalpublished as a result of being in class, so it’s a really rarefied group. And,if you think that you couldn’t operate in a situation like this because you’rea beginner, that simply isn’t the case here at all. Nearly every single personin each class began just the way you did, as a rank beginner. And, theyremember and they have complete empathy for your situation, if you’re abeginning writer.It’snot a situation of simply saying, “This doesn’t work.” Myself and others inclass will surely say that, but we then let you know why it didn’t work andgive you solid suggestions on how to make it work. We collectively have anurturing nature and all of us want the newcomer to succeed just about as badlyas that writer wants to.Ifyou are still interested but still feel intimidated, I think if you simply lookat how the class works, you’ll quickly see how you’ll fit in comfortably. Sincewe’ve got one week left in class, for anyone who would like to see up close andpersonal how we work as a class, I’d be delighted to give you auditor statusfor our last week. Besides class members, we also have an auditor functionwhich works the same as it does in a “regular” college class. You’re admittedto class and can view every single thing we’re doing and the entire classsession is archived and easy to access. Normally, the cost of auditing theclass is $50, but for our last week, for those interested in simply getting alook at how we work, just email me at butchedgerton@comcast.netand let me know and I’ll have our class administrator, Holly, get you on boardasap.Iknow there are no doubt a lot of questions you may have.

{"title": "NOIR RULES", "date": "Sunday, April 2, 2017", "text": "Hi folks,Here's a piece I wrote awhile back you may find interesting...“REAL”CHARACTERS AS OPPOSED TO “HOLLYWOOD” CHARACTERS:NOIRRULES            As writers, each of us comes to ourchoice of this craft from different avenues and all of us have differentmotivations and agendas, based on any number of factors. Our life experience isperhaps the largest factor and that involves not only our childhood experiencesand relationships, but that English teacher in the fourth grade who encouragedus (or discouraged us—as psychology students learn, there are two possible waysto get the rat to run the maze—punishment or reward). Writing, to my mind, isone endeavor that doesn’t fall under the genetics/environment argument. I don’tbelieve in something called “the born writer.” If there were such a thing, whydidn’t Native Americans and other similar cultures ever produce a single writerbefore the white man took over the real estate? Story-tellers, yes, absolutely.But, no writers.            In fact, as a writer, accuracy isimportant to me, and it’s why I walked out of the movie Dances With Wolves. A third of the way through, a group of Indianboys have stolen Kevin Costner’s horse (obviously not aware of his iconicHollywood status) and are riding back to their camp. Subtitles inform us ofwhat they’re shouting. One boy yelled, “They’ll write songs about us!” (Italics mine.) Well, not one single NorthAmerican Indian tribe had the word “write” in their vocabulary; indeed, theconcept of writing didn’t exist prior to the white man becoming the landlord.From that moment forward, my disbelief became unsuspended, and I couldn’t buyany of the rest of the movie.            I looked up the original screenplayand the writer had it right. He’d written: “They’ll sing songs about us.” The writer got it right and the director oreditor or whoever changed it. Happens to us writer-types all the time.            The point I’m trying to make is thatwriting isn’t a result of genetics. It’s something created by environment. Theadditional point is that a writer should watch editors very carefully…            In my case, I’m just following thedictum, “Write what you know.”            Well… Les knows crime. I spent aconsiderable portion of my life doing crime stuff. Even spent two-plus years inprison, in one of Indiana’s then-two maximum security prisons, Pendleton, backin the sixties on a 2-5 for second-degree burglary. Did other things afterward,including dealing drugs, using drugs, working as an escort for wealthy women,was shot at and shot back, was involved in high-speed chases with the cops,lived with a call girl whose clientele involved people you’d recognize from People Magazine, was homeless, was involvedin stabbings, check-kiting, strong-armed robberies, and some other tricks andstratagems of the hustling trade.            I also have this weird desire towrite true accounts of the criminalmind in novels, something I’ve seen very little of. In fact, the only accuratedepiction of the criminal mind I’ve ever seen in a movie was the WoodyHarrelson character in Natural BornKillers. Although, it seems that movie turned off a lot of folks, whoprefer their criminals depicted in a more romantic and Hollywoodish fashion. InGlitter Town, most filmmakers would have Harrelson love cats or somethingequally insipid. And, yes, I know—it was a Hollywood movie, but an aberration. Veryfew novels, other than true noir, ever come close. One of the best novels thatgave us a true account of how people become criminals was Scott Smith’s A Simple Plan.            To be honest, most novels and filmsdon’t seem to come even remotely close to a realistic interpretation of thecriminal mind. That’s changing these days as noir makes a comeback.            What’s the reason most miss the truenature of the criminal mind? That’s easy. Most who write have never beencriminals. And, there’s no one to call them out on the inaccuracies as very fewcriminals read all that much for several reasons. One, limited access to books.When I was in Pendleton, our “library” consisted mostly of Zane Grey paperbacksand was housed in an oversized closet. Two, most inmates are poorly-educated.Again, when I was in Pendleton, the average educational level was third-grade.Therefore, the only people with critical acumen in the subject, don’t have muchof a voice or easy entre to the NY TimesBook Review.            The same situation exists in theMafia. Anyone who has known many Costa Nostra types personally knows that mostof these guys aren’t going to cure cancer, split the atom, or invent gravity.The greater numbers are mouth-breathing mesomophs, with the I.Q. power ofcandles and the achieved educational level of gnats.            When Mario Puzo wrote The Godfather, he admitted he’d never meta mafiosa. He confessed he’d made just about all the stuff in the book up. Hehad to. He was living in Connecticut, surrounded by life insurance executivesand stock brokers and typing on a door suspended on two sawhorses in hisspacious, well-appointed garage. (He said in an interview that if he’d known itwas going to be a big hit, he’d have “written it better,”) The “sleeping withthe fishes,” the “horsehead” stuff, the “hitting the mattresses” stuff, allcame out of his imagination. What happened was the guys in the Mob liked hisdepiction of them—even though it was all b.s.—as it greatly romanticized themand made them look… human?—even as coolhumans?—that they adopted the persona. They adopted the language in the novel(well, most didn’t read well enough to read the novel—most just saw the movie)and life imitated art. Now, until another movie comes out, most mafia guys aregoing to be cracking wise until they day they “sleep with the fishes” with thebon mots they observed Al Pacino uttering. It’ll have to be a different movie,though, as everything that followed TheGodfather seems to have used the same casting director.            Same thing happens with mostcriminals when they read a thriller. They adopt the role they see on the pageor up on the screen. Most criminals look like your neighbor the accountant inthe split-level down the block, but thanks to movies and thrillers, the averagecitizen is certain that they look either like Steve Buscemi or Samuel Jackson,and that the average warden looks like Robert Redford. Not my experience…            Let’s look at three of the mostcommon inaccuracies:1. Inmates in prison hate childmolesters.            Mostly hooey. It seems to becommon wisdom these days that people on the bricks (”straights”) believe thatinmates in prison hate child molesters and can’t wait to kill them. I disagree…to a point. Back in my time in prison (mid-sixties in a state joint, which isvastly different than a federal prison), nobody much cared about what you werein for. Actually, there weren’t many child molesters back then-childmolestations, while they’ve always been around are infinitely more common thesedays than back then--but as long as they minded their business no one reallybothered them or cared what they’d done. I can only remember knowing of oneinmate who was a convicted child molester and nobody bothered him or much caredwhat he was in for. To be honest, a large number of people incarcerated havedrinking or drug problems and when they’re on the sauce or high, prettyroutinely abuse their own kids.2. Inmates hate convicted cops.            Again, hooey. The few copsthat were in the joint with me had more friends than anyone else, on average.The thing is, cops and outlaws interact with each other all the time on thebricks--at least the professional criminals do--and most of us like and evenrespect each other. There’s a very fine line between being a cop and acriminal, in my opinion. We’re both adrenaline junkies and is one of the chiefreasons we become what we are in these two “career fields.” When I was “in thelife” I used to hang out almost every night at a slop shop in downtown SouthBend, before I went to “work,” and half the people there were off-duty cops andhalf were outlaws. We all got along well and if one of those guys got sent up,we were still friends.3. Inmates claim to be innocent.            This is probably thebiggest myth of all. Nobody claims to be innocent in the joint--even those fewwho are. If you were innocent and said so to other inmates, they would takethat as a sign of weakness and you’d be in trouble. Where that comes from iswhen a reporter or researcher interviews an inmate, very often they’ll sing hima sad tale of woe about being bumrapped. The reason is, no matter how guiltythe person is, once you’re inside, all hope has vanished. To be interviewed,especially by a sympathetic listener, the hope rises that enough bleedinghearts will read the article or see the show and be moved to do something toget the guy liberated. That it doesn’t happen doesn’t destroy the hope--theyknow it’s a long shot anything like that will happen, but it’s a glimmer of ahope and so they bring their acting chops to the table--probably even claim tohave one of those b.s. “jailhouse conversions” and hope somehow their “story”(and that’s usually what it is--a story)--will affect the right people’s heartsand a miracle will happen. I only knew one person when I was in who was trulyinnocent and there’s no way he would have claimed that to other inmates unlesshe really trusted they wouldn’t tell anyone else. That’d be suicide. In fact,when those who appear in documentaries and TV shows claim their innocence, theinstant they’re back in the cellhouse they make sure to let everyone know theywere just pulling a shuck.            Another thing they don’tpublicize as it would destroy the common misconception. Of all those people whoget freed from prison after an investigation or new trial, probably 90-somepercent aren’t freed because they were found innocent. They’re freed because ofa legal technicality. You can look that up.            For points #1 and #2, what Isuspect has happened to lead to the hatred for child molesters and cops insidethe walls is what has happened in just about all the instances ofmisconceptions about convicts. I think what’s happened is that movies and themedia romanticized this (inmates hating and killing child molesters) andinmates bought into this image of themselves for a variety of reasons–-atypical reason being that people in prison are just plain looking for any kindof excuse to shank someone and this is as good a reason as any and even kind ofmakes the guy shanking a child molester look like a good or moral guy.            The same thing happened withthe cops being in danger in the joint myth. Some individual somewhere told areporter that and the naive reporter (there’s a lot of those folks!) reportedit as gospel and just like the child molester myth, that just gave cons anexcuse to shank someone and feel “moral.” Now, of course, thanks to televisionand the movies, convicted cops are in danger.            Even worse is the image MSNBC-NEWSis portraying in their prison series of criminals. If a person was to believewhat they see on those shows, they’d assume the average inmate is an obsessedweight-lifter or a raging psycho who spends his day fingerpainting with fecesbetween meetings with the Aryan Nation or Black Panthers or Mexican Mafia andlearning the secret handshake. And, they’re all doing life… This series ishelping create the biggest misconception of criminals in the history ofmedia--the mindset that doesn’t understand the difference between drama andmelodrama, except to know that melodrama boosts ratings.            The truth is, if you put the averagecellblock population in a mall food court, nobody would look twice. You’d justsee folks mostly like your neighbors. Actually, most of those in jail were your neighbors at one time.            This is why noir rocks. We see a fargreater number of realistic characters in their pages. This is also why it hassuffered as a genre for so long. It’s too truthful for some. My experience isthat the average person is fascinated by criminals… so long as they can appearto get close but get none of that criminality nastiness on themselves. When thecriminal mind is accurately depicted, they begin to sense that these guysaren’t as different as they thought.            That’s scary.            And makes for great literature.*                                                          *                                                          *            There’s one other thing that noirhas going for itself. It isn’t all that concerned with that abomination calledbeing “politically correct.” That, in itself, is a compelling reason to readand write it.Blue skies,Les"},

{"title": "Review for THE DEATH OF TARPONS", "date": "Wednesday, March 29, 2017", "text": "HI folks,A really thoughtful article about my first novel, The Death of Tarpons, just came out yesterday from the Betimes Books blog. The writer, Hannah Keane, really did a bang-up job and one of the things that impacted me emotionally was how she came up with photos from my hometown of Freeport, Texas where the story was set, one in particular, the shot of the Tarpon Inn which I saw every day of my life. It was at the end of the town square where my grandmother's bar and taxi company sat. They say a picture is worth a 1,000 words and in this case it was for me. The day that photo was shot, I know I had looked at the building as I did every day. It put me right there and I could smell the shrimp in the air and just evoked a powerful, powerful memory!Here's Hannah Keane's article:The Death of Tarpons: A Journey into darknessBy HannahKeaneOn theoccasion of the new release of Les Edgerton’s debut novel, The Death of Tarpons, in paperback format by Betimes Books and in electronic format by Endeavour Press, we aretaking a look back at what makes Edgerton’s first work of fiction so special.For something which, at first glance, seems so different from his later works,how does it fit so seamlessly in Edgerton’s body of work?Firstpublished in 1996, The Death of Tarponsstands out in Edgerton’s repertoire for how different in tone it is from his subsequentnovels. To many, Edgerton is known as an acclaimed crime writer,but his most loyal fans will also know that he has never wanted to limithimself – or be limited – to one genre of writing: from short story collectionslike Monday’s Meal to young adultfiction such as Mirror, Mirror andplenty of non-fiction, Edgerton has explored writing in its many forms.Consequently,it should come as no surprise that Edgerton’s first piece of writing is atouching coming-of-age story about a young teenage boy trying to build a betterrelationship with his father. “Then, last year, Igot this fantastic idea to do something totally on my own, in secret, thatwould show him once and for all I could do something mechanical. Manly. Then, hewould love me and be proud of me and put his arm around me. I decided to builda boat. For him.”This soundsas far removed as possible from other works like The Rapist or Just Like Thatbut, as one reviewer and fellow author has mentioned, the seeds of Edgerton’slater fiction can indeed be found here.“Edgerton’s laternovels have become Noir classics to many, and ‘The Death of Tarpons’ hints at amoonless childhood that explains the author’s successful literary journeys intodarkness.” – Jack Getze, Spinetingler Magazine, 2017In The Death of Tarpons, young Coreycertainly encounters many episodes of darkness. Nearly all of the personalrelationships around him are afflicted with violent outbursts or psychologicalabuse: the regular beatings of his best friend, Destin, and his mother at thehands of his drunken father; the violent reprimands Corey endures from his ownfather as well as the emotional neglect he and his mother receive from Corey’sfather – a neglect that has driven his mother to religious fanaticism. “Every atom in my bodywas in fear. I had never seen such a look on his face as there was now, noteven at his angriest. It was like the face of God Himself, the face the fireand brimstone preacher Mom listened to, conjured up, Sunday mornings.”Thus, thedarkness one would expect from Edgerton’s work is present in his debut;however, it is tempered by the sweet nature of its protagonist and the lovingrelationship Corey has with his grandpa. What allowsEdgerton to write across different genres with such success is something thatall his works have in common: an honesty that can only come from personalexperience. Edgerton has described TheDeath of Tarpons as being “85% autobiographical” and as being a work whichwas long in the making, having started writing it at the age of fifteen. Thesetting of the novel – 1950s era Freeport, Texas – was a place where Edgertonspent part of his childhood and many characters are drawn from real life with,for example, the author’s own grandmother being just as successful and driven abusinesswoman as the Grandma character featured in the novel. Just asEdgerton’s own experience as an ex-con gives a realistic edge to his crimefiction, the same truthfulness can be found in his debut. “The Oyster Bar. Thebusiness that had sustained three generations, mine and my sister Doc’s, myparents, and my grandparents. The business that, along with the taxi cabcompany, my grandmother had created and ruled as her own private fiefdom. Notwith some metaphoric iron hand, but with a very real Navy Colt long-barreled.45 on the dash of her taxi”.Honesty andcredibility are what make Edgerton’s writings so distinctive and evocative.When reading The Death of Tarpons,one can really visualise what it was like being a young boy, just out on summervacation with lots of great plans for how he was going to spend the holidayshanging out with his best friend, fishing with his grandpa and getting closerto his dad. “All the way downtown,I used lawns, head down, alert for nettles and stickers. When I had to cross astreet, leave the coolness of grass, I ran faster, landing on different partsof the soles of my feet. First-day-of-summer-vacation-tootsies were too whiteand thin-skinned for concrete baked at ninety-plus degrees.”As with therest of Edgerton’s work, the vividness of his characters and settings is aresult of his personal knowledge of what it was like to be a young teenage boygrowing up at this time in the American South. The credibility that comes fromwriting about places and situations one is familiar with is what gives The Death of Tarpons, as well asEdgerton’s other novels, a distinctive edge.

He had to leave the U.S. as he couldn't survive on his S.S. and went to Guatemala, but between the civil war going on and the outlaws and a still-high cost of living, he recently left to go live in Mexico where he is currently. He tells me the cost of living is half what it was in Guatemala and infinitely safer!Yesterday was his birthday (75) and he sent me this poem which I'd like to share with you. He'd just colored his beard and was bummed out the ladies weren't complimenting him on it.

{"title": "First Review for THE DEATH OF TARPONS", "date": "Tuesday, November 22, 2016", "text": "HI folks,Received the first review of my novel, THE DEATH OF TARPONS, just released from Endeavour Books (UK) and their Odyssey imprint, their new imprint for literary works. Hope others will pick it up and take the time to provide a review. This one for sure made my day!5.0 out of 5 starsA beautiful tale of heart-ache and redemptionBy Gerald O'Connor on 11 Nov. 2016Verified PurchaseThe Death of Tarpons by Les Edgerton is a coming-of-age book set in Freeport, Texas in 1955. It tells the story of Corey John, who, on facing his own death, returns to his hometown and recounts the harrowing days of a pivotal summer in his life when he was fourteen years of age. I read this story in one four-hour sitting, and, as a fan of Mark Twain, found it absurdly enjoyable for the similar tone and styles Edgerton employs. The voice is almost autobiographical, and the prose is evocative and rich without ever being stilted. The story itself appears simple at first, but the minute I read a few pages I was drawn in by the character of young Corey and the world and times of the setting.Corey John lives in a house where his mother is slowly losing her mind to religion and his father physically abuses him. Despite this, Corey is desperate for his father’s love, and dreams of doing anything to become the man his father wishes he were. There’s such an obvious mismatch between father and son, and the conflict that arises from this is both brutal and painful to read. Every time the young boy attempts to please his father something happens to drive them further apart, and the violence that erupts is vicious at times. Even though the logic and worlds of Corey and his father are completely incompatible, you always have this hankering for them to unite. This constant push-and-pull created a tug of war in my head. The way Edgerton wrote this, I couldn’t help but side with both the kid and dad at various times, and as such it made for an uncomfortable read. But this no negative. Certainly not. It is what makes it so sweet. The story pulls no punches, showing parents and kids as real people with a bit of good and bad in them and all the bits in between. Edgerton presents the world as it is without any of that saccharin sweetness that seems to pervade literature and film these days.The structure of the book is also worth noting. The first and last chapters are set in present day, book-ending the main story-line to create a very satisfying conclusion. By setting the book up in this manner, the tale of fourteen-year-old Corey appears to be no more than a fleeting thought in the older man’s mind. And yet we get to spend time in Freeport with the Texas sun and Jax Beer and Corey and his friend Destin and their maid Inez and it all feels wonderfully real.In the end, The Death of Tarpons is about a boy on the cusp of manhood, finding redemption and strength in himself amidst a world full of violence and good. It may be set in older times, but it’s relevance is timeless. For all these reasons, I thoroughly enjoyed this book, and I highly recommend it to all."},
{"title": "PUBLICATION DAY FOR THE DEATH OF TARPONS!", "date": "Thursday, November 10, 2016", "text": "Hi folks,Just found out Endeavour Press (UK) and their literary imprint, Odyssey Press has released my first novel, THE DEATH OF TARPONS, for sale as an ebook. This is the first time it's been available as an ebook, previously available only as a hardcover edition.It's priced very equitably at $3.99 in the U.S. and the equivalent in the UK. Not only am I stoked that it's now available as an ebook, but that it's one of the first to be published on Endeavour's new literary books imprint. As Endeavour is Europe's biggest publisher of ebook titles, I'm hoping it gains wide sales. If you purchase a copy, please consider leaving a review on Amazon and Goodreads and other such venues.I'm really proud of this book. It's largely autobiographical and was written before I ever took a writing class of any kind. It's my wife Mary's favorite book of those I've written. I have to thank my agent, Svetlana Pironko for selling the ebook version. She's also placed the paperback version with Betimes Books and that'll be forthcoming soon.A bit of history--in the mid-nineties when I sent it out, it went through 86 rejections. This was in the days of snail mail when you had to not only pay postage to send it to publishers, you also had to pay for return postage in the event of rejection. That was a lot of money, especially for our family which was living day-to-day and sweating out rent. If it wasn't for the faith and support of my wife Mary, I wouldn't have been able to persevere in trying to get it published. Perhaps that's why she loves it so much--she knows the sacrifices we made to get it out there.Actually, at about the 50th submission, I got a letter from a regional publisher who wanted it and offered a $10,000 advance for it. That was huge money for me at the time and sorely needed. However, I ended up turning it down. The reason? He asked me if it was autobiographical and I told him about 85% of it was but not all of it. He wanted to publish it as autobiography and in good conscience, I couldn't do it. The real clincher for not taking his offer though was that he wanted to cut several scenes, notably one in which the young protagonist's father beats him with a live king snake. This was in the days before even the term \"political correctness\" had been coined, so I'm proud to say I had good instincts about this odious concept, even then. He wanted to cut it because... ready?... it might offend the snake lovers... Which must be what? Five or six people? That kind of did it... (Very) reluctantly, I withdrew the book from him. Then, as now, money has never been my goal.For a long while, it looked as if I'd made the dumbest mistake of my life. We went through dozens and dozens of other rejections after that. In fact, it was the  87th submission that finally got taken.And, that was the result of two fortuitous events.One: A couple of weeks before it got taken, I was privileged to have the mss of The Death of Tarpons accepted for a workshop in Indianapolis to be held by Mary Evans. Mary is an Indy native and was back home to give a talk and to conduct the workshop for five of us lucky writers.During the workshop, Mary pulled me aside and told me it was a truly brilliant novel, but that she guessed I was having trouble selling it. Surprised at her insight, I told her it was and she explained why. She said her own client, Michael Chabron, had experienced the same thing she figured I was going through with his own first novel, The Mysteries of Pittsburg. That publishers assumed it was a YA just because it had a teenaged protagonist. I was shocked. \"But, Mary,\" I said. \"I've never thought of it as a YA at all. Any more than I would call John Knowles' A Separate Peace a YA novel.\" She agreed, but then gave me a bit of priceless education about publishing. She told me that editors and publishers weren't always the smartest folks around. She said that as soon as they saw a teenaged protagonist, their limited imaginations just automatically put it into a category. And, not only were they seeing it was a YA, they were seeing it as a book aimed at the single worst category for readers--teenaged boys. It's the worst demographic in literature--or, at least it was then in pre-Harry Potter days--as teenaged boys didn't read. While they were the single biggest demographic for movies, they were the single worst for books.She then gave me the biggest and most useful piece of practical advice I've ever been given in publishing. She advised me to do what she'd advised Michael Chabron to do in the face of similar pigeon-holing. \"Just make it a frame book, and you'll get it published,\" she said. Being young and ignorant, I didn't have a clue what a frame book was so she had to explain it in baby language. I learned that all I needed to do was to add two chapters, a new Chapter 1 and a new ending chapter. In Chapter 1, I needed to begin it as an adult looking back on his life, and in the last chapter, simply bring the narrative back to his adulthood.And, that's what I did. I created a new beginning, making Corey John  an adult, dying of cancer, revisiting his boyhood home of Freeport, Texas and reliving a particularly bad memory of one tumultuous summer. At the end, I brought him back to that place. In between these two editions, I just stuck the original novel. That was it. All of a sudden, I'd transformed a YA into an adult novel...That was the first event.The second was that I sent it to the University of North Texas Press. This will give you a clue as to how many places I'd sent it to, as I sent it out alphabetically to publishers. A press beginning with \"U\" is kind of near the end of that list... In fact, I'd already made up my mind to never send it out again once I hit 100 places. I'm not sure there were even 14 places left on my list...What I wasn't aware of was that the University of North Texas Press had never before in their history published any fiction. It shouldn't have even been considered and under normal circumstances wouldn't have been. However, Providence was present that day. The publisher, Fran Vick, had come into her office to begin going through the mound of manuscripts on her desk. As it happened, mine happened to be on top, the first one. Coming through the door to bring her her morning coffee, her assistant tripped and spilled the cup. She apologized and went out to get her another cup.During that two or three minutes, with nothing to do, Fran idly picked up my manuscript and began idly reading. Well, one of the first things she encountered on the page were the words \"Freeport, Texas.\" This was in my new version with the new frame chapter. Seeing those two words gained her interest. That was simply because that's where Fran was from--where she'd grown up.She told me all this later. She said she began reading the next page and then the next and before she knew it she was hooked and knew they had to publish it. She gave it to her editor, Charlotte Wright, who liked it as well as Fran did. And, they published and it went on to garner a Special Citation from the Violet Crown Book Awards, a big deal in Texas literary circles. And, nominateed for a hunch of other great awards. Got to attend the First Annual Texas Book Festival and sit with Laura Bush and a bunch of really cool Texas writers and dignitaries.The point is, absent a chance meeting with probably the only literary agent who had had experience with my kind of book and the kind of problem it was facing, and without a clumsy secretary's spilling coffee (thank you!), and without a publisher being from my own home town and seeing that on the first page, this book would have died. You just never know what little twist of fate will occur that aids in your work being seen by the right person.Anyway, this kind of the story of this novel and I hope you at least found it interesting if not informative.Thanks for considering buying my book!Blue skies,LesP.S. One more anecdote... my original title was \"Spatterdashers\" and it killed me when UNT Press insisted on not using it. Particulary, since the term was the reason I'd even written the book! I'd come across the word in a Paris Review interview and loved it from the initial encounter. Literally, it denoted an item of clothing men used to wear; a legging that \"prevented spatter from dashing their trousers.\" Over time, usage reduced the word to \"spats.\" The reason Fran told me they wouldn't use it because people wouldn't know what it meant. Reluctantly, I bowed to her and she was gracious in letting me pick the alternative title, The Death of Tarpons.A few months after it came out, Gore Vidal published a book titled, \"Palimsest.\" \"Hey!\" I asked Fran. How about this? Vidal has a book out titled Palimsest. That's even more obscure than Spatterdashers.\" She looked at me cooly and said, \"Well, he's Gore Vidal... and you're not.\"She had a point..."},

{"title": "OPENINGS IN MY ONLINE NOVEL-WRITING CLASS", "date": "Tuesday, October 18, 2016", "text": "Hifolks,Well,we’re just finishing up our final week on the current session of my onlinenovel-writing class, “Les Edgerton’s Bootcamp for Writers,” and find ourselveswith the rarity of a couple of openings. Our next session will begin on October30 and consists of a ten-week session, with the probability of taking a weekoff sometime during the term to recharge batteries.With some of my online writing class members in Arizona.Thisis a call for new class members. Not sure how many openings we’ll have as weoffer vacancies first to our auditors.Thebasics are the course costs $400 and it’s limited to ten people. The $400 isnonrefundable, as if a person quits during the session it would be impossibleto fill that vacancy. As this is my primary source of income, it would bedetrimental for myself and my family. It’s very rare that anyone opts out oncebegun, however. In over five years, there have only been two.We’vehad a remarkable history of success. Nearly everyone over the past five yearswho has become a part of our class has gone on to being legitimately publishedand/or secured a good literary agent. In fact, that is our only goal—to becomelegitimately published.Belowis a letter I posted from a student who has since gone on to publish her fourthbook to critical acclaim, impressive sales, and award nominations. Her firstthree novels were written in class. Her words are as true today as they wereseveral years ago and will give you a former classmate’s take on the class.Froma student:We just started a new session for myongoing internet class on novel writing. We’ve got a couple of new studentsthis time—most writers keep re-upping each time but occasionally one or twowill drop out for various reasons: demands of a new job not allowing them tocommit the considerable time that is required to participate, needing time offto address the notes their new agent just gave them for the novel he signed,and so on. Most just keep on, even after they’ve gotten an agent and/or sold theirnovel, and begin writing a new one. Almost all who stick out the entire sessioncome back. The ones who quit usually quit fairly soon into the class. It’s notfor everyone. Nobody holds anybody’s hand and every single one of us is focusedon but one thing—helping each other write a novel that’s publishable. It’s a toughgame and not for everyone.From Les:I try to warn people who arethinking of joining us, how tough the class is, but I know from past experiencethat even so forewarned, at least some are going to be in for a shock when theysee that we really don’t hold hands, pat people on the back for minimumefforts, or overlook writing that doesn’t work. I’m not cruel (at least I don’tthink so) nor are any of the oldtimers in class, but most new folks haven’tbeen exposed to a class like ours. The truth is, most writers who haven’t had aclass like ours have been praised in other classes or most likely, has been inclasses that use the “sandwich” method of teaching. You know—that deal wherethe teach applies a bit of praise, then a bit of criticism, and then a bit ofpraise. Well, that ain’t our shtick. Not even close. The comments we allprovide on everyone’s work fit one definition only. They’re honest.This isn’t to be mean or to act likewe’re the only folks around who know what good writing is. Except… we do know. I’mnot aware of any other class out there with the kind of track record oursenjoys. Virtually every writer who stays the course with us ends up with a topagent and/or a book deal. That doesn’t happen in a single ten-week session.About the earliest anyone has earned an agent or book deal in our class hasbeen about a year. And, that’s reasonable.The thing is, our writers don’texpect things to be easy.From a student several years ago:Hi ________. Since Les opened thefloor for comments from the \"class veterans\" I'm chipping in with mytwo cents. I have a file cabinet filled with stuff I sent Les and then neededasbestos gloves to take the paper off the printer. When I started this journey,I'd never taken an English class past high school. (I was pre-med in college) Ifigured I love to read, so how hard can it be? Okay, quit laughing at me.Clearly, when I wrote my first version of my first novel, I had no idea aboutstory structure, POV, any of that. I figured I'm pretty articulate andtherefore I can write?Les quickly set me straight. All ofthis is to point out that we've all been on the receiving end of Les' brutalhonesty. I will find some of the comments he made on my work and post them butphrases like \"throwing up in my mouth now\" and \"bury this sodeep in the yard no one ever finds it\" are seared into my brain and Idon't have to look to find those!!! The point is, I took other classes before Imet Les and the teachers were kind and gentle and never told me I sucked. If itweren't for Les, I'd still be churning out awful drivel that makes people wantto throw up instead of trying not to throw up while I wait to see if my agentis able to sell my book. I would never have gotten an agent without Les. Sohang in there. Listen to everything he says and if it doesn't make sense, askaway.The novel that I am currently tryingto sell has been a work in progress since 2009. The first time Les saw it hesent it back and told me to re-write the WHOLE thing!!! My character was a wimp.She sat back and let things happen to her. I argued a little, rewrote a littleand then moved on to another book. After a year, I went back and reread it andsaw the truth. It was awful. So I took a deep breath and started over. Pageone. First sentence. Re-wrote the entire thing. It took a full year and then Irevised it again. It's definitely a process. But once you get the Incitingincident and the outline steps down pat, it's a whole lot easier. Trust me!!!And you'll never graduate completely. A few months ago, Les and I wenthead-to-head on one single passage. I was trying to be lazy and take the easyway out. He called me on it and I resubmitted three or four weeks in a row,revisions on the same passage. I was sure my classmates were so sick of it theywere going to stick needles in their eyes rather than read it again! But in theend, the passage rocked!! So hang in there!!!! It'll get better. (Note: Thisnovel sold and the writer is currently working on her fifth novel.)From Les:Ifigured I’d let some of the class members give you their take on our class.They don’t hold back and they all have tough skins. They will all tell you thesame thing. It isn’t a class for sissies or for those who need their hands heldor lots of pats on the back. Becoming published is hard, hard work and isn’t anundertaking for sissies. To get there, our students know they have to put ontheir Big Boy and Big Girl pants and expect to work harder than they ever havein their lives—and to never, ever “settle” their standards of excellence.Classmembers come from all over the globe. We’ve had students from the UK, Ireland,Taiwan, Spain, all parts of the U.S., Canada, Australia, Luxembourg and manyother places. We work with writers in virtually every genre on the bookshelves.Theway class works is that the class is divided into two equal groups. We used tohave just one group, but it got to be too much for many students. In the past,everybody in the class was required to read everybody else’s work each week andprovide in-depth comments on everyone’s work. That meant they had to read nineother class members’ work and deliver intelligent commentary on each one. We’vesince evolved to a more manageable number where now each class member reads anddelivers comments on just four other classmates’ work. I provide comments oneverybody’s work and that’s why the class is limited to only ten. With tenwriters, I can give each person the quality of time and analysis each deserves.Eachweek begins on Sunday evening, when people can begin submitting their weeklypages from Sunday until Thursday. If it’s a new writer to the class, they areallowed to submit their first five pages of their novel, plus an outline whichconsists of five statements and a total of 15-20 words. Oldtimers in class callthis “inciting incident hell.” If the outline isn’t working and their beginningdoesn’t represent the inciting incident as provided in their outline, they arerequired to keep submitting each week until it does. Our feeling is if theyhaven’t thought through their novels sufficiently and provided a publishablenovel structure (evidenced by the outline), then they most likely don’t have anovel ready to be written and to simply plunge ahead will almost invariably leadto an unfinished novel. We don’t want that.Oncethey’ve been okayed for the beginning, from thereafter they can submit up toeight pages per week, along with the others in class.Timezones don’t matter. Everybody’s work, including everyone’s comments and my owncomments on each person’s work each week is posted on the class site and folkscan go to it any time of the day or night. Class members can begin sending backtheir comments on each others’ in their group from Sunday through the followingSunday, when it begins again. Although, in practicality, most members send intheir work each week on Wednesdays and Thursdays. It’s like being in an “on-ground”class in that everything said or done in class is seen by everybody.Wedo have a chat function and people use it all the time, even though they’re indifferent time zones. One of the best things about this class is that we havelots of oldtimers who know from their own experience what works in a novel andwhat doesn’t and more importantly… whyit works or doesn’t work. It’s like having a group of seven or eight otherprofessionals helping you with your own novel. Probably at any given time inclass, there will be four or five who already have had a novel or severalpublished as a result of being in class, so it’s a really rarified group. And,if you think that you couldn’t operate in a situation like this because you’rea beginner, that simply isn’t the case here at all. Nearly every single personin each class began just the way you did, as a rank beginner. And, theyremember and they have complete empathy for your situation, if you’re abeginning writer.It’snot a situation of simply saying, “This doesn’t work.” Myself and others inclass will surely say that, but we then let you know why it didn’t work andgive you solid suggestions on how to make it work. We collectively have anurturing nature and all of us want the newcomer to succeed just about as badlyas that writer wants to.Ifyou are still interested but still feel intimidated, I think if you simply lookat how the class works, you’ll quickly see how you’ll fit in comfortably. Sincewe’ve got one week left in class, for anyone who would like to see up close andpersonal how we work as a class, I’d be delighted to give you auditor statusfor our last week. Besides class members, we also have an auditor functionwhich works the same as it does in a “regular” college class. You’re admittedto class and can view every single thing we’re doing and the entire classsession is archived and easy to access. Normally, the cost of auditing theclass is $50, but for our last week, for those interested in simply getting alook at how we work, just email me at butchedgerton@comcast.netand let me know and I’ll have our class administrator, Holly, get you on boardasap.Iknow there are no doubt a lot of questions you may have. Please feel free tocontact me at any time and ask me anything you’d like.Frompast experience, when we’ve had openings like this, they go quickly, so if youare interested, please get in touch, okay?Forthose interested in such things, here are a few of my own qualifications toteach writing.MFAin Writing from Vermont CollegeTaughtwriting for the UCLA Writer’s ProgramTaughtwriting via Skype for the New York Writer’s WorkshopWriter-in-Residencefor three years for the University of ToledoWriter-in-Residencefor one year for Trine UniversityTaughtwriting classes for St. Francis UniversityTaughtwriting classes for Phoenix CollegeTaughtwriting for Writer’s Digest Online ClassesTaughtwriting classes for Vermont CollegePublished18 books, including craft books on writing, novels, sports books, YA novel,historical nonfiction book, humor nonfiction, black comedy novel, noir,thrillers, literary and existential fiction.Dozensof short stories published in such publications as The South Carolina Review, HighPlains Literary Review, Aethlon, Flatmancrooked, Murdaland and many others.Many private clients who published books I worked with them on, including such writers as Robert Rotstein, Michelle Corasanti, Janey Mack, Maegan Beaumont and many others.Alot of living… much of it as an outlaw…Blueskies,Les Debut novel from Gerald O'Connor one of our class members from Ireland.

{"title": "WILLIAM JOYCE INTERVIEW BY RICHARD GODWIN", "date": "Sunday, October 16, 2016", "text": "Hi folks,Most of you know I'm a huge fan of a living literary legend, William Joyce. Happily, today an interview he did with Richard Godwin just came out on Richard's interview site, Chin Wag at the Slaughterhouse, a must-see stop on the literary trail. Here's what William had to say:·        ·Quick Fire At The Slaughterhouse:Interview With William JoycePosted on October16, 2016 by richardgodwinWilliam JoyceWilliam Joyce has had an intensive literary career whosevicissitudes exemplify the shallow fickleness of the industry. This is a writerwho knew Norman Mailer, and who wrote a first novel, First Born Of An Ass, thatbaffled the reviewers, not hard given their restricted reader’s skills, and hecarried on. That is what writers do especially those who challenge society.William met me at The Slaughterhouse, where we talked about his place in theAmerican legacy and the tethering of literature by social conditioning.What is your enduring relationship as a writer with the Americanlegacy?Enduring?? I don’thave enough money for next month’s rent so my relationship with the Americanlegacy is the least of my concerns. I’m hoping to ENDURE without sleeping onthe street.But since youmentioned it, which “America” are you talking about? There’s the U.S. “America”which has misappropriated the name and there’s the continent America namedafter America Vespucci, an Italian cartographer.If you’re talkingabout the U.S., as soon as I die–shortly– the academics will build a statue tome, and put me in the Pantheon of Buster Keaton, W.C. Fields, and CharlieChaplin. As long as they erect an emaciated statue, I’ll be happy.But if you’re talkingabout the continent America, I identify just as much with Eduardo Galeano asW.C. Fields or Henry Miller. That would also be true with another dozen LatinAmerican and West Indian writers like Aime Cesaire, Vallejo, Rulfo, Asturias,and Jose Donoso.To what extent do you think America and Europe now are tetheredby social conditioning and a failure to appreciate breakthrough literature, ifyou think of the effect Henry Miller had on the literary establishment, and howmuch was your novel First Born an anarchic assault on those limitingsensibilities?Well, I think thedifference between now and then is that Henry Miller’s Tropic of Cancer hadeloquent defenders. There was in Europe and the U.S. in 1935, or 1960, anaristocracy of critics who had the confidence to take on any book, no matterhow low-life, and articulate its vitality. These connosseurs of what is best inthe written word do not exist now.First Born of an Ass had no such defenders. In 1989 when it cameout, there were book reviewers who applauded the novel but no one who reallytook its measure. It was “breakthrough” in the sense that it used apparentlosers to define a way of life in a particular setting, the steel mill towns ofWestern Pennsylvania.What also made itbreakthrough was that like Tropic it disparaged the entire the entire set ofbourgeoise values. Art, thrift, cleanliness, progress, education,respectability all are washed down the drain.All of these“Breakthrough” books have another thing in common–The Body. Donleavy’s TheGinger Man, Tropic of Cancer, and First Born of an Ass never get far away fromthe body. If Tropic could be said to be one large stomach, First Born is nothingbut one sprawling intestine. It is the world viewed from the digestiveapparatus.This is the last thingthe Modern World of isms and sects wants to hear. The Bible, the Koran, theTalmud, deny the body. It is always suspect. With its unpredictability, itneeds to be reigned in, harnessed, covered up. All of literary censorship ispredicated upon this. If the body can be denied, it can be used as a tool toperpetuate profits and a slice of propaganda.The most importantthing about Breakthrough Writing is that a lot of the time it is funny. Andonce you have people laughing, they’re going to look around and see theabsurdity of their own situation. Then, they kick off their high-heels, orloosen their neckties, become slightly human. Now the writing is a threat.A long time ago, therewere men, and occasionally women, who saw all this and in a leisurely fashionwrote about the joy and insights they got from such unpredictable material. Nosuch arbiters exist today and it is one of the reasons humans are becomingjunkies at an unprecedented rate. What we have in place of excellence is thevoice of the Mob. And there is hardly anything they don’t know.Do you think that Art and literature are being increasinglyrepressed by social engineering and the rise of the far right and itsChristianising tendencies in the US and what is the antidote?Repression? SocialEngineering?? Whatever is going on it has made people dumb. In all thecountries people are so dumb it’s a wonder they’re alive.In 1966, RobertoRosselini, the pioneer Italian film director, said in an interview that Europewas headed toward an infantile society. We’re there now. Billions of peoplejust waiting to be fed, no sign of life anywhere.Look, if an educatedman has the choice of eating a pizza or reading a good book, he’ll take thepizza. The pizza has taste right away whereas the good book takes work. Youhave to bring something to the book–desire, a sense of adventure, a willingnessto explore; the reader has to have energy. Ahhh, but with the pizza you needonly open your mouth. Bingo! Everything is taken care of. All you need isdollars or euros and You’re set. And dollars or euros is all that most peoplehave. Desire was flushed long ago into the gearboxes of nasty machines.The problem is thatthe wheat for the dough in the pizza is full of GMOs. The tomato sauce isloaded up with a chemical preservative to give it longer shelf life. The cheesecomes from a cow that had its ass shot full of hormones to promote quickergrowth of the befuddled animal.The body doesn’t knowwhat to do with all these chemicals. all this sludge. So the pizza just sits inthe guy’s gut in various stages of putrefaction while the body tries to arriveat a verdict. When the autopsy was done on John Wayne, they found 36 pounds offeces. The great defender of law and order and he’s dragging around all thisshit while 50 million people across the Earth scream, “That John Wayne, he’s myhero, he doesn’t take shit from anybody.” Well, he just happens to take a lotof shit from the whole food network which is supposed to keep him alive but infact is responsible only to a group of shareholders.The guy who justgobbled the pizza doesn’t care about all this. The next morning he wakesfeeling pregnant when he liked to feel nice and light. He tries to relieve thisbloatedness by yelling at the wife and kids but they’re bloated too and yellright back. It’s called The Great American Family. Everybody hoping to make AStupendous Crap in the hoity-toity-ha-ha-ka-ka Craperia Room so they can go outand buy more pizzas. Papa then goes to work–usually in some office building–where anger is not permitted. At lunch in the company cafeteria, someone blamesall the problems on the Commie government, a second guy says, No, it’s theJewish bankers. A third party blames all the problems on the Armenian faggots,they’re the ones who’ve taken over the schools. The conversation has inflamedthe original pizza guy. It’s tapped his adrenal gland and he rushes off to theRest Room where if you were ever caught just resting, security would haul youoff for serious questioning.A modest bowelmovement and the pizza guy feels a bit lighter. “Maybe it is those Armenianfaggots” he says to the mirror as he washes his hands.There’s always beenSocial Engineering going on. In 1850 Alexander Herzen said about Russia that 52adults were waiting for the infant to plop out of the womb. If your own life’sa failure, you can always give advice. But humans prepare for this socialengineering by eating a lot of ballast. That way they’re passive and can bemolded this way or that way. They don’t want freedom which is what the artistrepresents; they want to be weighted down… with pizzas, with slogans, any kindof crap will do. Pursuing freedom takes too much work, too much vigilance.Better to be half comatose and relaxed–cool it, chill out–than all flighty,flapping one’s wings toward a distant chimera.Whether it’s thesocial engineering in 1491 from Uncle Ephraim or the technological variety now,there’s always a constant. There’s something that’s inherent in humans that’salways looking for a shortcut to happiness. In 1492, Isabella and Ferdinandwere looking for a shortcut to the Spice Islands so they sent explorers west inwooden ships. No spices but Indians who had lots of gold and silver. In 1849,More gold at Sutter’s Mill in California and this discovery made half the worldinsane at so much riches in one tiny locale. 75 years later it was liquid goldand people went mad at the thought of a model-A Ford that could power themright up to heaven. Led Zepplin has a lot to say about this. Now it’s a host oftechnological devices that are supposed to make people feel Connected but justa glance around and you see that people are totally disconnected. They can’tsee and they can’t hear. They just poke and pray and wait for the next pizza.So I don’t think it’sa matter of repression. Humans have been gutted by seven centuries of lookingfor a shortcut when paradise was often right next to them, within them. Veryfew have ever been willing to serve that 10 to 15 years apprenticeship thatwould have taught them contentment and often ecstasy. They’d rather buy a pillby that name.What is called art orliterature is nothing more than a record of an individual’s participation inthe comedy called life. Language has been so reduced in its resonance thatwords are now taken literally. Comedians in the U.S. no longer enter collegecampuses because they say students take everything literally. That means desireis gone. The body has retreated into a shell. Dead at 18, waiting for theteacher to get them down the road to the next Holiday Inn. The far right or farleft or Christian evangelists are just examples of polemicized mobs who takeeverything literally. Who are ready to kill if they don’t get their dailyumbilical transfer of pizza. All the groups, when they see that pizza, smokingfrom the oven, scream, “AWESOME!”The antidote??? Hide.How would you introduce your work to a new readership?Well, there’s a directtie-in with your previous questions.Given the quagmire theEarth is in now and the fact that most countries are police states run bycorporations, if I wanted readers I’d have to find rebels, people fed up. This hasalready happened. How did you and I meet? Through Les Edgerton. And who is LesEdgerton?Well, he’s more than arebel. He’s put his body on the line. He’s done time. He’s worked the streetswhich means he knows what it takes to get a job done. And he’s not going to befooled by rhetoric–he’s not living out of his head. He’s also done the hardreading; he can decipher the difference between art and the con job calledPrize Winners. He’s not going to be fooled by the Noir crowd, nor any genre forthat matter.The funny thing isthat before I met Edgerton I dreamed of meeting Edgerton. I knew I neededsomeone like Edgerton, someone who as a child had rooted for the Bad Guys inmovies. I knew 10 years ago I couldn’t get along with straight people.Straight people don’tget it. They don’t get anything. They have no idea of Charlie Mingus or MilesDavis. Their parents’ idea of a good time on Saturday night was to watchLawrence Welk on the teevee and they’ve followed suit. Straight people don’thave that little hitch in their giddyup, that savvy on what it takes to get theday started. They’re content to poke at some machine.In the old days, therewere publishers who had this sixth sense of how to get a book rolling. BarneyRosset of the old Grove Press had it. So did the guy who ran Workman’s Press inthe ’70s. Carl Weissner had it Germany and if it hadn’t been for him, Bukowskiwould still be working for the post office, even in his grave.But publishers likethat no longer exist. That means the writer is going to have to have the streetsavvy to do it himself but he’s also going to have to find allies. Find hisEdgertons–hustlers, conmen, out-of-work actors and actresses, people with senseand taste and a sense of humor.For example, in 1989,when my poetry book For Women Who Moan came out, I hired two saucy hookers togo into a bar at Happy Hour time. Later, I’d walk in smiling.“You look like you’rein a good mood,” the bartender would say.“Yeah, my book justcame out.”“Oh, what book isthat?”So I show him thebook.“How much?”“No charge. It’s yourtip.”“Thanks, mygirlfriend’s birthday is coming up. I think she’ll like this.”“But maybe you couldshow your new book to those two ladies at the end of the bar?”The two ladies thankhim and start to read–out loud, together, just as we rehearsed it. Already afew guys have meandered in and they hear this strange poem about orgasms justas their sipping their first beer. They knock down that beer tan rapido andorder another. Now the place is starting to fill up. A loud argument starts upat the bar. The ladies are debating which of them has the best Moan–just as werehearsed it.Well, even in 1989,U.S. men had a hard time getting laid. And now, no sooner do they get off workthan they hear two attractive women waxing eloquently on the female orgasm.Potential buyers are creaming their drawers at the sound of it all. Men aresoon packed three-deep around the women. One, then two whisper in the women’sears for their phone number.“Maybe you could buyme a copy of this book,” the men are advised.Of course the guys aregoing to buy the ladies a copy of For Women Who Moan. A half hour later a newcrop of suckers stroll into Happy Hour at Childe Harold’s Bar and Restaurant atDupont Circle in D.C.Happy Hour indeed! Meand the ladies are out of there with ten books sold in an hour and a half. Ileave a ten-dollar tip for the bartender and I meet the ladies down the streetat the corner. I have White Out with me and I spread it through the dedicationsand resell the books at the next bar.Many nights I arrivehome so high I fall asleep in bed with my clothes on. I wake in the morning toten and twenty-dollar bills all over the bed. In eight months I make more moneyfrom a poetry book than even Walt Whitman did in his best years. Poet &Writers, the trade magazine, sends out a reporter. D.C. hookers report thatbusiness has never been better.But if you’re anenterprising author working the streets, you’d better be prepared for accidentsand prepared for how to take advantage of them.Example. One day I’min a supermarket at the checkout line and a huge Black man pushes me aside,yelling, “Make way, make way, I have to cook for the vice president.”I’m so dumb I’m askingmyself, “Which corporation is he talking about?” Then I remember that I do livein Washington, D.C.“Hey!” I yell at thecook, “You rudely pushed me out of the way. Maybe the Vice President would likea copy of my latest book?”He hands me tendollars and I inscribe For Women Who Moan to “Dan Quayle who is ready to leadour noble nation into battle.”Two weeks later I seethe cook in the same supermarket.“Hey, what did the VPthink of my poems?”“He never got them.Mrs. Quayle got a hold of the book and won’t give it up. When I left she was readingit to somebody over the phone.”I could have sold himanother copy but I thought, “The hell with it. Let the VP and his wife fightover the Moan book.”A month later there’sthat cook again.“Hey Cook! Did the VPever get my book?”“Naw, Mrs. Quayle lentit to the First Lady.”Immediately I startedhaving grandiose fantasies. I imagined the President of the United Statesplucking For Women Who Moan off the bedside table and wondering, “Have I everknown a woman who moaned?”Then I imaginedgetting a call from the First Lady and it wasn’t about the quality of my poems.The Moan poem had started her hormones galloping again. I was filled withdread. What if she actually did call and I had to perform on the First Lady orwatch my poetry career go down the drain? It was remote. It was absurd. Butstranger things had happened to me. How would my tool, John Henry, react whenhe saw all that white pubic hair and heard those Secret Service men pacingoutside the door of the motel room???? And what if she did Moan and the SecretService men, thinking she was being strangled, came crashing through the door,guns blazing?? I laughed it off as silly thought; still, every time the phonerang, my stomach tightened. Finally, after a week when I didn’t hear from her Ifigured I was off the hook. Maybe she got George to quit thinking about bombingIraq for an hour and he gave her a tumble. Stranger things had happened.What I wasn’t preparedfor was a knock at the door a few days later. A little guy in a white shirt anda necktie said he was from Baker & Taylor and could he talk with me. Baker& Taylor I knew to be the largest book distributor in the U.S. This repsaid Baker & Taylor had received calls from bookstores requesting the Moanbook and did I have a few hundred copies I could turn over to them. I asked himif anybody important had called the bookstores. Yes, he said. Who? He said hecouldn’t tell me.We did some paperworkthen and it revealed I wouldn’t make much. Bookstores would get 40%, B & T15% which would leave me with one dollar profit on each book. I paid thepublisher $3.50 a book. I told him it was no deal.In retrospect, I madea mistake. I would have had nationwide distribution and it wouldn’t haveaffected my street sales. My ego was just too inflamed with my independence.But what stories I got every week. So, as far as readers now, it’s just amatter of matching the right book to the right locale… and being careful ofelderly ladies who have power.Thank you William for a great interview.Links:The Savage Joy of Guillermo O’JoyceLesEdgerton’s review of ‘First Born of an Ass’ by William JoyceGuillermoO’Joyce’s review of ‘The Rapist’ by Les EdgertonDana Yost’s “Re-blogging:Give this author your attention”William Joyce biographyThis entry was posted in Author Interviews - Quick-Fires and tagged Contemporary Literature.Bookmark thepermalink."},

{"title": "LAST WORD an anthology edited by Liam Sweeny", "date": "Thursday, September 29, 2016", "text": "Hi folks,Gonna share a couple of stories I had last year in my friend Liam Sweeny's anthology titled LAST WORD. Liam asked for a suggestion of a charitable cause to donate the proceeds to and I recommended Nation Inside (www.nationinside.org) a great organization that unites national efforts to pass prison reform measures. Besides yours truly, there are stories from Jack Getze, Paul D. Brazill, David Jaggers, Steve Weddle, Court Merrigan, Todd Robinson, Angel Luis Colon, Tess Makovesky, Christopher Pimental and Gareth Spark, all fantastic noir and crime writers.Consider picking up either a paperback or ebook copy and get both a fantastic read and an opportunity to help effect change in our prison systems.My contribution...MOTHER’S DAYWell, here it is—myannual Mother’s Day post. In reality, this won’t be an “annual” post unless Ido one next year since this is the very first one. I plan to do one next year,though. If I remember...And… I’m aware that it’slate, but I thought that appropriate, since I always forget it until about aweek later, despite a loving wife (Mary) who considers it her mission in lifeto let me know about things like this. The only problem is, she always lets meknow the day before. Like I’m expected to remember it that long!To make up for notsending a card on time, I decided to send Mom more than just one of thosesyrupy Hallmark cards. This year, I sent her a cassette tape of the movie,“It’s a Wonderful Life” starring that irrepressible boyish Jimmy Stewart frommy private collection. (This is the movie where he isn’t dressed up like agiant rabbit, in which he’s also irrepressible and boyish.)Then, the second I gothome from mailing it to her, I realized I’d made a grievous mistake. I hadn’tsent her the movie I thought I had. It dawned on me that I’d sent her anentirely different movie. To be exact, my copy of the classic film noir, CollegeGirls Having Monkey Sex, Part XIV. If you haven’t seen it, it’s the onewhere the coed from Vassar has her boobs pointed in opposite directions and herco-star ends up with whiplash trying to treat them equally and stay on hismark. (“Mark” for you non-theater majors is the piece of tape the directorplaces on the floor to show the actor where to stand.)Oops.The reason I realized myfaux pas, was that when I got home I thought I might want to watch a fewminutes of it and couldn’t locate it and then remembered I’d labeled it… youguessed it… It’s a Wonderful Life… in the unlikely event Mary wentthrough my collection looking for a something to watch.I ran all the way back tothe post office in hopes I could talk the mail guy into letting me have mypackage back, but it seems they have rules against that kind of thing. You canguess how that turned out, if you’ve ever had to deal with the United NaziStates of Mail Carriers. Guy treated me like I was the Unibomber. I called him“Cliff” and “Newman” but he didn’t get it.I was in a sweat when Ifound it had already been shipped, but then I remembered Mom didn’t have acassette player. Or a VCR. Or, even a TV. She’d sold her TV when The EdSullivan Show went off the air a few years ago.The luck of the Irish!Realizing I better dosomething more than send her a tape she couldn’t watch, I asked Mary if we couldtake her out to dinner.“When?” she said. “OnFather’s Day? That’s the next holiday.”I laughed. (That’s it. Ijust laughed) Then, I said, “Of course not, silly. This weekend.”“Only if you don’t usethat name in the restaurant that you always do,” she said.I agreed and called Momto give her the good news. “We’d like to take you out to dinner for your bigday,” I said. “Where would you like to go?” “Would this be an early Mother’s Day for 2011or the late one for 2010?”I laughed. (That’s it. Ijust laughed. I’ve been trained by Mary.) Then I said, “Of course not, silly.The second one. 2010. The battery in my calendar died.”Golden Corral was herfirst choice, but I talked her out of that. “They’re closed,” I lied. “Therewas a big pileup of people on walkers and the health department closed themuntil they widen the ramp. Thirty-six people suffered aluminum whiplash. Thereare herds of lawyers everywhere and you couldn't get in even if it was open.”She sounded skeptical,but then said her second choice was Red Lobster. This, to a guy who’s lived inNew Orleans half his life and has actually eaten real seafood was like the chefat Ruth’s Chris Steak House grabbing a square hamburger down at Wendy’s on hisday off, but hey, it was my mom and it was her day. I looked forward to gazingat their menu with pictures of the nine-pound lobsters on the menu and themseeing the actual three-ounce one they served. To be fair, the actual meal isthe same size as the picture when you put them up next to each other.She decided to drive downfrom where she lived in South Bend to our home in Ft. Wayne, a true adventurefor the other drivers on the highway since she’s 88 and drives older than heractual age. You’ve heard that saying? “(Blank) drives like old people fuck?Slow and jerky.” That’s Mom. If you ever see those long lines on windingcountry roads where there are 117 cars trailing behind the John Deere tractor,it was Mom who taught that tractor driver how to navigate our rural byways. Isuggested she might want to start out the night before to get to our place ontime, but she didn’t think that was all that funny.“You’re not too old toget a spanking, Mr. Smartmouth,” she said. Well, yes, I am, Mom. I have grayhair and arthritis and can remember when phones had dials. Besides, how are yougoing to catch me? I can crawl faster than you can walk. I didn’t say anythinglike that to her, of course. After all, she’s my mom and deserves respect.Besides, as long as I knew I could outrun her that was enough. I didn’t have torub it in.Before she hung up, shesaid, “You’re not going to use that name you always do in restaurants, are you?Because if you do, I’m not coming.”“No, Mom, I’m not. I’mgrown up, now.” Jesus! What do she and Mary do? Get together and compare notes?She gets here, only twoand a half hours past her ETA, and we all climb in the car and head for thegastronomical delights only available at national chains.We get to the Red Lobsterand I’m anticipating something on my plate that looks like a medium jumboshrimp that they’re going to try to pawn off as a Maine lobster and we all goin. This takes awhile as we’re proceeding at Mom’s pace which is about as fastas the last day of school.“We should hurry, Mom,” Isaid. “They close in only six hours.”Mary gives me a dirtylook. So does Mom, who says, “You’re not too big to get a spanking.” I considershowing her my driver’s license to show her my age as she’s obviouslyforgotten, but I don’t. It’s Mother’s Day. Well, not really—that was last week,but we’re operating on the theme of Mother’s Day and I want to remain true tothe spirit.I hustle ahead of themand give our name to the hostess.When I come back, Momsays, “How long?” and Mary says, “You didn’t give them that name, did you?”“Twenty minutes,” I sayto Mom, and to Mary I just give a pained look, as if to say, “How could youeven think I’d do that?”We pass the timelistening to Mom complain about the present government and ask to see a menu soshe can make her choice, which is always the same. The lobster/shrimp combo. Ithink she just wants to check to make sure they haven’t taken either off themenu. Although, if they ran out of one, they could just serve the one that wasleft and tell the diner it was the missing one. Who would know?Then, she lays a bomb onme. “I love that movie, you sent me,” she said. “I’m going over to your sisterAnn’s house to watch it when I get back home.”And then, our table isannounced over the loudspeaker. “Donner, party of three.”I get two dirty looks fromthe women I’m with.“That’s us,” I say.I love Mother’s Day!***BAD NEWSI’m afraid I have some bad news. Let me take that back. Ihave some terrible news. Bad news is when your wife says she’sleaving you for the water softener man. This is far worse than that. This is onthe level of news that she’s leaving you for the guy who lives down by the riverin his refrigerator carton… and not takingthe kids with her…Okay. Ready? Sitting down? Here goes…It’s official. Once again, I didn’t win the Pulitzer Prizefor Literature. How many times must I taste the bitter truth that time isrunning out? Once a year, I guess, until Irun out…And, what beat me out this year? The Orphan Master's Son by Adam Johnson. You’re kidding, right? Here’s the description:An exquisitely crafted novel that carries the reader on anadventuresome journey into the depths of totalitarian North Korea and into themost intimate spaces of the human heart.It’s a book set in NorthKorea? Who the hell nominated this? Dennis Rodman? Who even reads books setin North Korea? Even North Koreans don’t read books set in North Korea. Well,that’s not exactly their fault—they aren’t allowed to by that sweet littlecherub, Dear Leader. Speaking of cherubs, I woke up this morning with a sweetlittle cherub in my skivvies… Or was that a chub? Whatever. They both look thesame.I suspect it won because of the author’s name. He’s namedafter two American presidents. Jingoism at its worst.I should have known I wouldn’t win once again after lastyear when they couldn’t find a single book to give the award to. There wereonly five million books published last year (even taking out the four millionself-published autobiographies that really suck swamp water, that still leavesa million books, give or take a few hundred thousand.).How can you not give one single book the award? Even theyear the Miss America contestants were all dogs, they still gave the award tosomeone. Bert Parks took it himself one year. That was the year there weren’tany brunettes from Mississippi and Georgia. But, hey—they still awarded it tosomebody.I’ve had it. I’m taking serious action. I’ve just composed astrongly-worded letter to all the judges of next year’s Pulitzer committee,notifying them that I’m officially withdrawing any and all of my books fromconsideration. I’m sending it via Overnight Delivery, Certified Mail. Thatmeans it won’t arrive in their mail boxes until August, 2015 but I have nocontrol over that. They’ll at least be aware of my sentiments.And, as it happens, I’m outlining a new novel that fits allof their crappy requirements. It’s set in (some obscure country which I haven’tdecided yet, but one with lots of consonants and only one vowel) and it’s aboutthe Mayor of Cracktown. It’s about this guy who lives in a village with theEntering and Leaving signs on the same pole, and in this little shack with abunch of farm animals of various religious persuasions living inside with him. Hehas no money (always a requirement of these kinds of books and whichimmediately makes him a genius). He has a major fight with the garda who have discovered he’s farexceeded the legal quota of farm animals allowed in a domicile, one of which heclaims shouldn’t count as it’s a very pretty Merino ewe to whom he’s pledgedhis troth. He’s not sure what a “troth” is but it’s in a lot of Dickens’ bookshe read as a kid so he knows it’s important to pledge his.In this book, I devote a lot of pages to his internalizing,which seems to be high on the list of stuff these Pulitzer folks look for.There’s one really dazzling scene where he ponders how clichés came about andfantasizes about their origins. Like that delightful phrase “blind alley”(which, I, for one can never hear too many times.). He ruminates and ponders andrumes some more and comes to the conclusion that it originally denoted a placewhere German shepherds congregated en masse, waiting to be hired by theseeing-challenged (PC term for blind people) and veterans with PTSD. Thisriveting scene takes up 26 pages, which is guaranteed to manipulate them evenmore than a teenaged boy’s chub during bathroom time. And, in much the sameway.One of the indoor farm animals will be a dog. His onlyfunction is to be in the book so I can use his picture on the cover and on theIntergnat. You and I know it’s just a frickin’ mutt, but people on theIntergnat have assigned a mystical aura to dogs and cats. You know, thosecritters that eat their own poop, cough up furballs and lick themselves all daylong. We know that mostly they’re glorified door mats, but people get all weepyabout them and giggly and attribute them with the same wisdom they do oldIndian guys crying over some trash on Highway 10. THEY SELL BOOKS. And influencePulitzer judges…The protagonist will be a creepy loner who, in real life,people would take a wide berth around when they see him with his sign beggingfor work outside Target, but instantly make into a wise man simply becausethere’s a whole book centered around him and we see he thinks about pithy stufflike blind alleys. If he was sofrickin’ wise why ain’t he a plumber’s assistant or a governor or something?My protagonist is also an orphan. And a master. And the sonof a dog. This makes it a sure winner.Yes, I could easily win next year, which makes my protesteven more meaningful. I know what it takes after studying these things for hoursdays weeks. It’s important to know who’s handing out the hardware. Thejudges are elderly folks who braid the hair in their noses (the women) and meetat Golden Corral to discuss the nominated books. The men on the committee treatthe books nominated the same way they do the fine wines they own. They don’topen them. That would destroy their value and besides, who has to actually readthe nominated book? They can learn all they want to from the gloriousIntergnat. The men also have lush bushes in their noses, but they use themdifferently than the women (most of the women…). They weave them cleverlyaround their noggins kind of like the comb-overs aging sportscasters do. Alongwith a few well-placed strands from the ear hairs.This is the real secret as to why my book never getsnominated. I labored for years thinking they actually read the books. Don’tlaugh—I bet you know at least one person in your own circle who thought thesame thing. So maybe you knew, butare you willing to say that all of your friends wear those helmets and rode theshort bus to h.s. and took all A.P. classes? So—cut me a break here.The trick to getting on these judges’ radar is toeffectively utilize the Intergnat. Most of us writers have been sold a bill ofgoods about what the ‘Gnat does. Social media doesn’t sell books. It doesn’tsell squat. It doesn’t sell books—it sells social media. No one cares aboutyour stupid book on social media. They pretend to… so you’ll buy their stupidbook. Writers who can’t sell books have one problem—they write crappy books.Yakking about them all day long on social media sells three books total. That’sit. And that’s to trolls who are burning to write one-star reviews on it. Whensocial media sells books, let me know. Otherwise, lay down by your dish withyour butt-licking dog.But, Pulitzer Prize judges do look at the Intergnat. All daylong. It’s why they don’t have time to actually read the books themselves. Toobusy Facebooking each other or Twittering about “that wonderful book aboutNorth Korea Dennis Rodman likes so well.” Think about this. 1. Dennis Rodmanpicture with Dear Leader was on the “Gnat” one million, three hundred thousandand sixty-nine times last year. 2. A book set in North Korea won the Pulitzer.Make the connection, dummy! This ain’t nuclear physics!So, if I weren’t about to withdraw from consideration,here’s what I’d do. Get me a babe to do my networking for me. As my pretendgirlfriend, Lo Hai Qu so eloquently pointed out—“Blogbitches rule, blogdicksdrool.” Okay. I accept that. If I was going to remain involved in thecompetition, I’d be on my knees beseeching my pal, Anonymous 9 (BlogbitchSupreme) if she’d please help this lowly Blogdick (me) out.But I won’t. You can relax, 9. I’m out of all this. I justhope you nice folks “twit” and “face” my new book all over the Intergnat. Ihave but one goal for next year. That all the UPS drivers who deliver my booksare forced to buy trusses.(I hope you know this was all in fun, folks. Although, if Ihave to say this, it takes all the force away…) I do love the Intergnat and Itruly do love the folks on here. True that. And they do sell books. Books onhow to use the Intergnat to sell books…)As John Goodman once said, “See ya in the funny papers.”Blue skies,Les"},

Hope you enjoy it!                KIDS ON MARRIAGE(This    was sent to me a long time ago by someone and I can’t remember who it was    to give them credit. Sorry! Out of the mouths of babes…)                 HOW DO YOU DECIDE WHO TO      MARRY? (written by kids)             (1) You got to find somebody who likes the same stuff. Like, if you       like sports, she should like it that you like sports, and she should       keep the chips and dip coming. - Alan, age 10             (2) No person really decides before they grow up who they're going to       marry. God decides it all way before, and you get to find out later       who you're stuck with.  - Kristen,      age 10                   WHAT IS THE RIGHT AGE TO GET MARRIED?             (1) Twenty-three is the best age because you know the person      FOREVER by then. - Camille, age 10 (2) No age is good to get      married at. You got to be a fool to get married. – Freddie, age 6 (very      wise for his age)                        HOW CAN A STRANGER TELL IF TWO PEOPLE ARE  MARRIED?

(1) Both don't want any more kids.       - Lori, age 8                   WHAT DO MOST PEOPLE DO ON A DATE?             (1) Dates are for having fun, and people should use them to get to       know each other. Even boys have something to say if you listen long       enough. - Lynnette, age 8  (isn't      she a treasure)             (2) On the first date, they just tell each other lies and that       usually gets them interested enough to go for a second date.  - Martin, age 10  (Who said boys do not have brains)                   WHAT WOULD YOU DO ON A FIRST DATE THAT WAS TURNING SOUR?

(1) When they're rich.- Pam, age 7       (I could not have said it      better myself)             ( 2) The law says you have to be eighteen, so I wouldn't want to mess      with that. - Curt, age 7 (Good Point)             (3 ) The rule goes like this: If you kiss someone, then you should       marry them and have kids with them. It's the right thing to do. -  Howard, age 8  (Who made that rule)                         IS IT BETTER TO BE SINGLE OR MARRIED? It’s better for girls to be      single but not for boys.

{"title": "NO BOUCHERCON, ALAS...", "date": "Thursday, September 1, 2016", "text": "Hifolks,Abit of an update—I won’t be able to attend Bouchercon this year because of a combinationof too much ongoing back pain and too little dough. Really kind of bummed—this ismy spiritual home town and the place I’ve lived the longest except for where Ifind myself now, in Fort Hooterville, IN. I was really looking forward tovisiting old haunts and old friends—especially the Dungeon and the OrientalTriangle. Or Lakeside and Bucktown and the clubs out there, Fat City, Maple Street and otherhangouts. Deannie’s out at the Lakefront. I understand Deannie’s now has a place inthe Quarters—my guess is that they jacked up the prices and cut back on thespices. Not gonna miss the Quarters—hardly ever went there when I lived thereunless I wanted to eat at overpriced, overrated restaurants (with a couple ofexceptions), pay triple prices for watered-down drinks, or hang out withtourists from Iowa, so… hardly ever. Even when I worked in the CBD at theFairmont and rode the streetcar to and from work every day, a half a block awayfrom Bourbon. Much better coffee at any Morning Call over Café du Monde. Mostly,natives avoid the Quarters—there’s much, much better party and eating placesthat cost a lot less and don’t attract the tourists. Better music venues thanthe Quarters also… The Takee-Outees have hugely ruined it...Hintto visitors—the real party animals come out at two o’clock after theout-of-towners have gone back to their hotels to sleep…Mighttry to make Thrillerfest this year instead. Or even Killer Nashville.Ihope I get back to the Big Sleazy one of these days. My preference would be togo down for Jazz Fest. Like most natives, I stay away from town during MardiGras. That’s really a deal for the tourists. I do enjoy Mardi Gras down atGrand Isle—it’s much, much gooder.TheQuarters seem like a cool deal when all you’ve seen is cornfields… But, thereare other parts of N’Awlins that are so, so much better.Formy friends who do go down—laizzez les bon temps rouler! Go for the lagniappe!And, be sure to walk in the center of the streets and don’t wander past theboundaries. There are projects that await, eagerly…Thatsounds like I don’t like New Orleans, doesn’t it? Not the case—just hate theoverly-commercial cartoon they’ve made the Quarters into. The rest of itabsolutely rocks.Blueskies,LesP.S. Just made a deal with Eric Campbell, the publisher of Down&Out Books for a couple of new books which will be released next year. And, this fall my very first novel, The Death Of Tarpons, is coming out with a new title (don't know what it is yet) as an ebook from Endeavour Books in the U.K. and in paperback from Betimes Books (UK). Tarpons previously only existed in hardcover from the University of North Texas Press and we got the rights back because it had sold out."},

{"title": "GUILLEMO O'JOYCE'S REVIEW OF THE RAPIST", "date": "Saturday, July 30, 2016", "text": "Hifolks,Today,I want to share with you what I consider the finest review of my work everwritten, Guillermo O’Joyce’s view of my existential novel, The Rapist.Whatmakes it what I feel is a brilliant take on my work are two things. First, andforemost, O’Joyce has captured exactly what I intended with this book. I’vebeen graced with some wonderful reviews from others and I appreciate them all,but this writer has dug deeper into what I was trying to do more than anyother.Second,what makes this a landmark moment in my writing life, is the reputation of thereviewer. Guillermo O’Joyce is one of the finest writers ever produced in thepast century. Although sorely neglected by the literary establishment, O’Joyceis truly a living literary legend.Spacedoes not allow me to list all of his accomplishments. Just a few include thefact that he has taught with James Dickey, Kurt Vonnegut, John Irving, SaulBellow, and a list of dozens of the best writers of our lifetimes. He haswritten a book, that, in my opinion, is the best book I’ve ever read, theprofanely genius novel, First Born of anAss, which was championed and blurbed by Norman Mailer. O’Joyce stands atthe very top of the pantheon of great Western writers of all times.He’salso brutally blunt in his assessment of the state of American letters and it is that forthrightness that has cost him favor with the literary establishment.This is their shame, not his. Read his work and then the work of his criticsand it becomes clear that his is a classic case of a host of inferior talentacting out of jealousy toward a writer so far ahead of their second-rateabilities, that it should be embarrassing to them, but, like all those who arepossessed of mediocrity, they fail to recognize themselves.Myhope is that someone with cojones among the literary establishment will readhis words below and exhibit the kind of bravery that is lacking in many who arein charge of publishing these days and publish this review in a worthy vehicle.He deserves much more recognition than has been afforded him.I’verecommended him to my agent, Svetlana Pironko, and one of my publishers, FrankNowatzki of the German press, Pulpmaster, and both are currently reading hisnewest work, a Cuban memoir.Currently,O’Joyce is living in St. Augustine, Florida in near-penury, and is surviving byplaying his harmonica in front of restaurants for coins. This isshameful—shameful to the literary establishment who allow one of our greatestwriters to subsist this way, when he should be lauded at every turn. Truegenius always brings out the vitriol of the lesser. All I can say to those whocontrol publishing is that I can only hope some among that bunch recognize thebona fide brilliant talent who lives among us and who possess a vision greaterthan most. The word “genius” is bandied about far too often and given to manywho are undeserving of the title. Guillermo O’Joyce is more deserving than anywriter I know of. And, those whose vision is more acute than others are all toooften denigrated by those of lesser abilties because of their own sense offailure. Especially toward those who point out their deficiencies. As Einsteinonce noted, “Adventurous spirits always encounter the violent opposition ofmediocre minds.”Ionly hope there is someone out there who reads this and recognizes what it isthey are reading. And does something to help this literary giant before it’stoo late.Me and Joe LansdaleI was recently interviewed by Pam Stack on her podcast, \"Authors on the Air,\" and Pam asked me something to the effect of what was my biggest award as an author. My answer is this: More than sales, more than awards, more than anything, my biggest awards have always been the respect of the writers I respect. In the past several months, I've received what I consider my two biggest honors--first, the words from Joe Lansdale when he said: \"Les Edgerton has swiftly become my favorite crime writer. Original voice, uncompromising attitude and a pure hardboiled syle leap him to the front ranks of my reading list. He will become legendary.\" The second and equal to Joe's words, is O'Joyce's review of my best work, which follow.Igive you, Guillermo O’Joyce…Review of TheRapistAuthor: Les EdgertonReviewer: Guillermo O’JoyceJuly 1st, 2016            Henry Miller once wrote, “If any mandared translate all that is in his heart, to put down what is really hisexperience, what is truly his truth, I think then the world would to go smash,no accident, no will could ever again assemble the pieces, the atoms, theindestructible elements that have gone to make up the world.”            Such a man has emerged. His name isLes Edgerton. The vehicle for his assault is a fictional character named TrumanPinter, the book has the title TheRapist. The reverberations of his words are so violent and encompassing,the reader becomes as taut and nerve-wracked as the teller of the story after10 pages.            That is because the reader isdirectly incriminated as the villain. The reader is left no room to stand. Heis cornered with the falsification of his own life. Like Truman, a condemnedman awaiting execution for the supposed crimes of rape and murder, the readeris condemned and pinned against the cell bars of unflinching prose. The chargesare reversed: by the end of 140 pages the reader is pronounced Guilty ofCapitulation.            Let Truman speak: “He (Defiler ofTruth) lacks a center—each of you is his center—and he has sucked the marrowdry of each of those he has visited.”            These are the words Truman has heldback for 44 years. Now that he is condemned, he is free to fire away.Edgerton’s hope is that a few humans who are not legally condemned but feeltrapped by his words will begin to speak from their conscience. Right now theworld is devoid of conscience and consciousness. The timing for such a book isperfect.            Truman’s real crime is that he hasremained separate. He has inherited money and doesn’t have to work. Until hemeets the town trollop, he is a virgin. It is this separateness that gets himlabeled and condemned to die. Humans have a great fear of The Loner, TheOutsider. They fear he may know something they don’t. Therefore, they must killhim. Richard Wright’s Native Son wasoriginally entitled The Outsider. Native Sonis one of the few books that can match TheRapist for sustained tension. But just as Wright’s voice is labeled “BlackProtest”, The Rapist is under lockand key as a “crime novel”. You can’t sell anything on this Earth unless it is grouped under a fashionable label. Andwe wonder why there is murder all around us????            There is no self-righteousness toTruman Pinter. Just before his execution he realizes that this detachment whichhe thinks gives him freedom, has paradoxically made him a slave. He says,“Those who cared did something about the situation they disliked. I had simplylet things happen and taken the consequences, good or bad. Therefore, Irelinquished control and in doing so gave up any claim to freedom.” He is asunsparing with his own life as he is with the props of western civilization.            Yet, Truman is not to be dismissedas a misguided rebel. A prison guard says about him, “I think that you’re somekind of genius that doesn’t belong anywhere.” About this pronouncement, Trumanremarks, “In his straightforward way, he had cut through the subterfuge andclaptrap and identified the truth.”            Now the word “genius” is as overusedas the phrase “cutting edge.” The dictionary says, “one who is exceptionallyintelligent or creative,” a sure sign the experts of language are just as lostas prison wardens. When it comes to people who combine great talent, faith intheir intuition, discipline, and courage to chart their own direction, thearbiters of culture have no idea what to do with them. They don’t fit anyprevious pattern; their works resist labeling; their lives seem a mess; theyare difficult to deal with. They are simply on another wave length.            This is true of Edgerton and hiscreation, Truman. Yet, Truman spirals off and becomes much more than amouthpiece; he becomes an independent voice, one that will haunt the sleep ofreaders with the guts to hear him out.            In designing Truman, Edgerton hadthe wisdom to make him completely unattractive. He fits none of the formulasfor an engaging human being. His personality has no color. He doesn’t play thefiddle nor show any interest in being an artist. He espouses no causes,political nor religious. He is pompous, conceited, and a bit of a boor in thefirst 12 pages. Until he is sentenced, he is without conviction.            However, Truman is not a completeblank. He was nursed in a rocking chair until he was 6. His father left when hewas 5. He does have a degree from Princeton, a fact which only gets him introuble with the warden, also a Princeton graduate. The warden cannot fathom acondemned man who hasn’t been underprivileged. Until the run-in with the towntrollop, he’s done little but fish, observe, and read. Yet, books have meantlittle to him. Oh, he’s done one other thing, he’s masturbated. Often. He’sdribbled away the constant tension he feels between himself and the rest of therace.            What Truman can do is see and hearclearly and then express himself from his conscience. In a marvelous bit ofdiscipline on Edgerton’s part, he doesn’t allow Truman to indulge in anyrhetoric of castigation. Truman simply addresses his situation, as it arises,in brief one and two paragraph responses and it is all like a hidden song fromthe core of the earth. It is a reminder of Edgerton’s one relative, ArthurRimbaud, who wrote in 1872, “I turned silences and nights into words. What wasunutterable I wrote down. I made the whirling world stand still.”            As an example of the reverberationsof Truman I will cite one: beans. Beans are fed to prisoners because they arethe cheapest of all foodstuffs. Says Truman, “The warden has an allowance forour food and if he can save money from his allotted budget, he’s allowed tokeep the savings for himself.” To add to the fun, merchants put gravel in thebeans to up the weight and collect more money. Truman bites down on a bean andbusts a molar. His entire story is told with a toothache.            Parochial enough, you say. Yet isthere a single product we can buy that hasn’t been tampered with? That hasn’tbeen shot full of hormones, laced with pesticides, left to the vagaries of somecantankerous machine, the negligence of some bitter foreman? Defects on newcars kill almost as many people as the Diaper Heads do yet not a single CEO hasever been put on trial. Still, no student is allowed in a college classroomwithout his assurance that he will be a good consumer.            This then is a book of revolt.            The need to revolt is implicit inevery line.            That’s what gives The Rapist its superhuman tension.            If books could be measured by whatthey provoke, this book of Edgerton’swould top the list. It’s going to enrage people because they’re going torealize the hypocrisy by which they gained their food and shelter was nothingmore than honoring a host of killing machines which absolutely denied theexistence of the spirit of creation.            Now we are back to the Son of Molochwhich begins The Rapist—“He lies downwith all members of the congregation equally.” Most adults will try to blockout its message; they’re not going to relinquish 30 or 40 years of gaining aprecarious foothold within a teetering civilization. Better to be a zombie withsomething to eat than a gaping worm behind a bush, pleading for a bowl ofbeans.            But there’s one group that’s goingto take The Rapist to heart preciselybecause they haven’t been indoctrinated by the realities. That’s 15-year-oldsacross the U.S., Europe, and Japan. They’ve experienced enough of the killingmachines to doubt their legitimacy. They quite rightly suspect that they’resoon going to end up in a uniform, holding a rifle, and dropped on theirpubescent heads from an airplane into a country whose name they can’tpronounce. They are largely male and owing to another war that goes untalkedabout, they can’t get laid. They’re going to glance at Truman’s persistentwhacking away and declare, “Not me!”            Then watch out! All that pubescentenergy backed up, searching for an object for their wrath. That they will findtheir way to The Rapist isproblematic unless some bitter but adventurous philanthropist buys up copiesand passes them out on the street advancing on a schoolyard.            Unlikely, you say. Hah! No moreunlikely than the miracle of The Rapistwhose knife-edge I lay in your hands now.--Guillermo O’Joyce, Author, Don’tDo It Standing Up, Recorder of Births and Deaths: Stories, First Born of anAss, For Women who Moan, Listen, America, You Don’t Even Own Your Name, andMiller, Bukowski and Their Enemies,among others. Thankyou for reading O’Joyce’s review. I hope it affected you and showed you what a trulygreat writer is capable of on the page.Blueskies,Les"},

Had some medical problems over the past several weeks--had my gallbladder sucked out through my navel and some major back problems. The gallbladder thing was a piece of cake--no pain before, during or after the surgery--but the back pain has laid me low! Could only be up for about an hour before it got to be too much and then had to lie down for an hour. Really drained my energy! Also had a throat infection and some other crap going on during that time.Fortunately, I was finally able to get my third spinal steroid shot a few days ago and this time it worked. Still have some pain but nothing like I was having before. It was really hard to focus on anything during that time which is the main reason I haven't been posting.So, some news! Tonight, I'm being interviewed by Pam Stack on her Authors on the Air podcast at 9 pm ED. Hope you can tune in! You can also phone in and say hi if you like.

{"title": "THE BEST BOOK I'VE EVER READ", "date": "Tuesday, May 24, 2016", "text": "Hi folks,This is the best book I've ever read.REVIEWFIRST BORN OF AN ASSWilliam JoyceI’ve never written a review like this and am unlikely to ever do so again. The reason is I’ve never been totally thunderstruck by a book such as William Joyce’s First Born of an Ass. In lieu of a review, in which I am unable to do its genius even close to suitable justice, I’m going to use the email I sent to William Joyce, upon reading its last page. I cannot say what this book did to me better.Mr. William Joyce, I just finished FIRST BORN OF AN ASS. I am utterly unworthy to write a review, but I shall try. This is the book God would have written if He could write.Your book has leaped over all books I've read in my lifetime. I cannot talk about it now. I don't know if I'll ever be able to talk about it.I am going to go to bed and try to figure out who I am. To be honest, I am shattered. I don't think I'll ever be able to write again and that is the truth. One thing I do know; when I am able I am going to do everything in my power to get this book reissued. This is far, far beyond Nobel Prize worthy.Thank you for the gift of your genius.Respectfully,Les EdgertonThat is the email I sent him. I realize this opinion is firmly attached to whatever small literary reputation I may have and that may be considered risky and even foolhardy. But, I fully stand by it. I will not compromise what I feel about this book in the least, reputation and all that be damned. If you can point out a better book, I’ll read it. And, if there is a better book out there, then we all might as well give up.The only action people should take is to get this book reissued or republished. Please read it.--Les Edgerton, Author, The Rapist, The Bitch, Monday’s Meal and others.End of reviewP.S. William Joyce is still alive and living in St. Augustine, FL. He embodies the very concept of \"writer.\" He is virtually destitute and has been making his living by playing his harmonica outside of restaurants for coins until the police made him cease. The only place you can buy most of his books are from used copies via abebooks and the like... of which he doesn't realize a cent. He has a new novel written, but it's in a storage locker in Miami and he's trying to get enough money to get down there and retrieve it and send it to an agent and publisher. If anyone is in a position to help him out, please let me know. In my opinion, he's a national treasure. He does have one book available as an ebook, a collection of essays, under one of his pen names, Guillermo O'Joyce, titled MILLER, BUKOWSKI & THEIR ENEMIES. He does realize royalties from this one, so please consider glomming onto a copy. Thank you."},
{"title": "AUDITORS FOR MY ONLINE WRITING CLASS", "date": "Wednesday, May 11, 2016", "text": "Hi folks,I'm about to climb on a plane tomorrow to head to Austin and San Antonio (they're in Texas, case you weren't aware) for eight days of the marvelous Writer's Retreat Workshop (WRW) at the Oblate Retreat Center in San Antone.Just read a FB post by Craig McNeely, who audited my online writing class last session, who wrote in it:I've been working on a novel for the past three-four years. Sometimes the work has been heavier than others but still, the fact remains that the book hasn't truly \"worked\" in this time.Then, this year, I audited a workshop from Les Edgerton. Learned a few basic but crucial things about storytelling and discovered ways in which I've been too precious about my own work, unwilling to really consider what does or doesn't work, the way I would with a client or an old DLP author.Now, for instance, I know that this novel really begins on page 34. Got a long way to go to the finish line but it's better now than it ever was before.So what I'm saying is: you ever get a chance to do this thing with Les in the future, you take it. I promise you'll get something out of it. Maybe not the same as what I got, but there is much insight to be had.Craig McNeelyAnd, that reminded me I hadn't sent out a call for auditors for the current session. We had just begun Week 1 of our 10-week session when I had to suspend class for two weeks for my Texas trip. Which means if anyone's interested in auditing this session, we can get you in and you won't miss any of it. We'll pick up with Week 2 after I return on May 22. The fee is $50 for auditing, as opposed to $400 for active participation. We are rarely able to take on new class members as people keep taking it and the ones already in it always have first shot. This last time was a bit unusual as we had two openings from folks who'd finished their novel and are taking a bit of a hiatus while they sell their books. When we do take on new members, we always go to our auditors for the first chance.If you're interested and would like more info, just shoot me an email at butchedgerton@comcast.net. You won't even miss what we did on Week 1 as it's all archived. You'll see everything we do in class and the only difference between an auditor and an active class member is that, just like in a college class, auditors sit in class but just don't participate. But, they see everything we're doing and just about everyone who's audited has told me it was a remarkably profitable experience for their writing.So... there ya go. Hope if any of you are in or near Austin tomorrow night, you'll stop in for the Noir @ the Bar reading I'm doing with three other terrific writers at Threadgill's Bar at 7 pm. It's gonna be fun!Blue skies,Les"},

There, a smallgroup of pre-published novelists and writers of narrative non-fiction gatheredfor the first Writers Retreat Workshop.Their purpose: to study with one of the leading teachers of writing forpublication- Gary Provost, known to themas “The Writer's Writer.” And the purpose of the WRW: to teach these studentsall that Gary knew about the art, craft, and business of being anovelist.\"Until his untimelydeath in 1995 at the age of fifty, Gary Provost was arguably the leadingteacher of writing in the United States.”—Writer's Digest Books\"When I planned our first WRW, I had an ideal vision of how the worksessions would go, but because we were doing this for the first time, naturallyI worried. As it turned out, things went better than I had even hoped. The worksessions were lively, thoughtful, and constructive. The writers who came wereall the serious-minded, dedicated people we had tried to reach. Though weenjoyed fun and good conversation each day, nobody forgot why we were there: tobring our books closer to publication. For me, it was exciting to see writersabandoning poor writing habits and breaking through to new levels of ability.WRW was the most satisfying teaching experience of my career, and I believethat for the writers it was the most successful learning experience. Perhapsthe best measure of last year's success is the fact that all of our writerscontinued to work on their books... and are in touch with each otherstill.\"--GaryProvostFor these serious writers, Gary simplified the complex with his unique blend ofwarmth, wit, and wisdom; creating an easy-to-absorb, step-by-step course thathas become the hallmark of WRW instruction. He was a master communicator, andof his more than 24 published books covering most genres, seven were writtenspecifically for writers. Included in that list are such top sellers asWriter’s Digest Books’ Make Every Word Count, Beyond Style: Mastering the FinerPoints of Writing, Make Your Words Work, and the more recent How To Tell AStory: The Secrets of Writing Captivating Tales.Because Gary Provost was an inspiration to writers around the globe, his suddendeath in 1995 left the writing world shaken. At WRW, however, his indomitablespirit endures as his legacy lives on. Founded by Gary and Gail Provost toprovide writing students with as much current nuts and bolts information aspossible in the short amount of time, WRW continues to offer an abundance ofadvice, tips, and guidance; ensure a nurturing supportive environment free of“real life” distractions; and include a hearty dose of fun.So, who are these WRW participants who feel compelled to attend these cherishedopportunities to learn and grow as writers? They are dedicated students,committed to learning to improve their craft in order to publish their novels.Although they arrive at varying levels of ability and experience, all makedramatic leaps and leave WRW as far more confident writers. Without exception.Oblate Retreat and Conference in the heart of San Antonio is the home of WRW.Your eight days of intensive learning, writing, workshops, ample 1-1 meetingswith industry professionals, and making life-long memories will be held againstthe backdrop of a gorgeous Texas retreat center.Co-founded in 1987 by the late Gary Provost (author and internationally acclaimedteacher of writing for publication) and his wife Gail, WRITERS RETREAT WORKSHOPis an intensive learning experience for small groups of serious-minded writerswho are committed to improving and completing their novels for submission.

You will be made to feel at home so that nothingstands in the way of your success during the eight days.This is a workshop, andyou will work.You'll attend class each morning and be taught WRW's in-depth, step-by-stepcourse for crafting your novel, of any genre, for publication. This is notformulaic novel instruction. There is no such formula. Gary broke down novelstructure scene-by-scene, dissected characters, taught how to choose words withimpact, and shared many other fine details novelists must learn as secondnature. Here, at WRW, we review these stylistic tools over and over throughoutthe week until you leave feeling equipped, inspired, and revitalized about yournovel. We don't teach the art-- we teach the craft and instruct you on how tonurture the artist. Class instruction uses examples from classic to bestsellersof that day. Prior to the workshop you will be given a list of books used and aseries of pre-workshop assignments. During the workshop you will be givenassignments, then go back to your private room or one of the various outdoorspots to write. All work focuses on your novel, so while you work on yourstory's structure, our dedicated staff will be available to brainstorm with youon your plot. In small group sessions, while learning how to diagnose your ownand others' style strengths and weaknesses, you'll also boost your editingskills.Other optional activities include 7am Early Bird sessions, evening wine andappetizer Shop Talks (featuring agents, instructors, students, and authors),Book Signing night, 10pm Night Owl Sessions, and ample 1-1 opportunities withcore and visiting staff. WRW is as close to an eight-day, 20+ hour workshop asyou can get. It's unparalleled in what it offers. And most of all, if you wantonly a nice writing retreat in which you work on your book and socialize whenneeded-- it's that as well. The only request of new participants is that youattend the morning sessions based on Gary Provost's groundbreaking course-- andyou'll want to anyway. WRW is immersion in the writing world whether you'rewriting genre, literary fiction, children's literature, memoirs, short stories,or any number of creative writing endeavors. That's why top agents and authorsreturn year after year.Assisting you throughout the eight days will be WRW mentors and In-Residenceguests, including authors/agents/editors who will share with you the truthabout today's publishing \"business\" and --when they meet with you --how best to market your novel-in-progress.Where and when is the nextWriters Retreat Workshop?WRW 2016  May 12 -19Oblate Retreat and Conference CenterSan Antonio, TXRides from the San Antonio airport (very near the the retreat center) will beavailable.Do I belong at theWriters Retreat Workshop?The decision to attend the WRW should, of course, be a considered one.

Expect that your dreams will berevitalized.Here are some commentsfrom some of our recent Writers Retreat Workshop participants.\"WRW is a unique blend of writing craft education, and thedevelopment/enrichment of the spiritual side of writing. Until this retreat, I neverrealized one suffered without the other. Since WRW, I’ve found a deepercreativity, and a confidence I never had before.  I’ve carried some of thespiritual practices into my daily writing routine and have become a richerwriter as a result.\" - Joni, TX (2015)\"If you are a writer, and you want to be a published author, you need thebest instruction, feedback, and information necessary to accomplish that goal.WRW is the place to get all three from well-placed and well-respected industryexperts in a nurturing environment with members of your own tribe—the nation ofwriters.\" – Rick, NC (2015 and previous)\"I learned more about craft- about the elements of story structure andscene development in ten days than I have from years of reading writer's booksand attending conferences.

{"title": "GET READY FOR A RIDE ON THE WILD SIDE!", "date": "Tuesday, March 8, 2016", "text": "Hi folks,Have I got a humdinger of a book to recommend to you!Review—Anthony Neil Smith’s HOLY DEATHGotta front this with a bit of a disclaimer. AnthonyNeil “Doc” Smith is a good, good friend as evidenced by the dedication of thisbook… to moi! This is without a doubt one of the biggest and most cherishedhonors I’ve ever received as a writer. Neil is one of my biggest heroes and inmy opinion, one of the best writers churning out stuff today. All that said,all I can say is this book is one helluva wild ride.Most of us writers take from our own lives tofurnish the populations of our books. Billy Lafitte in HOLY DEATH is one of thebest examples of such. Neil Smith suffered a major heart attack and nearly diedbefore he recovered to write this book and then he did what any writer worthhis salt almost always does—turned a truly horrifying and dark personal experienceinto the gold of literature. It’s what we do, and Neil does it perhaps betterthan anyone I know. Billy Lafitte is the baddest ass of all time, just as NeilSmith is one of the baddest ass writers I know. There are great characters inthrillers and noir, and while I greatly enjoy following the exploits of a guylike Jack Reacher, I frickin’ LOVE following the adventures of Billy. That’sbecause the situations he gets himself into more closely resemble the placesand are peopled more by the people I know and have interacted with. In otherwords, Billy is a totally real guy. Just badder than most real guys. He doesn’tposture, he doesn’t come up with tricky karate moves, he doesn’t leap from tallbuilding to tall building; he just kicks major ass while in the middle of anongoing major heart attack. He’s like a fricking cockroach—you can’t kill theguy. He reminds me so much of guys I used to run with and who I was in thejoint with. Just no quit in ‘em. It’s the nature of us hillbillies—they justdon’t quit when they’re in a fight.I couldn’t turn the pages fast enough. There’s not asingle page that you’re not racing to read to get to the next. It gets darkquickly, and then darker, and then even darker, and just when you think itcouldn’t get an iota bleaker… the lights all go out and that’s when the realblackness kicks in. I’ll use this novel to show my students how to createtension.And, how to write real-life sex scenes. Likeeverything else in this novel the sex itself is down and dirty and the way itgoes down in the mean streets. Nothing like it that I know of in most of thebooks I read. I’m pretty sure Georgette Heyer didn’t have folks like thisbetween her covers. Love is in here as well—love of the sort that real peopleexperience. The love of a man for a woman who will grant her the grace of deathout of that love.Not to give away spoilers, but my biggest fear wasthat Billy was going to end up dead. That he doesn’t and that there’s yetanother novel coming with him is the best news of all.Neil was at his absolute lowest point when we talkedand he tells me I convinced him to keep going with this series. I’m so damnedglad he did. This is a masterpiece. Get it and read it—I guarantee you I wouldn’tsteer you wrong on this.Then, when you finish this one, you’ll find yourselfback at the bookstore or on Amazon, about to buy all of the Billy Lafittenovels. I’ll lay odds on that.Blue skies,Les"},
{"title": "EXCERPT FROM MY MEMOIR...", "date": "Friday, February 26, 2016", "text": "Hi folks,I've been editing my memoir preparatory to my agent sending it out and intended to do some cutting, but instead added a bit to it. I've left a lot out but this bit was interesting I thought, so am including it. It's near the end of the saga, right after Mary and I got married and we moved back to New Orleans.Hope you get a kick out of it.            We moved to New Orleans shortlyafter we got married. We found a duplex apartment on Burthe near the CameliaGrill and Mary got a job at David DeLong’s salon a block away and I got a jobat Busta’s at the Fairmont (Hotel) down in the CBD. I got to ride the streetcarto and from work each day and it was wonderful.            We had a weird experience the firstweekend we were in town. Just about broke, we decided to drive down to GrandIsle on the Gulf which I was familiar with—my Uncle Buddy before he passed awayhad a vacation home there and we used to visit all the time. Our plan was to dosome crabbing and enjoy the sun and surf. It was a holiday weekend, Labor Day.            A block away from our apartment, Idiscovered I’d left my billfold at home. We were already running late, so Idecided not to turn back. That turned out to be a big mistake.            On the way down is a town calledGolden Meadow. There was a famous bakery there that I wanted to show Mary. WhenI was a kid, we used to visit it and they were famous all over the world—evenshipping their goods to Paris. Golden Meadow also had another claim to fame.They were the site of a well-known speed trap. Since the oil bust a few yearsback, the town had fallen upon hard times and to make money the police departmenthad set up a speed trap for unsuspecting tourists that had been publicized inNew Orleans. A reporter had gone undercover and exposed the scam and we’d justseen the TV report. Just before the bakery, the speed limit was 35 mph which Iwas careful to observe, remembering the report. We went in. Mary was impressedand we bought some rolls and other things and then came out to our car.            We jumped in and again, I wasmindful of the speed limit. What I didn’t notice was a new speed limit sign just on the edge of the bakery property. Thatone lowered the limit to twenty mph. A block away down the road, there was anold clunker parked by the side of the road and an old guy in front of it on theroad, waving his arms. Figuring he had car trouble, I pulled over to give him ahand.            As soon as I approached him, hepulled out a gun from behind his back and stated he was a cop and had me liedown on the road where he cuffed me. For speeding. Out of nowhere, another car,this time a clearly-marked patrol car, appeared. I was put in the back seat andthe uniformed cop told Mary to follow us to the police station.            Some shit, huh?            When we got there, the police chiefwho turned out to be the old guy I’d stopped to help, told Mary my fine wouldbe a hundred dollars for both the speeding ticket and the fact that I didn’thave a driver’s license on me and that I wouldn’t be released until it waspaid. We didn’t have a credit card and didn’t have enough money on us to paythe fine. We had a book of checks but they were from a Ft.Wayne bank and wehadn’t yet had time to open a New Orleans’ account and he wouldn’t take anout-of-state check. He said Mary would have to find someone to cash a check.            Mary’s face was absolutely white.She had no idea where we were and her sense of direction was… how do I saythis?... flawed, so I wasn’t sure she could even find her way back if she wentvery far. I think she was thinking the same thing.            She left and I’m sitting there on achair as the chief began taking info from me. When he got his paperwork done,he told me to stand up and follow him back to the cells. Another cop came outfrom some room and asked the guy if he was going to shake me down.            “Nah,” the guy said. “I don’t thinkhe’s got a hand grenade on him, do you?” If I had, it would have been hard tohide. I was wearing a t-shirt and a pair of cutoffs and flip-flops. He turnedto me and said, “You don’t have a hand grenade on you, do you?” He waslaughing.            “Not this time,” I said. I wasn’t smiling.            Neither was he. The guy came ungluedand walked over and got me in a hold and the other cop came over and shook medown. “That isn’t funny,” the chief said. “Last week we arrested a guy and he did have a hand grenade on him.”            They took me back to a holding celland I sat there for three hours. Mary finally returned just when I’d aboutgiven up hope of ever seeing her again. She had the money and paid my fine andwe left. Just turned around and went back home.            On the way she told me why it tookso long. She’d had to drive around to a bunch of little towns around GoldenMeadow to try and find a place to cash a check. Most places were closed becauseof the holiday and the few she found wouldn’t cash a check from Indiana.Finally, when she’d just about given up, she said a manager at a supermarkethad taken pity on her and cashed one for her. She might have been crying atthat point, though she never admitted to that.            A week later, we had another“adventure.” I snagged a job at Busta’s after going through a couple ofinterviews with him and submitting my resume. It was a great salon in a greathotel. The salon was just across the hall from the famous Sazerac bar and justdown the block-long hall from the famous Blue Room. The rumor at the time wasthat Frank Sinatra kept a suite there with a year-long lease for $10,000 anight and rarely visited it.            There was a front—page news storygoing on at the time about a murder trial involving furniture magnate AaronMintz who had discovered his dead wife one morning along with his mistress. Itseemed clear it wasn’t the suicide Mintz claimed since she was found with thegun in her hand… what made suicide clearly not the cause of her death was thatthe gun was found in her right hand and she was left-handed… and she’d shotthrough a pillow Mintz’s legal team claimed she’d placed over her own headbefore pulling the trigger. I guess out of consideration that she wouldn’t wakeanyone…            Well, after I set up my tools andmet some of the staff, a gorgeous young woman with long blonde hair swept intothe salon, tossed the receptionist her fur coat and sat down in my chair.            “Hi, Les,” she said.            It turned out she was my firstclient.            I wondered how she knew my name andthat got cleared up quickly. She was Ruth-Ann Munitis, the aforementioned AaronMintz’s mistress. Ruth-Ann was also reputed to have been Dutch Morial’smistress before hooking up with Mintz.            She started talking to me like Iknew all of these things—which I didn’t and only learned later. She told me shewas taking over the salon from Busta and had read my resume and was going toneed a salon manager and thought I had the kind of qualifications she would belooking for.            In a daze, I excused myself from herand went to the back room where Busta was and told him what she was saying. Heclued me in with the short version. That she’d bailed him out a few months agowhen he was heavily into debt for cocaine and gambling debts and had become hisfinancial partner. Then, things started going south, he said. She began takingover more and more of the salon and the last straw was when she told him shewanted all the stylists to start wearing tuxedos when we worked. At that point,he tried to pull out of the partnership, but she wasn’t standing for that andhad her lawyers trying to take over and he had his lawyers fighting all that.Each night after the salon closed, he would take the appointment book and allthe client records home with him so she couldn’t steal those and lock him out.            It was just a total clusterfuck. Andhere I was, first day on the job, and right smack in the middle of it. Headvised me to keep on her good side as she might win and I’d need a job.            I didn’t know what to do. It endedup, I went back to her and told her I needed time to get up to speed oneverything so if she’d be so kind I’d appreciate it if she had someone else cuther hair.            That night, I told Mary all that wasgoing on and she was in a daze. New Orleans was turning out to be verydifferent from Ft.Wayne!            The upshot was, I kept on workingfor Busta for another few weeks and Ruth-Ann would waylay me when I left forthe day and I kept putting her off for a decision. The decision wasn ‘t hard—Imean this was the mistress of a mob-connected guy and it looked obvious she’dtaken part in the murder of her boyfriend’s wife. I could get a glimpse of myfuture with her and it didn’t look rosy.            Finally, I had to quit. I hated tosince I really liked Busta and the salon, but then Mintz got acquitted and RuthAnn got even bolder and it was time to boogie on down the road. Turns out Mintzwas mob-connected also, as a few years later he got convicted in a mob schemeto steal from the Las Vegas gambling company Bally’s.            From there, I got a job at theUptown Square salon and that had another twist to it. Then-governor EdwardEdwards used to come to New Orleans periodically, and bring his wife. When hecame, he’d rent two adjoining suites in a good hotel and he and his wife wouldbunk in one of them with the other suite reserved for one of his manymistresses. All of that was quite open. In fact, they did a local documentaryon Edward’s philandering and interviewed his wife who was blunt about it. Yes,she said, she was very aware that he kept mistresses and she was friends withalmost all of them. It’s just the “Louisiana way” she said and it was.            Well, I got involved with all thatinadvertently. It turns out one of Edwards’ favorite girlfriends was a fellowstylist at Uptown Square. Whenever he and his wife came to town, she was one ofthe ones he’d call. When that happened, she’d just take the weekend off andthe clients on her book would go to the junior stylist. Who was moi. Inaddition to my own clients, I had to take care of hers as well. I was humpingmy ass off to take care of a double load. Thanks, Guv…            Stuff like that kept happening andI’m pretty sure Mary was kind of freaked out at the kind of town New Orleanswas proving to be. I loved it, but I was an adrenaline junkie. That didn’tdescribe Mary so much…I love New Orleans and miss the excitement that was always ongoing!Hope you enjoy this small excerpt and will want to buy the whole enchilada when it comes out. Right now, the working title is RENTING SPACE IN MY HEAD, but that could change...Blue skies,Les"},

Hope you enjoy it.OklahomaWriters Federation Inc. Keynote address--2015TheBuilding Blocks of StoryHi! My name is Les andI’m an alco—oops! Wrong meeting! My name is Les Edgerton and I’m a writer. I’mreally happy to be here and to impart to all of you all of the secrets you’llever need to becoming a bestselling author, one whose books all get made intomovies, where you’re asked to do cameos in the blockbuster flicks they make ofyour work, and literally roll around in filthy lucre. Your books will all getrave reviews in the NY Times. You’ll dine always at Spago’s and Elaine’s andnever again dream of going through the drive-thru at MacDonald’s. You’ll haveto block the phone numbers of all those New York publishers who are driving youcrazy calling and wanting to publish your novels. Of course, I’ve not done anyof those things personally, but don’t worry. I have the secrets and when youleave here, you’ll have all the tools necessary to achieve fame and fortune inthe writing world.Guaranteed.Once you leave here,you’ll never again need to read a craft book, attend a conference like this,join a writer’s group, or read another novel to see how he or she does it.You’re going to get all the secrets right here! All you have to worry about iswhich island you’re going to buy to retire to…That’s the good news.And now, for some not-so-good news… What we like to call “the truth…” See? Youshould have just drunk the Kool-Aid and gone to the bar…First, you need to knowthat not everything in writing can be taught. For instance, do you really thinkthat anyone could study with William Faulkner for five years and then emergewriting as well as he could? Perhaps, but most likely not. There are somewriters who can do things that no one else in the world ever can.Here’s a true storythat illustrates why this is. Barry Bonds was interviewed one time, and hisanswer to a reporter’s question showed clearly how some things can never betaught.Thearticle:ON AUG.18, 2001, after it became a foregoneconclusion that Bonds would make a run at McGwire's single-season home runrecord, he hit a pitch from Jason Marquis -- 94 mph, chest-high, on the fists-- for his 54th homer. It wasn't his most memorable homer, but the physics ofit were astounding. About two weeks later, I interviewedhim for a story in The Magazine. I asked him to take me through that 2-2pitch: what he was thinking, what he was looking for, how he refined his swingto be short and quick enough to get the barrel to it. He refused. He wasn'tnasty; he just felt it was a senseless exercise.\"I just have it,\" he said.\"I can't explain it. You either have it or you don't, and I do. Peoplealways think there's an answer to everything, but there isn't. How can you dothat? I don't know. I just can. When people see something they've never seenbefore, the first thing they say is, 'How did you do that?' The next thing is,'Can you teach me?' The answer is no because you don't have it.\"That quote, and the laugh thatfollowed, is the essence of Bonds. His career was played to the backdrop offour words: You can't do this. Equal parts arrogance and truth, itbecame an unspoken mantra. It's the same mentality he used to separate himselffrom the game's pedestrian details. He routinely refused to show up for teamphotos during his years with the Giants. He stretched with his own stretchingcoach in the clubhouse rather than with his teammates on the field. He wasnotoriously stingy in providing assistance to teammates, acting as if theirmundane talents were contagious. His knowledge would remain the property of theone person who could use it best: Bonds himself.His grandiosity knew few bounds. Hearrived at his first spring training with the Giants with a chauffeur. Repletewith black suit and tie, Dennis drove Bonds to and from the ballpark for sixweeks in February and March of 1993. It was Barry being Barry, but within theclubhouse it was seen as a brazen act of hubris.And the crazy thing was: He knewbetter. It wasn't an inability to read the room or a mistaken belief thatteammates would understand how a man of his stature might need to display thegilded trappings of his success. It was a calculated effort to separate himselffrom the rank and file. You either have it or you don't, and I do.(Endof article)The same conceptapplies to the truly great writers. What they do can’t be taught. That doesn’tmean you can’t be as great or even greater than those folks were—it just meansyou can’t do what they did. You may end up doing something even greater but itwon’t be what they did—it’ll be something your own peculiar genius allowed youto do. This is not bad news—this is reality.            This is so crucial to learn. If you want to write like aFaulkner or a Hemingway, you probably won’t be able to achieve the particular masterythey had. Does that mean you’re doomed to mediocrity? Of course not! Bondscouldn’t pitch like Roger Clemens no matter how good a baseball player he was.Even though he was a good base stealer, he couldn’t steal bases the way RickyHenderson could. And, even though he ended up being the home run champion ofall time, he didn’t operate in a vacuum. There were hundreds of other majorleaguers playing at the same time he was and they were all successful. Justbeing on a major league roster is the equivalent of being a bestselling authorin the world of literature. Raymond Carver couldn’t write what FlanneryO’Connor wrote and if she’d been alive, during his career, she probablycouldn’t write what he did. But, guess what? They’re both great short storywriters. When Hemingway wrote, there were many, many other writers who weresuccessful as well. The same with every other famous or great writer.             I just want to create a realistic picture for you aswriters. Many things about writing can be taught. Many other things cannot betaught. It’s important to learn what you’re capable of learning and what can’trealistically be taught to you. Or anyone.            I want to talk today about how to become the best writeryou can be and hopefully show you some ways to shorten the time between whenyou first begin to write and when you’ve arrived as a good writer yourself.First, if you’rewriting a novel, it’s very important to understand the building blocks ofstory. There are two building blocks:1. Scene2. Sequel            The scene is a sequence of actions. This happened, whichled to this happening, which led to this… and so on. In a contemporary novel,the first action that needs to appear in the narrative is the incitingincident. This is very important. In older times, we could begin moreleisurely. We could begin with backstory or extensive setup. No longer.            A novel is about one thing only—trouble. And, trouble ina novel is about an individual with a compelling story problem. It’s not abouta bad situation—it’s about a bona fide, precise problem that can be clearlyidentified. And, it’s that problem that is going to occupy every page of thenovel until the end. Once the problem is resolved, the story’s over. And, innovel terms, the story problem has two components. One, it’s a surface problem,and two, it’s a story-worthy problem. Both are mirror images of each other. Iwon’t go into the difference and the sameness here—if you’re interested, it’sin my book Hooked.            In a movie, about all that are possible are scenes—unitsof action. However, in a novel, you’ve got an additional building block thatmakes a novel a far better form than a movie. In a novel, you also have thebuilding block of sequel.            Sequel is the aftermath of scene. It’s a moment ofreflection, where the character makes sense of the action. It’s where we get tosee his or her inner thoughts and emotions. It’s where flashbacks are allowed,where necessary backstory can emerge. It’s where the next plan of action isplanned by the protagonist.            Both are necessary in a good novel. If one is weak, thenovel as a whole will suffer. It’s your job as the writer to make sure bothwork equally well. If the action scenes are weak or boring, it doesn’t matterhow well-written the sequel is. If the action is strong but the sequel is weak,it becomes what my wife Mary calls a mindless chasey-fighty story or worse.            The best way to make a novel work is to alternate the twoelements. A bit of action, then a bit of sequel. That can vary, of course. Youcan have two, three, four scenes in a row, and then a sequel. The oppositerarely works however, where you have sequel, sequel, sequel, action. Thatusually leads to a interior monolog novel that only close relatives will read.The best way to construct a novel is to alternate the two elements, and maybe occasionally,having scene follow scene. Toward the conclusion of the novel, it’s best tohave multiple scenes. It’s a pacing technique that helps create a page-turner.By that time, the reader should be well aware of the character’s feeling andthought processes and sequel can be shortened quite a bit. We kind of know howthe character’s mind operates by then. There isn’t a formula to use in mixingscene and sequel, but a good estimate would be about 60% scene and 40% sequel.That isn’t hard and fast, however. Very good novels have been written with an80%-20% ratio. The opposite usually won’t work. To have a novel weighted moretoward sequel would almost always result in a mostly boring book.            A great book to explain all this in more detail is JackBickham’s Scene and Sequel.            Now. Here’s something you won’t hear much about, butwhich is one of the reasons a lot of stories writers attempt don’t work. It’sbecause of that advice to “get it down as quickly as you can and then rewriteit.” The problem with this is that very often the writer begins with apoorly-defined idea of the story they want to write. Too often, they begin whatBlake Snyder called “The smell of the rain on the road at dawn.” As he says: “Ican be driving down the street and see a guy with a t-shirt and think ‘That’s a story!!’ Is it? Doubtful. Itmay be the start of an idea, but for now it’s that thing all creative peopleget—if they’re lucky—the beginning ofart, but in and of itself, only interesting to you.”            Far too often, this is how many writers begin to write anovel. With nothing more than this. They feel that if they can just get a lotof stuff down, then later on they can go back and begin cutting away the deadwood and somehow sculpt what they have into a story. Almost always, this is astrategy doomed to failure. This is akin to a housewife dreaming of her dreamhouse one night and then waking up and getting together a crew to build it. Ifthe housewife is a billionaire and can keep tearing down the old mistakes andimproving it, bit by bit, perhaps she can eventually build that house. Eventhen, it probably won’t resemble the house she dreamed of. But, yet, this iswhat many writers do. They’ve also bought into that chestnut that “ideas arecheap.” Actually, ideas are cheap—however, solid story ideas that a novel can be created from are very dear andrare. That myth that any writer worth their salt has dozens and dozens if notthousands of ideas laying around in the ol’ brain pan and the only real problemis that they won’t live long enough to get ‘em all written. The truth is, mostof those millions of ideas are nothing more than the “smell of the rain on theroad in the morning.” It takes far more than that to create a viable novel.            The truth is, good story ideas aren’t that easy to comeby. Ideas—or fragments of ideas—are everywhere—but actual story ideas aren’t ascommon as folks would have you believe.            My own novel writing process begins with a story idea.But… and here’s a big BUT… that idea has to percolate in my brain andimagination from anywhere from five to ten years on average before it’s readyto be written. That doesn’t mean when I finish a novel, I have to start fromscratch and wait five or ten years to write the next one. At any given time, Ihave about ten story ideas I’ve been thinking about for many years until it’smatured enough to begin writing it. I daresay most of you have the sameexperience. Those are the stories you should be writing—not those “the smell ofthe rain” sudden inspirations that come to you. Those are the sparks that lightthe novel ideas but they haven’t yet achieved the level of story yet. Let thempercolate in your brain awhile. A longwhile. Eventually, most of them will wither away and die… and they should. Theones that remain—that you can’t shake—those are the worthwhile ideas and have achance to become a novel.             The main point I want to make here is to be sure your novelidea is really a story before you begin the arduous task of creating it onpaper.            Most successful novelists do this and even so, with thebest-laid plans, will end up not finishing the novel. Very often, that novelidea you had just doesn’t work. This is when you have to be ruthless and… KILLIT. While, yes, it’s possible to eventually wrestle a novel to the floor andcreate something publishable, you have to know when a particular work justisn’t going to become viable, not without a huge sacrifice of time and bloodand sweat and tears. More time, more blood and more sweat and tears than it’sgoing to be worth. This isn’t something you’ll hear very often. Most of theadvice is that one should never quit. All kinds of examples are trotted outwhere a writer spent ten years on a book (or more!) and the result was amasterpiece. What they usually don’t tell you is that for every writer whosucceeds like this, there are a thousand who eventually gave up entirely. Or,that if the masterpiece writer had abandoned the work earlier, they might havewritten five other books during that time that were just as good or possiblyeven better. This kind of thing comes about as a result of a culture that saysquitting anything is always a bad thing. Just remember that this isn’t LittleLeague where your dad is screaming at you to: “Never quit, Johnny! Only losersquit!” And you go on, day after miserable day, trying to do the impossible, andin the end, succeed only in prolonging the inevitable truth that: You suck atbaseball and aren’t ever going to get any better, at least in a reasonableamount of time, by, say the age of fifty-five.            Here’s the good news. We’re all grown up now and don’thave to listen to the adults in our house screaming at us to Never Quit! It’sperfectly okay to quit under the right circumstances. Remember, you’re notquitting writing—you’re quitting anovel that is unlikely to work. And, you’ll know if it’s a novel that youshould persevere with or not. Just listen to the sane voice in your head.            This doesn’t mean that you should give up on everyproject that proves difficult. Most novels don’t come easily. But, there’s adifference between a difficult task and an impossible one. Make sure you knowthe difference. Most successful novelists I know end up finishing about one outof every three novels that they begin. And, that’s after they’ve winnowed outprobably dozens if not hundreds of ideas.            Learn to enjoy the killing of such a novel. It’s bykilling the losers that you’re letting the healthy ones live. Not enough issaid about the value of abandoning crap. If it’s crap—and you should be able totell the difference—reworking it endlessly ain’t gonna turn it into a bouquetof roses. Learn to be a cold-blooded assassin.            Here’s another truism. All novels in the beginning stagesof writing them are trying to be crap. At the first moment you put something onpaper, it’s trying to be really bad, it’s trying to be boring, to beunstructured, to be pointless, it’s trying to be digressive. You have to propit up at every stage if it’s going to be any good. You have to be really anassassin, going after the boring parts, and going to the parts that really getto your heart and propping them up even more. If you think you’re going to “fixit later” I think you’re going to eventually discover that doesn’t happen. Youhave to be ruthless. And, immediately. Anything that has a chance at being goodmeans you’re going to have to be really, really tough. This is why I’madamantly against the advice to “get it down lickety-split while in the throesof the muse… and then go back later to fix it.” If you’ve tried that and don’thave much in the way of publication to show for it, that’s maybe a clue that itdoesn’t work. Every bumper sticker piece of writing advice isn’t good.            Failure is a big part of success. (I sound like a DaleCarnegie ad, don’t I!) But, it’s true. We have to fail, over and over and over.It’s by failing that eventually we begin to win. Eventually, if you keep onwriting, you’re going to stumble onto something you’re writing that’s socompelling, so good, so memorable and special… that the five or ten projectsyou began and abandoned just don’t matter. They’re just what you had to gothrough to get to the good stuff finally.            And now, here’s the biggest secret of all. What writingteachers and craft books, mostly never tell you.            Most of us begin writing because we know clearly whatgood writing looks like. We’ve simply read so danged much, we know good writingthe instant we encounter it. We want to write because we LOVE good writing.            So, we begin writing and for the first few years there’sthis gap. What we’re getting down just isn’t that good. It’s trying to begreat, but it just isn’t making it. Your writing isn’t all that good, butwhat’s still the same is that you still know what good writing looks like. And,yours isn’t matching up. Your taste in what’s good writing is killer, butwhat’s disappointing is that your own effort doesn’t measure up. It’s trying tobe good but you can tell it’s crappy.            And this is when a lot of writers give up. Try as hard asyou can, you just can’t seem to create to the same standard as what you know isgood. This is when lots of writers quit. Here’s a secret. Almost all successfulwriters went through the same thing. Most spent years knowing that what theywere creating wasn’t as good as what they knew to be good writing. They knew they were falling short. They knewit didn’t have that special “thing” they wanted it to have. Here’s the thing: EVERYBODY goes through this. EVERYBODY. You have to know that this istotally normal and that we all go through the same thing. You’re not the onlyperson to experience this gap between what you know to be good writing and thecrap you’re putting out. The difference is the successful writers plow throughthis period in their lives. The unsuccessful ones don’t—they quit before theyshould.            The most important thing you can do during this phase ofyour writing career is simple. DO A LOT OF WRITING. Do a huge volume of work.Write every single day. Set yourself deadlines that you convince yourself youhave to stick to. So many words a day or week. So many stories finished by suchand such a day. It’s only by going through a volume of work that you’re goingto catch up and narrow that gap between that good writing you recognize inothers and your own work. If you stay the course it will happen. This is thepoint at which most writers quit. Don’t let that be you. Trust that you willemerge from this a good writer.            In my own case, that took about ten years. I even gotstuff published during that time. But, only rarely. I came close to quittingmany times. Just thought I’d never arrive at the place where I was consistentlygood. That’s a crushing thing to feel. And, I know a lot of you feel that wayright now. I’ve been there—I know.            During this time, I even got books published. My firstnovel even won an award—it was awarded a Special Citation by the Violet CrownBook Award. But, I wasn’t a good writer yet. That would take another ten yearsbefore I could consistently get down on paper the kind of material that matchedup to what I knew was good writing.            It takes awhile. It’s going to take you each awhile ifyou aren’t there yet. It’s normal to take awhile and you simply have to fightthrough it and keep writing. And, when you emerge, you’ll be fierce. You’ll bea warrior!            There is a major pitfall most of us fall into. When youfirst pick up a pen or turn on the computer, there’s a tendency to writeoutside of our own voices. To sound… like a writer. Or, what we mistakenlythink a writer sounds like. We’ll want to sound like Faulkner or FlanneryO’Connor or even John Grisham, for example. Whoever. The problem is, there’salready a Faulkner. There’s no room for a Faulkner, Junior. We already have thereal deal. We need writers who sound like themselves. Who write in theirone-of-a-kind, original-diginal voices. Who are themselves on the page. Once webegin to accept that our own voice has value and is interesting, then we’vemade a quantum leap toward matching up our vision of what is good and your ownwork.(If you're interested in finding your own voice a bit quicker, you might glom onto this one.)            Here’s where the crux of the problem lies, I believe.That standard of good writing we’re trying to match is viewed incorrectly by usand it takes time to learn this. We’re only paying attention to the outward voiceof the writer. And, this is where we keep falling down. We’re trying to mimicthat particular voice. And, that’s the one thing we should be avoiding. It’slike a person who wants to be a TV broadcast journalist and his hero is WalterCronkite. Cronkite is his standard of excellence. This guy doesn’t realize thatwe already have a Walter Cronkite and that no one is looking for a Cronkite,Junior. Or, pick a contemporary broadcaster, doesn’t matter who. Virtually noone in the audience wants a clone or twin of that person. But, we know thatthat person is the standard of excellence. So what happens to all of thesebright-eyed wannabe broadcasters? Well, to many of them, the same thing happensto the writer whose idea of a good writer is say William Faulkner. They beginto imitate the “master.” And this is why it often takes years and years beforethe gap between the standard and our own writing begins to narrow. We’re mostlylooking at the outward manifestation of their art. In the case of thebroadcaster, they begin to assume the personal tics of Cronkite. The speechpatterns he favors. The way he emphasizes certain words and parses his sentences.His steely stare. Maybe even his haircut and suit choice. In the case of thewriter who holds Faulkner up as his standard of excellence, he or she might dothe same things. They look at the cadence of his sentence, the vocabularychoices Faulkner makes, the syntax of his prose, etc. That person is looking atthe superficial aspects of Faulkner but never dig into the real thing that he’sdoing. They’re looking at superficial artifacts. We’ve all probably done that.We look at the words on the page and think that if we can just learn to stringtogether similarly-sounding sentences we’ll have arrived. Alas, it does not andcannot work that way. We need to instead be looking at the attitude, thepersonal stance of the writer to his story, the emotions of the writer towardhis or her work. We need to focus on our own emotional stances toward what wewant to write. When we learn to do that, we begin to formulate our own voicesand when that day arrives, we will have become good writers. Warriors. You justhave to keep pushing through all that junk and one day it will happen. Ourwriting will no longer be crap and we’ll have become… warriors.            And this is what I wish for everyone here.            I hope this gives you some food for thought and that youfind it helpful.            Don’t give up too soon.Here are some otherthings to consider:Have something worth saying.In his book Culture Care, artist Makoto Fujimura     tells a story he confesses may be legendary about a Yale student taking     Hebrew from the great Old Testament scholar Brevard Childs. The student,     discontent with his grades, asked the scholar how he could raise them.     Childs’s answer: “Become a deeper person.”Peggy Noonan, writer of seven bookson politics, religion, and culture, and weekly columnist forThe Wall StreetJournal,  at one time the speechwriter for the man considered The Great Communicator—Ronald Reagan. In her bookSimply Speaking, she says that what moves people in a speech is thelogic. The words “Tear down this wall, Mr. Gorbachev” are not all that poeticwhen taken at face value. But they express something that resonates in thehuman heart. In the words of Robert Frost, “Something is there that doesn’tlove a wall.”In the same way that logic is what moves people in a speech, logic is whatmoves people in writing. And to have logic, to move people, we must havesomething worth saying. In fact, probably about 90% of writing is havingsomething worth saying. And how do we get something worth saying? By expandingthe world of ideas to which we expose ourselves and by cultivating a rich innerlife.Decrease your vision. That is, “think local.” Start with your family. Doug     Bender, the bestselling author of I Am Second: Real Stories. Changing     Lives. wrote a book for an audience of one. When Doug’s wife had a     miscarriage, it grieved the Bender’s little girl. So Doug wrote a child’s     book about death and loss just for her. A seminary professor told hisstudents, “Stop thinking you will go out and save the world, and instead becomethe best family member you can be, the most grateful child of your parents, thegreatest and most dependable encourager in your church, the best contributor toyour community.” We influence the world one small corner at a time. Cherish thesmall.In the days when Abraham’sdescendants had been carried off from Israel to Babylon, their prophet,Jeremiah, sent a letter to King Nebuchadnezzar for the surviving leaders inexile. Jeremiah’s counsel: “Build houses and settle down; plant gardens and eatwhat they produce…. Seek the peace and prosperity of the city to which I havecarried you into exile” (Jere. 29:1–7). Seeking the good of the city where welive is always good counsel. So write for your kids, if you have any.Contribute good columns to the local paper. Donate some book reviews for yourfavorite local web site. Do readings at the library. And do so simply to giveback and because you wish to make your corner of the world a better place.Write what contributes to human flourishing, not what     you perceive as the next hot market. Trying to predict what will     sell is like leaning on cobwebs. Just about the time you find a post to     rest against, it gives way. By the time you finish writing a book to meet     demand, the market will have left you in the dust. So write what you love     to write and/or what you can write with excellence. Measure success accurately. You will be tempted to measure your own success     by a number of externals that have nothing to do with your worth. Tell     yourself they are lies.The only human-made structurevisible from space was not the Golden Gate Bridge or the Eiffel Tower or eventhe tallest building in the world, but only the Great Wall of China. Think ofall the amazing structures that “failed” to make that list.But that does not make these structures failures. It just means that whenmeasured by one narrow definition of success, they failed. As writers, anynumber of false measures can make us feel like losers. Did our last book failto earn out its advance? Did we do a book tour? Did the work gain rave reviewsin Publishers Weekly and Library Journal? These are not accuratemeasures of whether we can write. Lots of crummy books sell big. Many divergentbooks make their authors lots of money, but that does not make the books or theauthors successes.So measure not by money or fame, butin influence on human flourishing. And of course, that is impossible tomeasure. Which is precisely my point.To sumup: stay the course. Everybody goes through the period where what they createdoesn’t match up with their sense of what’s good writing. You simply have tokeep on working and eventually you’ll emerge and it will. This is the pointwhere we lose most writers. Don’t be one of those who quit just before theyattain the prize.Inclosing, let me quote the words of that immortal philosopher, Red Green, whosays: Keep your stick on the ice. We’re all in this together and I’m pullingfor you.Thankyou. Les Edgerton"},
{"title": "AUDITOR POSITIONS ARE OPEN", "date": "Saturday, January 9, 2016", "text": "Hifolks,Well,our latest bootcamp class session has ended and in about a week (Jan. 17) anew, ten-week session will be beginning. I’ve heard from several people who areinterested in joining us, but alas, we only had two openings for writers thistime and both were filled from the auditors who were on board last session.This is the first place we always go to when we need new class members.Ourauditor program has been a resounding success for the several years we’ve hadit. Basically, auditors have access to everything we do in class at all times.They see how we operate, how we present our work, how it’s critiqued, and areprivy to all the many conversations about craft the members have. It’s exactlylike sitting in class with the only proviso that they can’t participateactively. Many auditors have told me that they learned more by sitting on thesidelines observing that they did in their university classes on writing. Weare a serious group, with but one goal—that every member become published andpublished well. Our track record in that regard is excellent. And, we expectthat goal to continue next session. As many as six writers will have finishedthe novels they’ve been working on in class and I believe all of them will finda legitimate publisher. A few nearing the completion of their novels havealready secured good agents and are just putting the final polish on theirmanuscripts.Whichmeans that we will probably have several openings in the following session. Notthat many—most who finish their novels opt to remain in class as they work ontheir next work. People who are already in class always have first dibs onbeing in the next session. When we do have openings, we’ll solicit from theranks of the current auditors. If openings are not filled thusly, we then openit up to anyone who applies. This rarely happens.A few years ago in Scottsdale with some of the class. Holly, Linda, moi, Mary and Maegan.Thepurpose of this post is to let people know that we are always open to auditors.There are no limits on the number of auditors who can join us, simply becausewe don’t have to take any time for their work. It’s that simple. That’s alsothe reason we maintain class size at 10-12 people each session. That’s thenumber of participants that we can serve properly and fairly and thoroughly.Any more than that, we would run into a time problem. Both myself and all theclass members take significant time to read and comment on the submissions eachweek, and if we added more to class, we’d have to spend less time on everyoneelse’s work and we’re just not going to do that.Theway class works, the class is divided into two groups. Holly Love, our classadministrator and member herself, assigns each group to a color. Six in each group.Each writer is required to read and make detailed comments on the other fivemembers in his/her group and return those for the class as a whole to view.That doesn’t mean that they can’t read and comment on any writers outside theirgroup—they certainly can and do—but these are their required reads. A few yearsago, each class member had to read and comment on everyone else’s work inclass, but it got to be too much for more than a few, so we’ve divided theclass in two now. I’m the only one who reads and comments on everyone’s work.What’sdifferent about our class is that we don’t care about placating people’sfeelings. We’re not mean-spirited, but our standards are based on helping ourfellow writers create a publishable novel. We’re not there to make people feelgood or to lavish praise on each other. If praise is warranted, they’ll receiveit, but our biggest focus is on what isn’t working and how to fix it.Thisis the reason I formed this group several years ago. I’d taught in variousuniversities and other venues, both online and on site, including the UCLA Writer’sProgram, the University of Toledo, Phoenix College (the “real” college, notthat internet pretend school you see on billboards), St. Francis University,Trine University, the New York Writer’s Workshop, Writer’s Digest OnlineClasses, Vermont College, and other venues. The reason I quit and opened upthis class was that every one of those venues required their teachers topractice the “sandwich” method of teaching. Put simply, you were to provide abit of praise (the bread), a piece of criticism (the meat), and then anotherbit of praise (more bread, ala the sandwich method. I simply couldn’t do it anylonger. The truth is, often there is nothing to praise and I had to make upsomething. Mostly to salve their feelings. And, to make sure they had apleasant experience and would return to take another class.  Ijust couldn’t do it any longer. I kept seeing students who were no closer tobeing published than when they began and they kept clinging on to the bits ofpraise handed out with their sandwich as some kind of justification that theywere “writing.” Well, many were writing… just not writing well.Itwas then I realized that praising someone for bullshit wasn’t a kindness atall. If they didn’t know their writing wasn’t working, they’d never do anythingto get better. And, by and large, many didn’t. Many were perfectly happy,sitting in a warm, fuzzy club that kept feeding them these sandwiches. Kind oflike more than one local writer’s club. Most people didn’t want to tell othersthe truth, which often was… “Your writing flat-out sucks.” When you tellsomeone that, they have two choices. 1. Disagree, often violently. 2. Agree,and do something about it. I only wanted to spend time with that second group.When I first began the classes, I fully expected a huge turnover each newsession. We had a class structure and philosophy that didn’t deliver sandwichesto the others. If a writer’s work sucked, we told them that. With no mincing ofwords. But… and here’s the big “but”—we didn’t just say it sucked; we told themwhy and we also told them how they could improve it. Don’t misunderstand—we don’tpromote “formulas” or anything like that in class. We tell them why it wasn’tworking and suggested how they could make it more publishable.Whathappened was that I got a huge surprise. People didn’t quit. They forged on andenrolled in a second class. And third… and… Their books began gettingpublished. It turns out people aren’t as thin-skinned as too often thought. Itturns out there are a lot of people who actually want someone to tell them whythey’re not getting published and offer them tools to actually find a publisherand see their work in print. Some do… quit, that is… but not nearly as many asI figured we’d get. Some truly tough writers, who didn’t believe that geniuswas the only requirement to see their books end up on bookstore shelves. Whoknew that hard work, patience and attitude were just as important and maybeeven more so.Thoseearly folks (some of who are still with us, four years later), created a namefor our class. It has become “Les Edgerton’s Bootcamp for Writers.” And, it isa bootcamp. We don’t tolerate sissies or quitters or know-it-alls or needyfolks. Just don’t have time for that kind of person. We welcome men and womenwho are willing to do the hard, hard work of becoming publishable writers.Anyway,sorry to go on like this, but I’m extremely proud of the writers in ourclasses.

{"title": "RERUN OF A PC SPEECH", "date": "Thursday, December 10, 2015", "text": "Hi folks,Recently, I began a discussion on Facebook about censorship and the current malignant culture of Political Correctness. The responses obtained have convinced me that perhaps it's a good time to repost a lecture I delivered in 1997 at Vermont College and which was later published in several publications, including my story collection, GUMBO YA-YA, published by Spinetingler Press. Although I've published it here several times, it just seems like now a repost might be timely. I think if you read it, the signs of where PCism was heading were evident even back then. What I didn't foreseee at the time is the extent that politicians, academia and the mainstream press would kowtow to the culture of being \"politically correct.\" It's simply astounding... and frightening--at least to me.Anyway, here's the whole article. I've bolded a few areas I feel particularly relevant. Be forewarned: There are instances of cursing, etc. Here goes:CENSORSHIP AND WHY I LOVE CHARLESBUKOWSKIByLes Edgerton(LectureDelivered to MFA in Writing Students & Faculty at Vermont College, January8, 1997. Later published in Circle KMagazine. Included in the story collection, Gumbo Ya—Ya, Snubnose Press.)            Like most of you in this room, I’vealways written, always had to write. I had this thing inside me that said I hadto be a writer. Notice, I said had tobe. Not “wanted” or “yearned to be”. Hadto be. There was no choice in the matter. God looked down and saw thislittle runty red thing laying in his bassinet, sucking down a PBR with aformula chaser, and He said, “I need another writer for my Grand Scheme,” andBingo! There I was. A writer. When God Himself says you’re gonna be a writer,then, boy, you better be a writer. You play the hand you’re dealt.            I didn’t have any argument withthat. I mean, who argues with God? Except, maybe Francois Camoin. But I didn’thave the advantage of being French and cynical and all that like Francois did-I didn’t even know where to begin to buy a beret or a black painter’s smock oran attitude. I mean, for Christ’s sake, I was a kid in Texas. None of those things could be gottenin Texas. Ifyou couldn’t barbecue it or shoot it, fuck it or ride it, forget it. Notavailable west of the Pecos.            So I had to be a writer who grew upin Texas andmy opportunities were pretty limited because of that.            Unfortunately, I was the product ofa traditional American education. I say “unfortunately” because the literatureI was exposed to in that system included what might be termed “safe” writers.Thackery, Milton, Shakespeare, Melville, Whitman, Steinbeck, Faulkner...youknow the list. It’s the list we’ve all been exposed to.            I tried. Believe me, I tried. But mymodels for writing were all wrong, in a way. They were guys like Balzac andDickens, Henry James and Jonathon Swift. Ladies like Louisa May Alcot. Greatwriters, sure, but from another planet as far as I was concerned. I grew up ina bar, saw my first man killed when I was twelve - shot six feet in front ofme. I was the night dispatcher for my grandmother’s cab company when thathappened and had to phone the police. Nothing like that ever happened in Little Women, near as I could tell.            One by one, I tried all the genresand styles I became exposed to and one thing or the other doomed eachexperiment. I mean, I loved the books I read and of course I tried imitatingthem in style and content, but even though they were wonderful books, theyweren’t about worlds I inhabited. I guess I assumed you weren’t allowed towrite about the planet I happened to find myself on.            I just didn’t realize you wereallowed to write about real life, at least life as I knew it. It was my firstbrush with censorship, although I didn’t know it. Our local public library,which was my only source of reading material just didn’t carry anything in thecontemporary realism category. Looking back, I know now the head librarianhauncho probably felt those kinds of books would damage my tender and developingcharacter, so even if they had such books on their shelves, they were kept fromyoungsters like myself.            So, for years, I continued writingwhat I thought was the only kind of stuff that could get published and littleby little became more and more disillusioned with writing and literature ingeneral. Perhaps if I had gone to college at an earlier age, I might havediscovered there were books out there to which I could relate, but I didn’t. Iwas in the Navy and then in prison, and in those kinds of environments you justdon’t run across literature that’s much different than what you’d find on youraverage high school English recommended reading list.            I quit writing for a number ofyears, because, frankly, I was bored. It was by chance only that I came upon awriter who relit the literary fires.            Charles Bukowski.            Wow.            Lights went off.            This guy was doing things I didn’tknow you were allowed to do. He was writing about life, about real life.Nitty-gritty, down and dirty life. Lots of it was funny, most of it was sad,but it all touched me, way down deep there in that literary G-spot all writers(and readers) are forever trying to connect with.            I read another guy about the sametime that turned me on fire inside as well. Kurt Vonnegut. I read this interviewin the Paris Review in which he said,“Literature should not disappear up its own asshole, so to speak.” Big spark ofunderstanding there. Ol’ Kurt said exactly what I had been unable to articulatefor a long time, ever since I started reading the “masters.” The old boys (andgirls) had some good stuff going for them, but it seems like literarysphincterism had set in by the time I came along, all these deifiedcontemporary writers were sitting around contemplating their own navels, itseemed. I was reading all this stuff about upper-middle class angst. Reallyjazzy stuff, like how some guy was sorrowing because all he had out of life washis Chrysler agency and ten million bucks and was searching his soul and was inthis big blue funk because he hadn’t gone off with Easy Sally that time at thesenior prom way back in H.S. Every book I picked up at that period seemed tohave a similar theme. I just couldn’t identify. Hell, I never was able toafford a used Chrysler, let alone anentire agency, and I had run off withEasy Sally--yeah, I was that guy, the one in the leather jacket and theslicked-back hair--really! I had hair, back then--and believe me there isn’t alot of angst to be used for material in the writing trade when you’re sittingin the trailer and Easy Sally is looking like Even Easier Sally and you don’tknow where your next PBR is coming from and the TV is flashing those littletornado warnings across the bottom of the screen and you’re trying to quiet thelittle rascal on your knee that has your last name but the propane deliveryman’s hook nose. I just knewsomewhere deep inside my bones I couldn’t fake writing a whole, entire book outof what it meant to be the Executive Vice President in Charge of Sales forSoutheastern Florida for the Tidy Bowl Corp and sorrowing over the lost babe ofhis childhood or the sad fact that he’d chucked it all and gone off to paintTahitian sunsets. Or that his wife had. Crap like that.            All of a sudden, here’s this guyBukowski writing about shit I knew about.About whores and hustlers, winos and fathead bosses who were always worriedtheir wives would go to bed with the help so they got their mad out in the openright away.            I picked up a book of his, acollection of stories called “The Most Beautiful Woman in Town and OtherStories.” I loved those other stories. It was like sitting down with a homeboyor your rap partner in the joint and swapping lies. Better yet; it was entertaining. All of a sudden, Iremembered why I had first started writing. To make someone laugh. Or cry.Learn something about another human being. Just feel something. Feel what I was feeling. Here was this guy,Bukowski, and he was doing exactly what I’d always wanted to do.            Bukowski’s stories weren’t aboutmiddle-aged English professors who were all in a fret because their wives nolonger get excited sitting around listening to them conjugate French verbs anddeducing that their lives, the meaningful portions of them, anyway, were over.Some of these guys, it seemed, took 400 pages to figure out why the major babein their life was leaving. They were bored,Jack.*                                                          *                                                          *            I know this was billed as a lectureon censorship and you may be wondering where the censorship angle comes in.Well, where it comes in is that not only were folks like Bukowski not beingpublished by so-called “respectable” presses in this country, but other booksby writers like him were not generally available to people like myself. Theyweren’t talked about by our English teachers, they weren’t on the shelves ofour hometown libraries--or if they were, they were kept from our view andknowledge. In other words, there was a form of censorship operating that keptthis kind of book from me and others that exists today and it is this and otherforms of censorship, overt and covert, that I’ll get to, by and by. I want toshow what it is about Bukowski that turned my whole life around. Well, not my life--I mean, I still have to mow thegrass on Saturday and take out the garbage--but this story saved my writing life, which is, after all, theonly life worth having.            The story was The Fiend. You may have read it. If you did, you either became afan of Bukowski’s or you hated his guts. Personally, I became a fan.            Basically, it’s a story about amiddle-aged guy named Martin Blanchard, who’s been defeated by alcohol. He’slost his wife and family, two wives, twofamilies, actually, his job, everything.Twenty-seven jobs he’s gone through. That’s a lot of jobs. This guy’s justyour basic average slob who can’t leave the juice alone. He’s reduced to livingin this squalid apartment, four flights up, and drinking wine. His only sourceof income is his unemployment checks and money left in parking meters. Badlyeducated, yet he listens to classical music, preferring Mahler.            He begins to notice this little girloutside playing. He begins to notice she has on these interestingpanties...and... you guessed it, he finds himself masturbating. Afterwards, hefeels relief. It’s out of my mind, hethinks after he gets off. I’m free again.Only, he’s not. It’s just the beginning of a new obsession, a perversion. Forthe first time in months, perhaps years, he has an interest. It repels him, buthe can’t resist it, either.            At first, he thinks it’s justsomething weird that overtook him and now it’s out of his system, but after hedrinks his last bottle of wine, he sees the little girl outside in the streetand begins to get hard again. He decides to go to the store to replenish hiswine supply and as he walks outside he notices the little girl and the twolittle boys have gone into the garage across the street. He finds himselfwalking into the garage behind them and shutting the doors.            He then proceeds to rape thelittle girl, in very graphic detail. When you read this part, if it doesn’tmake you sick, you’re probably beyond the kind of help counseling can give youat this late date. All the while he’s committing this heinous act, the two boysare asking him questions. They express genuine curiosity and don’t seem to beoverly-frightened, exhibiting more of an amoral attitude than anything.Bukowski does something quite skillful here. Instead of having the two youngboys be scared shitless, he shows them to be mainly curious about what Martinis doing to their friend. These kids are witnessing something pretty horrible,but then they’re just kids, and there’s an amoral innocence about theirreaction that blurs the morality. Raping a child is without doubt a trulyhorrible crime, with no redemption in such an act, but since it’s hard to wholeheartedlycondemn the two boys the reader is moved into an area of moral ambiguity thatcreates a kind of complicity with the boys. The reader then becomes, like theboys, a kind of voyeur to Martin’s act. This also helps humanize the monsterMartin is, inasmuch as any such person could be seen as having human qualities.            The kicker for me in this story wasa line a little earlier on in the story, as Martin is kissing the child, justbefore he rapes her, and the narrator says, “Martin’s eyes looked into her eyes and it was a communication betweentwo hells--one hers, the other his.” When I read this line, it was as ifI’d been struck by literary lightening.            What I have always thought goodwriting was about was people, allkinds of folks, and what made writing about people good, was that it showed you something about them. Something youdidn’t know or were confused on or were ignorant of. And not just politicallycorrect folks, either. In fact, preferably notpolitically correct folks. Is there a more boring bunch in the SolarSystem? You see, I was in jail, I was an alcoholic, I was a drug user, I wasall those kinds of dudes that aren’t allowed to buy a house in WestchesterCounty--well, that’s not right, exactly, according to my New York friends, mostof the citizens in Westchester fitthat description--but you know what I mean--and I knew they weren’t all weak orstupid or worthless. They didn’t all start out that way. Something happenedalong the road. Some of the most intellectual conversations I’ve ever heardwere in soup kitchens. I met a guy once who used to teach physics at M.I.T.,one fine Thanksgiving Day at the free turkey blowout the Salvation Army washosting in Baltimore.This guy could make hydrogen bombs in his sleep and probably cure cancer if hegot a year off the sauce.            Anyway, back to Bukowski and hisstory about the child rapist. Bukowski doesn’t excuse this motherfucker, normake him out to be anything but the monster he is, but he does show ussomething about the guy which we probably wouldn’t have known in any other way.He shows us there’s a human being running around inside the guy someplace. Asomewhat troubled human being, butone of us at any rate. And this is what literature should be all about. Showingus to one another. The good, the bad, the ugly as well as the downrightperverts.            All his stuff isn’t good. In fact, alot of it stinks. Kind of masturbation-on-the-page type of stuff. He considershimself a genius--well, he is,actually--and Bukowski seems to have thought that everything he had a thoughton was important because it came out of his brain. Not true. That virtuallyeverything he wrote got printed may not have been his fault, but more the faultof publishers who bought into his self-created myth.            Almost any other writer that thissame story would have occurred to, would have taken the point of view of anyonebut Martin’s. The little girlherself, the boys, the cops who came and arrested him, the parents. An adultwho discovered the crime. A fly on the wall. To write this kind of story fromthe pov of the perp, in my mind, is the stuff of literary courage. It’s verydangerous stuff. It you don’t bring it off, it almost makes the writer appearas if he excused Martin for what he’s done, which would have made Bukowski an evenbigger monster than his character. What he’s been able to do is present Martinexactly as he is - a hideous member of the human race...but amazingly, yet...still a member of humanity. It’sinteresting in one respect, too, in that Bukowski wrote this story in the thirdperson, while most of his other writing is first person and confessionalautobiography. It looks as if he wanted to make sure readers didn’t confuse thenarrator with the author, which, if he did, renders him just a little lesscourageous. I don’t want to think of him that way, so I’ll give him the benefitof the doubt.            With that one little sentence, “Martin’s eyes looked into her eyes and itwas a communication between two hells--one hers, the other his.”, Bukowskigives us an insight that is deeply profound. And that, in my opinion, is whatgreat writing is all about.            It takes enormous courage to be ableto write about the kinds of people Bukowski does. Readers, even intelligentreaders, tend to associate the writer with the narrator. In my first semester,I wrote a story about a character who was a criminal, and I had the concernthat the reader of the piece would want to know if I had been a criminalmyself. I addressed my concern to my first advisor here, Phyllis Barber, andshe said, “an intelligent reader will never ask if a piece of writing isautobiographical, so don’t worry about it.” Well, Phyllis meant well, and in aperfect world, this would be true, but believe me, even very intelligentreaders at least wonder if the stuff they’re reading comes from the writer’sown experience and even the brightest of readers will wonder if very negativeor dark stuff is what the author really thinks and feels. It’s just humannature. It’d be nice if readers accepted work labeled as fiction as justthat--fiction--but the truth of the matter is, there’s something of theprurient in all of us that makes us hope that the stuff on the page--especially the dark, forbidden stuff--isderived from the real experience of its creator. It gives most of us adelicious little shiver of horror to be standing this close to depravitywithout actually having to get any of it on ourselves. There is some part ofalmost all our souls that craves the darker side of life. We are alternatelytitillated and repulsed by immoral behavior and I think that is the reasonbooks and stories and movies about bad guys are so well-attended. We cansatisfy this baser part of our souls in a safe and acceptable manner, so longas they get put in their places in the end.            Most of my own writing output hasbeen about such people, and without exception, those who read it and areacquainted with me, will come up and ask, in almost an embarrassed fashion,“Was that yourself you were writing about?” Up until just recently, I wouldusually answer that, uh, no, I just knowsome people like that. I’ve usually taken the coward’s way out. Just recently,I’ve begun to admit that, yes, I’ve done many of the things that show up in mystories. I’ve been a criminal, done time, sold drugs, been involved in varioussexual aberrations, broken many and diverse laws. I don’t do them anymore--well, not as many--I’d be roomtemperature by now if I’d continued doing some of the things I used to. And,I’m a different person than I was when I was involved in those things. That’swhy I’ve usually lied when asked if the author of my work was the same as thenarrator. Most folks, no matter what they say, will assume you’re still thatkind of person and that kind of reputation will keep you from getting some of thenicer rewards of our civilization.            The thing that writers like Bukowskirepresent to me is truth. As a groupof animals endowed with a superior intellect--as compared with, say, monkeys ortse-flies--and if we do indeed have this intelligence, then what we ought to beabout primarily is the pursuit of truth. This is what education should beabout, although sadly, it seems not to be the Holy Grail it once was. Back in“my day” which was the nineteen-sixties, that’s what a lot of us wereinterested in. Truth. We were into toppling institutions. Institutions we feltwere based on lies. And, I guess that’s why writers like Bukowski appeal to meso much. The one thing we weren’t being in the sixties was safe. Although, that’s not entirely true. There was a largecontingent of folks that were concerned mainly with making sure they didn’t goto Vietnamand get shot at. A lot of the hyperbole in that era was, in fact, centeredaround changing a system that could put one’s physical unit in jeopardy. Butfor many of us, especially those of us who had been in the military at thetime, the things we were involved in were anything but safe. That’s what seemsto be missing today. Most of the stuff I pick up and read, while quite good inmany instances, is for the most part, safewriting. The mood has changed, as it always does, but the direction it hasmoved to is a dangerous one.            I’m speaking here of the phenomenonsweeping through this country referred to as being “politically correct.” Likemany grandiose ideas, there is a noble intent at the center of this outlook,but also like many other popular notions, it has been perverted until it is theantithesis of what it originated as. Being PC nowadays amounts to out and outcensorship in my opinion. For every writer like Bukowski, William Vollmann, andDavid Sedaris who breaks through and becomes a cult hero, there are hundreds ofwriters who are being stifled, vilified, and destroyed, simply because they donot preach the party’s message nor do they conform to the parameters set up bythe PC folks who seem to be in charge. Too often they are stifling themselvesby trying to placate society. What used to be considered simply bad tastenowadays takes on a more sinister connotation and that is dangerous if we valuefreedom of thought and value the time-honored tradition of the debate of ideaswhich is the only viable method for advancing knowledge and understanding.            Plato himself spoke about politicalcorrectness in The Republic, when hesaid:            “Then the first thing will be toestablish a censorship of the writers of fiction, and let the censors receiveany tale of fiction which is good, and reject the bad; and we will desiremothers and nurses to tell their children the authorized ones only.” How aboutthat.            In another of Bukowski’s stories, 3 Chickens, he continually beats hisgirlfriend. Definitely not a PCstory. Here are some direct quotes from the story:            onceshe was screaming these insanities from the fold-down bed in our apartment. Ibegged her to stop, but she wouldn’t. finally, I just walked over, lifted upthe bed with her in it and folded everything into the wall.            thenI went over and sat down and listened to her scream.            butshe kept screaming so I walked over and pulled the bed out of the wall againthere she lay, holding her arm, claiming it was broken.and            now,another time she angered me and I slapped her but it was across the mouth andit broke her false teeth.            Iwas surprised that it broke her false teeth and I went out and got this supercement glue and I glued her teeth together for her. it worked for awhile andthen one night as she sat there drinking her wine she suddenly had a mouthfulof broken teeth.            thewine was so strong it undid the glue. it was disgusting. we had to get her somenew teeth, how we did it, I don’t quite remember, but she claimed they made herlook like a horse.and            thebar was full, every seat taken. I lifted my hand. I swung. I backhanded her offthat god damned stool. she fell to the floor and screamed.            There are more abusive incidents inthe story. This is horrible stuff to anyone--and I imagine that’s most ofus--who is interested in consciousness-raising about spouse abuse andbattering--but there is a value to being exposed to this kind of material. Howelse can we understand anything about violence unless we observe and portray itaccurately? It exists, just as surely as serial killers exist, and how can onecombat evil unless one understands its nature?            GordonWeaver, who was on the faculty here at Vermont until a few years ago, told mein an interview, that, “If our special interest, as writers and/or editors, isthe precise use of language toward the end of a viable perception of and effecton reality, we may argue there is some virtue implicit in any utterance (written or oral) that confronts the consensus of anygathering.” He gives an example. “There is a cost that will be paid by allconcerned if one tells a Polack joke in the presence of Poles, but I contendthe cost is greater if one stifles or sanitizes the anecdote.” Gordon hassomething here, I think. Weaver also told me that academicians are perhaps thenewest bullies on the censorship block and perhaps the most dangerous of all.He stated that, “There is a greater danger, it seems to me, when the censorscome from the ranks of the presumably ‘enlightened’. It is not surprising thata number of college and university communities nurture factions who wish tocontrol free speech; it is unsettling when more sophisticated citizens(faculty) add their clout to movements desiring to police our utterance in theinterests of what minority or another deems politically incorrect.”            Whetheror not you agree with writers like Bukowski, or Weaver for that matter, isunimportant. What is important is that they and others of diverse opinions havea forum to be heard and read. That forum is disintegrating under the onslaughtof those who wish to stifle speech that disagrees with theirs. Truth is indanger of being extinguished, and it may fall to us who write to be the lastvanguard of free speech. That is why writers such as Bukowski need to bepublished and need to be read by establishment presses and before they’re dead.There are some of us who feel we are plunging back into a Dark Age. Historywould confirm that to be so. After nearly every period of enlightenment,anarchy prevails again for awhile, and this is what I see us heading toward, asa nation and as a world.            Itis the nature of groups to want to stifle opposing viewpoints. In this country,supposedly the land of free speech, attempts at suppression have been with ussince the adoption of the First Amendment, but the preponderance of that typeof activity has been traditionally borne by extremists of the far right and farleft political and societal spectrum. Those with the hot fire of righteousnessin their bellies have been the usual standard-bearers for the termination ofideas contrary to their agenda and such should probably be expected.            GordonWeaver told me that although he dislikes boorish and bigoted expressions, hesees a greater danger in disallowing their spokesmen an opportunity to beheard.            “Thecensors will always be with us,” he said. “It is the nature of bothinstitutions and individuals to desire the silence of those they wish tosuppress. Institutions with political power or ambitions for same (government,churches, schools) can probably be fended off--as they have been in moderntimes at least--by organized responses. The American Civil Liberties Union hasa pretty good record in this regard. Simple crackpots (racists, militantfeminists, and other self-appointed arbiters of community morality) seem towither away if studiously ignored.”            Repression comes in many forms, notalways overt. Kathleen M. Sullivan, a professor of law at Harvard Law School,in talking about the censorship issue as it affects funding for the NEA, saysof the PC issue, “An artist who receives a check in the mail (from the NEA)with a ‘hit list’ of forbidden ideas attached will forego too much valuable andinnovative expression for fear it will come too close to the line. As (USSupreme Court) Justice Thurgood Marshall once put it, the problem with a ‘swordof Damocles is that it hangs--notthat it drops.’”            Fred Grandy, former actor on the Love Boat and now a Congressman from Iowa, says, “I am noartist and have 10 years on TV to prove it. But I have spent enough of my lifearound creative minds to know that you cannot have art without risk. You cannotwrite language proscribing the human imagination that will not turn artists awayin droves.”            Speaking of Congress in terms thatcould be applied to college professors and publishers as well, Grandy said,“Trying to eliminate smut by allowing Congress to tell America what isand is not artistic is as misguided as attempting to legislate patriotism byamending the Constitution to prohibit flag burning.”            And publishers. How do they, asdeciders of what news is fit to print, view the censorship debate? Reactionsrange from the moderately perplexed to the horrified doomsayers.            Robert McDowell, who publishes theStory Line Press, wrote an opinion piece for the Register-Guard in Eugene, Oregon,which perhaps synopsizes the publisher’s view. “The debate pits a democraticmajority believing in our First Amendment rights of free speech against awell-financed and well-organized minority extolling the virtues of all that iswholesome and the government’s right to control the subject matter of the bookswe read, the music we enjoy, the paintings and plays we experience.” McDowellcalls Senator Jesse Helms and other individuals and groups’ efforts to censormaterials funded by the NEA, “the most severe legalized censorship in thiscountry since the McCarthy era,” and labels such censorship efforts as being“shameful attacks on free speech and the artist’s right to represent the truthas he or she perceives it.”            Pulitzer-Prize-winning novelist,Larry McMurtry, in a Washington Post article, accused the Jesse Helms-ledforces of attempting to “eliminate all sex from American art if they can.Rembrandt’s sketch of a fully clothed heterosexual couple attempting themissionary position behind a bush would likely not be thought fund-worthy byHelms, whose stated preferences would limit us to snow scenes, pictures of birddogs or romantic landscapes involving, if possible, humble tobacco farms.”McMurtry goes on, “The narrative as these individuals see it, in theirdetermination to tell Americans what they need and don’t need in the way ofpublicly funded art, is rigidly chaste: no public money for anything with sexin it! (They may claim that (they) only want to withhold public money from artthat depicts or describes ‘wrong’ sex-- i.e., homeoerotic (no grants toLeonardo or Proust!) sadomasochistic (no Westerns, no film noir), exploitive ofchildren (no Lolita, no Lewis Carroll), but it’s clear that they really mean toeliminate all sex from American art if they can.”            Kathleen Sullivan puts it even moresuccinctly, when she says, “A free society can have no official orthodoxy inart any more than in religion or politics. And in a free society, suchorthodoxy can no more be purchased by power of the purse than compelled bypower of the sword.”            Just a couple of years ago, StanleyBanks, Kansas Cityplaywright and poet, offered the balance of such cost: “We will begin to seedull art which has no freshness of vision. Certain points of view will besilenced. When that happens our society will be seriously threatened without abomb being blasted.” He warns us not to “call for laws to censor artists whochallenge our consciousness in ways that might be uncomfortable, irritating,risqué, etc. For those who don’t want to see or hear or read about acts orpoints of view contrary to their own, he advises, “simply don’t look, buy it orlet the kids have access to it!”            Banks’ “dull art which has nofreshness of vision” is already upon us. It has always been with us, sincecensorship in one form or another has always been around--it has only increasedmightily in the past few years. The result is art which is becoming blander andblander, much resembling the “art” that was allowed to surface in totalitariangovernments such as the USSRof a few years past and in many other governments. America is not yet at that stage,but if current developments continue in publishing, in the university, and ingovernment, we are not far from achieving total censorship, imposed by thegroup in control.            Whatscares me the most is that universities should be the bastion of free thoughtbut the state of the matter is that free debate of ideas is rapidlydisappearing from the college campus. As more and more writers come out ofuniversity settings and are being influenced by teachers with a decidedpolitical bent, the writing they produce becomes more and more insipid. Thesesame writers take over the litmags and editor positions at publishing housesand impose their political beliefs on those who submit, publishing only thosethat can pass the PC test in the content of their creative material. As KurtVonnegut said in a quote cited earlier, “Literature should not disappear up itsown asshole, so to speak.” Well, it’s in great danger of doing just that. It’sabout halfway up the anus.            Ininterviewing folks for an article I wrote on censorship for Circle K Magazine, I was referred to thebrother-in-law of a friend of mine, an Australian, who was teaching physics anddoing research at one of America’s leading universities which I cannot namebecause I’ve promised him anonymity. This man says, “I think it’s a myth thatcensorship doesn’t exist on college campuses. I believe universities should beplaces where anybody can say whatever they want and everybody should be verytolerant, but it’s just not true. Students are punished for saying certainthings. You could say whatever you wanted at the University of Sydney (wherehe’s from). They were much more tolerant there. In student publications therewas much less concern about libel, for example. The litigation aspect puts alot of pressure on what ideas you can express.” This man only agreed to give mehis views when I swore several times I wouldn’t use his name or even tell whatuniversity he was at, for fear of losing his job. It’s a sad day when a personfrom another country is allowed a greater freedom of expression there than inhis adopted country which professes to be the freest nation on earth.            Thisprofessor went on to say, “I think there’s more of a tradition inEuropean-style universities for freedom of speech--that that’s whatuniversities are for. In America, the impression I get is that universities arefor other purposes...for training professionals and for football games. It’snot about intellectual freedom. You pay us (educators) your money and you wantsomething at the end. You want a guaranteed elite job in society, and it hasnothing to do with expanding your mind. You’re buying a product. It’s more of aconsumer orientation.”            Headds, “The government is trying to censor more and more science that they areactually paying for. For example, on sensitive subjects as global warming, the governmentwants to see research results first, because of the possible politicalconsequences.”            Americansshould be ashamed when they have prided themselves on theirs being the leadingexample of a free society, when others in the world community may be seeing usvery differently, as evidenced by my anonymous critic and source.            Anita Manning, writing for USAToday, says that the issue is different in colleges than it is in the lowerlevels of education.            “In K through 12, there is a schoolboard or some sort of governing body that chooses what books are included inthe curriculum...whereas in the college setting, the individual professor orinstructor chooses the books for that course and students choose whether or notto take the course, leading to entire different issues.”            In June, 1992, Brenda Suderman,acting media relations officer for The Bulletin, the student newspaper at the University of Manitoba in Winnipeg, reported that the universitydeleted about 170 files containing material on sexual bondage and pornographyfrom the Internet computer system the university subscribes to. Gerry Miller,Director of Computer Services, made the decision in consultation with TerryFalconer, Vice-President (administration), saying the material was removedbecause “we felt they (the deleted files) didn’t support the mission of theuniversity and we felt they were objectionable.”            Alisa Smith, co-editor of TheMarlet, the student newspaper at the University of Victoria in British Columbia,published what university officials deemed objectionable material as exampledby a lesbian, gay, bisexual issue put out in 1991 which featured male andfemale genitalia on the cover. About 2,000 copies were thrown into dumpsters bycampus traffic and security functionaries upon administrative order. Even so,Smith feels the press is becoming a bit freer. (Yeah, well--go figure…)            She says, “The mainstream media iscovering a lot of issues that only the alternative press used to cover. Isuppose the backlash against political correctness is sort of an attemptedcensorship, like trying to silence people, but not by directly shutting downtheir newspapers. (Universities) are trying to shut down thought, rather than newspapers. All the articles that you see areabout how PC’s have sort of gotten a grip on society and how people can’t saywhat they want anymore. I guess it’s like a left-wing phenomenon.”            Let money talk, though, andcensorship takes on yet another clever form: the economic kind.            “Personally,” says Smith, “I thinkthe biggest form of censorship right now is the fact that the economy is sobad, making advertising really hard to come by. A lot of papers used to have afairly idealistic boycott list for advertising that they wouldn’t use becauseof things those advertisers were funding--like nuclear systems contracting orbecause they were pro-apartheid in South Africa. Editors are findingthey can’t make ideological choices any more because of monetary pressure. Ifyou’re really dependent on advertising dollars, you have to basically write thekinds of things that won’t offend your advertisers and don’t disagree withtheir stances.”            This latter statement seems tocontrast with her earlier one that “the press is becoming a bit freer,” and isperhaps a good example of why censorship is unnecessary. If you allow anyone totalk freely long enough, they may provide sufficient evidence by their ownwords that they should not be taken that seriously when giving us the benefitof their opinion.            Fearful of bad publicity duringstressful economic times, it is not so surprising college and universityadministrations are increasingly acting to suppress anything that might bringadverse publicity to their campuses. What is surprising is that faculty membersare increasingly joining in, even in the supercharged Politically Correctenvironment that has permeated most higher-education campuses in one way oranother.            A 1992 incident at Nicholls State University in Thibodaux, Louisiana,exemplifies the debate and poses difficult and perplexing arguments for bothsides of the issue.            A cartoon ran in the studentnewspaper, the Nicholls Worth, poking fun at three black singers in a rap groupthat had performed on campus. Black students who were offended, protested byburning about 150 copies of the paper publicly. Their complaint was that theywere greatly upset by the exaggerated features of the cartoon figures and thestereotypes it reinforced. Eric Knott, president of a black fraternity deniedthat the protest had anything to do with being politically correct.            “I’m not one to hide behind racismand claim that everything in society is racist, (but) the cartoon clearlydegraded the black race,” Knott says.            Marty Authement, student editor ofthe paper, said that he “used poor judgment” in allowing the cartoon to bepublished, but was also concerned that “political correctness is limiting whatjournalists can do. These days you have to be more sensitive than you usuallywould be. If you live by the strict law of political correctness, there’s notmuch left.”            I had a very jarring and dismayingexperience with PCism with my own novel TheDeath of Tarpons. A few years before it actually got published, a regionalpublisher in the Southwest wanted to buy it. A very few months before thisoffer, I was sleeping on a garage floor in California and eating out of a Bob’sBig Boy dumpster, so the money he offered had the same value as a milliondollars to me. I almost signed the contract until the publisher said, “Well, wehave to change a lot of this. There’s stuff in here that might make certainfolks upset.” He gave as an example a scene in which the boy’s father whips himwith a live king snake. This might offend the snake lovers, he said. That’s gotto be what?--seven or eight in the U.S.A.? Not counting, of course,the folks who use them in church services. He cited about twenty other scenesI’d have to change because they might offend this person or that. Reluctantly,I withdrew the book, not knowing if it would ever be published, and indeed, itwas another five years before I found a publisher who wasn’t as concerned aboutsnake lovers’ feelings and was more concerned with putting out a book that shefelt had literary value.            Mind you, this was several yearsbefore the wholesale PC attitude took over the country. This asshole--and I don’t excuse myself from the term--wasmerely the forerunner of what is a terrifying fact of life today.            If you believe this to be theravings of a paranoid mind, consider these facts:            A record 348 incidents of attemptedcensorship occurred in the 1991-92 school year, according to The American Way,a liberal watchdog group. That’s an increase of 20% over the previous high, afigure they claim poses an alarming advance in assaults on a basicConstitutional right--a right almost universally assured in most of the freeworld.            The Literary Network, a projectjointly administered by Poets&Writers, Inc. and the Council of LiteraryMagazines and Presses report over 6,000 attempts to remove books from shelvesin American libraries in the 1980’s and ‘the number of incidents is noticeablyon the rise.”            Concerned Women for America, aconservative, pro-family group asserts all censorship attempts are notnecessarily bad. Caia Mockaitis, speaking for the organization, says the issueis one of selection, not censorship, many times, in that “there are somematerials that are appropriate for kids and some that are not,” no matter whatadults’ political bias, liberal or conservative.            Mockaitis has plenty of like-mindedsupporters. Censorship attempts at banning outright or restricting access tobooks and magazines in secondary school libraries were successful in nearlyone-half of instances between 1987 and 1990, reports a University of Wisconsinsurvey of 6,600 schools. Challenged publications were removed 26 percent of thetime, restricted by age or grade level 22 percent of the time, and more likelyto occur at small schools.            The book challenged most? JudyBlume’s Forever, a story of a teenagegirl who loses her virginity. Sports Illustrated’s swimsuit issue and RollingStone were the most-challenged magazines at secondary schools, according to USAToday, Jan. 20, 1992.            Consider this item: “PornographyVictims Compensation Act” was a bill on the U.S. Senate floor that would enablevictims of sex crimes to file civil suits in an effort to recover damages fromproducers and distributors of obscene materials (including publishers,wholesalers, and booksellers) if the victims can show that the materials“caused” the crimes. This “third-party liability” bill is a way of imposingcensorship through a back door. This item was reported by the AmericanBooksellers Association.            Here’s another: In May, 1990, FerrisAlexander, operator of a chain of bookstores, theaters and video stores in the Minneapolis area, wasfound guilty of violating the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organization Act(RICO) obscenity forfeiture law. His crime? Selling four magazines and threevideotapes found to be obscene and valued at less than $200. Alexander wassentenced to six years in prison, fined $200,000 and forfeited a $25 milliondollar business. This was reported by The Media Coalition.            Here’s another. Three editors of theOhio State Universitystudent newspaper, The Lantern,resign when members of the journalism faculty issue a policy statement that thefaculty advisor had the authority to review articles for libel before they werepublished. This story from The Chronicleof Higher Education, March 4, 1992.            Censorship is everywhere and risingin attempts and more frightening, in successful attempts.            Free speech advocate Nat Hentoff,the author of Free Speech for Me - ButNot for Thee: How the American Left and Right Relentlessly Censor Each Otherfrom HarperCollins, feels that in too many cases, publishers, school boards andprincipals remove or change material for students rather than face the wrath ofmilitant parent groups. Seeing authorities suppress ideas in some cases, andbeing in a school in which books keep disappearing, gives a graphic lesson tostudents, Hentoff feels, in that they may have doubts that theirs is a countryof intellectual freedom.            And it appears it isspecial-interest groups that are behind these efforts and that the majority ofAmericans are against censorship. A survey conducted by Louis Harris for theAmerican Council for the Arts and sponsored by Phillip Morris Companies, Inc.,in February, 1992, polled 1,500 adults over the age of 18 by telephone. Part ofthe findings were that 91% felt it important for school children to be exposedto and participate in the arts; 67% felt learning about the arts as importantas learning about history and geography, 60% say as important as math andscience, and 53% believe the arts are important as learning to read and write.It’s evident that it’s a small but vocal and politically-powerful group ofminorities who are succeeding in censorship activities and these groups emergefrom both ends of the political and societal spectrum.            Virtuallyevery publisher in the country, from the smallest litmag to the largestpublishing conglomerate, is terrified of antagonizing any reader whatsoever,unless the person offended is not part of a highly-organized, highly-vocalpolitical group. This includes both right and left-wingers. It seems everybodyin America has now organized, has a group with a slogan, a newsletter, a homepage on the Internet, and a secret handshake. The battle is being waged overwho gets ultimate control of the presses. And it doesn’t matter who wins. Weall lose. What we lose is freedom of expression. And once that happens, we aredone as a free society. I go to Gordon Weaver once again, who said it as bestas it can be said. “Censorship from without is bad for the language, bad forthose who speak or write it; self-imposed censorship, whatever the motive is worse. If you won’t say what you think, yourun the risk of losing the powers of both speech and thought. I suspect we’llbe safe just as long as we refuse to accept censorship for anyone.”            Again,I quote Gordon Weaver for perhaps the best take on the situation. “If the kingis naked, we’re all (including the king) better served if someone says so.”            Well,the king is indeed, naked. The only problem is not enough of us are saying so,preferring to remain safe, keep our jobs, get our material published and so wego on, giving silent tacit agreement to what is happening. This is anunderstandable position for many in our society; it is unforgivable forwriters, at least in my opinion. Writers should be like the canaries in coalmines, the warning system that things are not right and that danger looms. As agroup, we have many of us become complacent, intent only on saving ourprofessional selves at the expense of freedom of thought. Maybe we understandtoo well that although the canary in the coal mine provided a valuable service,in doing so he ended up room temperature.            Icannot count the numbers of instances acquaintances of mine have said to me, “Icannot say certain things I believe in, to my class, my teachers, my peers, orin my writing, because I would lose my job or be censured or not see my work inprint, etc. What’s wrong with us? What kinds of writers are we producing inthis country that are fearful to take stands on issues they believe ferventlyabout simply because they risk disapproval? What kind of chickenshit writer isit that the little squiggles he or she puts down on paper consist ofhalf-truths and integrity that is compromised regularly? We are surrenderingsomething precious more by what we don’t do than what we do. Are we so enamoredof safety and comfort that we are willing to give up the freedom to expressourselves honestly? It seems that we are. It is a growing malaise that issweeping the country and I hold that the only ones that can stem the tide arethe writers in our society. But where are they?            Some are out there. There are a few.William Vollmann. Brian Everson. Michael Tolkin. Bukowski. There are othersthat we’ll never know of because they can’t find a forum. There need to be alot more such voices. What is really needed is for establishment forums tobegin looking more at the quality of the writing than the content. To give anear to voices that refuse to be influenced by a job, a smile from anempty-headed bureaucrat, publication in a white-bread magazine or by abottom-line mentality of a publishing conglomerate.            I think back to when I began writingas a grade school kid. One of the things I used to do was write humoroussketches of some of the more terrifying individuals I faced daily. Individualslike the bullies I and others faced, from the schoolyard rowdy to the teacherwho thought her job was to intimidate her class into submission. I’d show these“pieces” to friends, they’d be passed around, and in some cases, public opinionended those offenders’ bullying careers. Nobody likes to push someone around ifhe’s going to get laughed at by everyone else. It just plain takes all thepower out of it, not to mention the fun.            Theproblem today is, the bullies have taken over not only the schoolyard, but theuniversity, the Congress, and the publishing house. Many of us in this roombecame writers because of a bully somewhere in their past. Maybe it was anotherkid, or a group of kids, or maybe it was a parent or a teacher. We found wecould effectively combat these kinds of folks by the written word. If we werephysically weaker we possessed a strength that was virtually indefensibleagainst. The power of ideas, expressed upon the page and in open debate. Do wewant to give up our only weapon against tyranny? I hope not.            And by the way--those writers Imentioned at the beginning of this lecture--Whitman, Steinbeck, Faulkner,Thackery, Milton, Shakespeare, Melville, Alcott--and that I described as“safe”, were anything but that when they were being published. They were almostall rogues in their time and were, by turns, either censored, vilified, viewedwith shock, attacked by those in power, or even unpublished in their lifetimesbecause of the content of their writing. It is only after many years had passedand the political climate had shifted, that the original perceptions of themand their work were considered nonthreatening enough to exist in our librariesand schools. Although many of them are still censored, even today. Steinbeckroutinely makes his appearance at book-burnings and other censorship attempts,along with Faulkner, Whitman and even Shakespeare. They were “safe” to me whenI read them, simply because I was reading them in a different, more removedera, but in fact, those writers who have become what we call “immortal” havelargely been the risk-takers of their time, who wrote in line with theirconscience, rather than the political and social mores of their period. Many ofthem endured great distress because what they were writing was politically incorrectat the time. The thing was, there were then and still are now, publishers whogave them a forum, often at great risk, and there were those who read them, andso the world has been enriched through those individuals’ courage. Knowingthis, it would be easy to say, “well, hey, those folks got published and thereare those today being published who don’t parrot the party line, so what’s theproblem? The problem is, once we as writers and future editors and educatorsbegin to think like that, complacency sets in and we get the attitude to “letsomeone else worry about it” and that’s when our freedom of expression becomesseriously eroded and in danger of disappearing. Freedom of expression is avalue that must be continuously fought for, over and over. That war is neverfinished unless one side or the other lays down its arms. As part of thisgeneration of writers, it is our duty to take up the battle.            There is another point of view thatsays that it’s not the job of an artist to express a viewpoint or an opinion atall. While I respect the right of those who feel that way, I disagree. Indeed,is it possible to find a writer of note who hasn’t expressed his point-of-view,politically, through his or her writings? What else was Steinbeck commenting onin “The Grapes of Wrath” if not a political system? Perhaps he didn’t stand ona stump and proclaim to the world his political views but they sure are rightthere in his fiction. There are countless others I could give as examples andI’m sure you have your own list. Some artists feel it is their job to present avision of the world, not a political opinion. I don’t see a difference. Itseems to be a matter of semantics. What is a “vision of the world” except a political opinion? Or you mightcall such a view a “philosophy” but again, philosophies (in my opinion) arenothing but political ideologies dressed up in a tuxedo. I believe it all comesdown to politics and I mean politics in the purest sense, as in I want mine andyou want yours and I’d kill you for yours if we hadn’t agreed that we’recivilized and have figured out a way for both of us to keep our stuff and notworry about the other taking it. And, for me, that’s what censorship finallyboils down to. It’s refuting the principle that I can have mine and you can’ttake it and you can have yours and I can’t have it either. You can justsubstitute the word “opinion” for a particular possession. What I object to isthe closing down of forums for all but those who agree with the body politic,not in an overt way but by more subtle and insidious means.            Thank you for your time. I hope I’vegiven you some food for thought. I hope you’ll read some Charles Bukowski, someWilliam Vollmann. I don’t even care if you don’t like or agree with them. Infact, the only way this little talk will be a success if people go out of herearguing with each other. Personally, I’m like Robert Duvall in The Apocalypse Now - I love the smell ofa good argument in the morning. I’d like to leave you with one of my favoritequotes. In the preface to the infamous Storyof O, Jean Paulhan wrote, “Dangerous books are those that restore us to ournatural state of danger.”Thanks for reading.

I've been rather troubled by the suppression of free speech in our country. Some opinions are celebrated, while the opposite opinions are now socially and sometimes even legally punished.That is different frompeople choosing not to watch a movie or read a book because they don't like the content.It is also differentfrom publishers and studios choosing not to publish a film or book because they know people won't buy it. Most publishers are corporations, not charities. So we can't expect them to publish something people won't buy.Is that the opposite ofyour position, or does it somewhat make sense?Thanks for your time,AaronHi Aaron,Good points! The key tome in your argument below is the part that states: exerting such socialpressure on people who express uncomfortable  opinions that they do notfeel free or are not free to express their  views.This is the centralproblem, I feel. It's not the \"legally punishing or prohibiting free speech\"part that bothers me nearly as much as the social pressure. We're seeing thiseverywhere these days--from the so-called \"safe spaces\" collegeninnies yap about and serve more to suppress other's opinions than anythingelse. One of my books recently underwent this kind of \"censorship.\" Areviewer wrote a positive review of my novel \"The Bitch\" and when shewent to publish it in a number of newspapers, they would publish the review,but demanded to block out the word \"bitch\" not only in the title butin any occurrence within the review. Not what you'd legally or technically call\"censorship\" perhaps but it had the same, chilling effect. What'sreally funny, is that the title has absolutely nothing to do with a pejorativeterm against females (nor was it a term for a female dog), but, rather, it's acommon term used by both criminals and district attorneys to denote the\"three strikes and you're out, ha-BITCH-ual criminal statute\" ergo,\"the bitch.\" This is just one of those insidious and seeminglyrighteous forms of covert censorship. As is the atmosphere today on manycollege campuses where you are bombarded on all sides by liberal thought and ifyou express a conservative idea, you are routinely hooted down and worse. Thesame thing is operating in publishing circles. My own opinion is a pox on bothhouses. If I don't like what you write or what you say I have a choice--don'tlisten or don't buy your work. If it comes with a label supplied, I maintainthat already is influencing your decision to buy or not buy it and based on anarbitrary scheme of reasoning, by definition slanted.Blue skies,LesThat’s our conversation.

He asked me to thank all of the folks we may have reached. I know that like me, you're glad that his two little girls, his wife, and himself are going to be able to get off the streets! This is where social media shows its soul.Now, I have to brag on my son Mike a bit. Mike's kind of a Renaissance Man in that he's talented on many levels. When he was in grade school, he and his friends made a spoof movie on Saving Private Ryan, he retitled Saving Ryan's Privates, where he followed his friend Ryan around school with a movie camera, and every time he came close to a girl Mike and his buddy tackled him in a heroic effort to save their friend's \"privates.\" In high school, he was a star pitcher who played on several outstanding travel teams all over the country and his h.s. team won the large school state title twice.On the mound for Snider H.S.On his uncle's Harley... And, as an 8th grade basketball player.Nowadays, Mike is the top salesman at the Rogers & Hollands' Jewelry Store in Ft. Wayne, and recently was awarded their top employee of the year from all 80 of their stores.In his spare time, Mike has always drawn really abstract forms and posted them on Instagram. Just recently, his work was discovered by a major art dealer who is going to present them in an exhibition and for sale. Won't name the gallery just yet until it's cleared to do so, but the owner is a well-regarded name in art circles. Anyway, I thought I'd post the images Mike sent to her which are being prepared for exhibition and sale. I think Mike got his art ability from me since I have none left, whereas his mother still has a lot. That only makes sense, right?Anyway, here's Mike's drawings:He has literally dozens and dozens and dozens of these as well as \"regular\" artwork. I'm really proud of him and this may mean the dawn of a new career for him. Hope you enjoy the look at his weird mind... That, I know he got from dad...Not to mention his sister, Sienna is an extremely good artist as well. His other sister, Britney, is the outlier as she's a computer guru... We can't point to any parent for where she got those skills... not from me, anyway! But, we do know she got her brains from her mother since I still have all of mine...In case you can't tell, I'm so damned proud of all of my kids!Blue skies,Les"},
{"title": "Help out Craig and his family!", "date": "Monday, October 19, 2015", "text": "Hi folks,A fellow writer and editor has recently fallen upon hard times and I'd like to ask those who can to help him and his family out. Craig McNeely and his family are homeless in New Orleans. I've been homeless there, but with a difference--I was by myself. I can't begin to imagine how it would have been if my family had also been there and in that situation.Last Tuesday they lost their home and Craig and his two little girls and wife headed to New Orleans. He's there now and homeless and needs our help. Craig has been a friend to me and to many, many writers over the years. He is truly one of the \"good guys\" in writing and really needs our help. If you can, please visit the GoFundMe site and give what you can. https://www.gofundme.com/mcneelyfamilyBelow is Craig's message on GoFundMe.Hello, My name is Craig McNeely. With my wife Emily, I publish the quarterly pulp magDark Corners and run the small press Double Life Press. You can see us up therewith our two incredible kids.In July of last year, the bottom dropped out on our financial situation. Wewere looking at losing our car and eviction after Emily's ex-husband skippedout on child support, and in the same month, the federal government decidedthat I was making too much money, even though I'm permanently disabled, nowthat I'm married, and dropped my SSI from $710 to $230. That's $1,100 we lostin a single month.The following month, we lost our car and our cell phones, had our water and gasshut off, and were nearly evicted, if not for the assistance of a local churchto keep a roof over our kids' heads. Still, we recovered. OCSE got involved andchild support was reinstated, and we were able to get food stamp assistance.It's not easy for a family of four, including two small children and a husbandin a wheelchair, in a rural town in America, but we were making it okay.However, things have become far more complicated this year. In July of thisyear, I suffered significant health-related setbacks because of my SpinaBifida, leading to several visits with doctors, and I'm now largely wheelchairbound. Since we live in such a rural area, medical specialists can sometimes bevery far away, making it essentially impossible if you do not have access totransportation.In addition, government regulations changed again, as they do, and we lost foodassistance.So, we are looking for help. Specifically, we want assistance toward getting acar. This will help me when I require medical attention, as is so often thecase when you live with something like Spina Bifida. Transportation meansopportunity. It means physical therapy for myself. It means not walking orwheeling to the grocery store and only being able to buy what we can carry backhome. Anything that doesn't go toward getting transportation will provide food andclothing for our children, and mobility and therapy aides (like a fitnesswheelchair or orthopedic shoes).Early on, I mentioned our magazine and press. Yes, Emily and I are book people.I suspect that's how many of you know us. Well, we are putting together abenefit anthology full of great and fun stories by many of the best writersI've ever known: James Reasoner, Stephen Mertz, Les Edgerton, Will Viharo. RyanSayles, Eric Beetner and more, with cover art by Chuck Regan.Every contributor to this campaign will receive a digital copy of the anthologyat the beginning of October. Also, if you would rather just purchase apaperback of the anthology, you can wait for its release and support us thatway. Either way, we thank you from the bottom of our hearts for your supportand generosity. If books or cash donations are not your thing, Emily runs a small Etsystore  with handcrafted textile art pieces with a geeky twist. Headover there, check it out, and any purchases you make will also go toward ourcampaign.Once again, thank you for all of your help. Craig McNeelyUs writers are among the most generous of any group--I know we're going to come together and help out our brother!

{"title": "BOUCHERCON REDUX", "date": "Tuesday, October 13, 2015", "text": "Hifolks,Well,here it is… time to post my after-Bouchercon notes.I’mfairly rested now after returning home to face over 600 emails waiting… When I’mat a convention like this the same thing always happens. I just can’t find thetime to sit at the computer and go through emails. And, the first day I hadtrouble connecting with the hotel wi-fi, so lost time there. My roommate andbest buddy, Jack Getze finally had to show me how to use a ‘puter… not thefirst time Jack’s come to my assistance.My buddy, Jack Getze! Also, my hero!I broughtmy remote-control fart machine to plague him and it worked well. I didn’trealize it would go off intermittently and I found out the next day that itkept going off all night and I slept like a baby, not knowing Jack wassearching everywhere for it. He said he intended to bash it to pieces, but hefinally found it and discovered there was a turn-off switch and kindly used itrather than destroying it.Thefirst night, Jack and our friend Kate Laity (known as Absolute Kate and she is…absolute…) had dinner at the next-door Greek restaurant and I kept setting itoff whenever the waitress happened by him. She just averted her eyes while Jack’sblood pressure rose—at least, I think that’s what made his face turn red.Me, Jack, and the indomitable Absolute Kate! Jack, me, and Christy Campbell, the wife of one of my publishers, Eric Campbell.Wefound out we’d made a mistake by getting our room at the Holiday Inn, thinkingit was close by the convention, but as it turned out, it was eight blocks away,so we single-handedly brought the taxi industry out of the depression and madea lot of cabbies rich. And, ourselves poor… It turns out they have theserickshaws and Jack took one of those back to our hotel one night. I had to lethim know how lame that was—the rich gaijin being towed around by the starving…well, you get the picture… Our room was fine except for the bathroom, which wassmaller than my cell back in Pendleton. I don’t think I’ve ever seen a johnthat tiny. My feet had to stick out halfway into the hall to fit on the stool…But, the view was gorgeous. We were on the 19th floor, just onefloor short of the top which was where the bar and restaurant were. Easy enoughto get there! They’re getting better with B-Cons—in Albany, it was a disaster,mostly because there wasn’t a bar at the convention center. Didn’t they know wewere writers and not evangelicals or the annual meeting of the Carrie NationSociety? We need BOOZE! It’s where all the business takes place. Next year, it’llbe in New Orleans and I don’t foresee any problems at all. Except, I don’t knowif I can go. I’m going to have to check to make sure there are no outstandingwarrants…I’mjust going to go over the highlights (for me) and that way I won’t feelobligated to name all the many great writers I got to chat and/or drink with. Ihate doing that because I always forget somebody I should have mentioned andthen I feel terrible. I’ll name a lot but not nearly all. There was a bunch ofhighlights and only one lowlight—I didn’t get to see the Notre Dame-Navyballgame! (But, they won!) Hard to imagine since I wasn’t on hand to cheer themthrough the tough spots, but somehow they did it without my usual assistance.Thefirst day I got to participate in a panel and that was just a terrificexperience. It was titled “Rough, tough tales for tough readers” or somethinginane like that. Our moderator, Eric Beetner, confessed he felt the same asmost of us did—that we didn’t have a clue what that meant and so we’d just yakabout anything at all… which is pretty much what we did. A great crew and weended up having a great time and the audience told us the same thing they toldevery other panel they visited—that we were the best! We think so, too. Just abunch of truly fantastic writers. Besides Eric, we had Trey Barker, Tom Young,Chris Pavone and moi.Here we are... a bunch of gangstas...We're just talking about blood and guts and Mom's apple pie...Thatevening Jack and I were to be interviewed by Tom Pitts on the radio show,Authors on the Air, and the hostess of that show, Pam Stack, even came up fromFlorida to be on the set and to make sure we didn’t steal the equipment. As ithappened, it was more than just us. About fifteen other writers crowded intothe room and it was a blast! I don’t know how Tom Pitts does it, but he knowshow to keep a bunch of balls in the air at the same time. Meeting the host of theseries, Pam Stack, was a highlight of my trip. If you didn’t get a chance tohear it, click on this to do so: http://www.blogtalkradio.com/authorsontheair/2015/10/10/live-from-bouchercon-skid-row-chatter-with-tom-pitts-and-the-noir-writersTom Pitts who emceed our radio show and is also one of my publishers. Look for BOMB! coming out soon from Gutter Books.A room full of writers!I get a question and I'm armed... if you don't believe me, look--I've got my cigarettes and my Jack... That's Pam sitting behind me and you can't see her shepherd's crook she uses to yank us from the stage...Oneof the highlights of the convention for me was getting the opportunity to sitand chat with Allan Guthrie for a long time. He was being honored at Boucherconas the International Guest of Honor. Al had approached me about a month agoabout participating in a project (which I can’t talk about as of yet), and wegot a chance to firm up our discussion on it and begin to move forward.Probably the most valuable time I spent! Plus, he’s just a really terrific guy.For a superstar of international acclaim, he’s just like your buddy down at thebar on a Saturday night. Your buddy who drinks tea...Had breakfast on Saturday with Ro Cuzon, who's not only one of my favorite writers, but favorite pals. We have similar backgrounds so our conversations are full of shortcuts for things you might have to explain to straights. (BTW, \"straights\" is what outlaws refer to regular citizens...) He brought me up to date on current New Orleans and I told him stories about the old days there. Great time! The morning before, Jack and I ate breakfast with Patti Abbott and her husband, Phil and that was really cool.Later, at the bar, I hung out with Mike McCrary who introduced me to Bruce DeSilva, of whom I'm a big fan. All through the convention, I got to schmooze with Kate Laity who always makes me laugh. Thenext night, I was privileged to participate in the Noir @ the Bar that ErykPruitt organized and hosted at Common 414, a great bar next to the Marriott. I’vetaken part in some truly great Noir@Bar venues before with Jed Ayres and C.J.Edwards, but this was the gala event of all. Got to hear and meet some of thebest noir writers on the planet!All of these folks--Jed Ayres, Eric Beetner, Joe Clifford, Jen Conley, Christa Faust, Ed Kurtz, Steve Lauden, Tom PItts, Tom Pluck, and Johnny Shaw are, to me, the creme de la crme of noir writers. Very honored to get to participate.I didn't know they attended, but wish I had known that David Hale Smith, Bryon Quartermous and some others were there as I really wanted to meet them.Here we all are for the group shot. Lotta warrants out for this bunch...I'm up!Got to see and renew friendships with Travis Richardson, Scott Alderberg, Rob Brunet, John Gilstrap, Reavis Worthan, Dana and Corky King, Nik Korpon, Steve Weddle, Mike Dennis, Chris Irvin, Con Lehane, Terrennce and Rita McCauley, Jenny Milchman, Brian Panowich, Peter Rozovsky, Charles Salzberg, Scotty Montgomery and a bunch of others--sorry if I missed naming you!And, I did it again. Acted like Doofus Fanboy. Saw Joe Finder (I'm a HUGE fan!), and went over and briefly introduced myself. That was it. Didn't do anything memorable like pick his pocket or fart loudly, which I now regret... He'll never remember me now... Wanted to meet in person Bill Crider, Reed Farrel Coleman, Libby Fisher Hellmann, Tom Franklin, and Steve Hamilton (who wrote one of my three all-time favorite books, The Lock Artist.One night, Jack and I closed down the Holiday Inn bar and while there met a fantastic writer who was just sitting quietly by himself, working on his next book, and now I've got another new friend--Jonathan Moore, who lives in Hawaii and wasn't impressed with the North Carolina weather. Wonder why not?Met a fellow Texan who grew up close to me in Freeport, Texas in Brazoria--Ricky Bush. Lots of us Texans there! Missed seeing my friend Robert Lewis--bummer! OnSunday morning, I dragged myself over to see my buddy Jack Getze moderate apanel and I’m glad I did. It was a primo panel and I got to meet a few more ofmy heroes I only knew from their books. Plus, Jack is a whiz at this emceeingstuff! Come to think of it, Jack’s a whiz at just about everything… includingwhizzing… He can write his name in the snow in fourteen languages…I got lucky going to the airport, getting to share the shuttle with Jack Bludis, who I've been reading forever. Had a great conversation with him.  I’dlike to name every person I met, talked to, drank with, all those things, but thatlist would take forever to compile and I know I’d leave someone out. So, if anyof you people read this, please don’t feel bad that I didn’t throw your nameout—just know that I value our friendship, new or old, and that I’m so glad wegot to spend some time together. I'll just show some photos and a lot of you will be in those.Can’twait until next year in New Orleans!Blueskies,LesAnd, here are some random shots...Pam Stack, Joe Clifford, Tom Pitts and me in the background.This was a great surprise! My buddy, Robin Deffendall, who runs the library at Fayetteville, N.C. who had me in to do workshops and yak last spring, showed up to experience B-Con. She's holding up (holding up is just a saying...) her list of five banned books for Banned Books Week... and my novel The Bitch made the list! Better than the National Book Award!D.B. Corey and me at the bar...Eric Campbell, me and J.L. Abrama, one of my favorite writers!Uh-oh... that's not  blood on my cheek... might be better if it was... The moderator at Noir at the Bar, Tracy Coppedge, drew a heart in lipstick on me and this is how it ended up...Toasting Debi Chowdhury at the Marriott bar...Me and Tracy Coppedge, the MC at Eryk Pruitt's Noir at the Bar.Tracy and me after I read...And, nothing to do with B-Con but just a birthday gift from my friend Michelle McCarthy that I really liked!And, then, I got to come home to my gorgeous wife, Mary! Best part of the trip!Blue skies, Les"},

{"title": "BURN THE BOATS!", "date": "Friday, September 18, 2015", "text": "BURN THE BOATS!Hifolks,Thisis going to be a post that some will like—most likely a minority—and some willdismiss or even hate—most likely a majority. Which suits me just fine. I’m acontrarian and I like being in the minority.I’ma lifelong Notre Dame football fan. I’m relishing the Showtime series currentlyplaying each week, focusing on Irish football. This week really registered withme big-time. As is his custom, Coach Brian Kelly brought in a motivationalspeaker, this week that person being Joe Plumeri, the CEO of City Group for 32years. What he had to say gave me chills. It spoke directly to my own personalphilosophy that I’ve lived under almost my entire life.(Ifyou want to watch it, here’s the link.) http://xfinitytv.comcast.net/watch/A-Season-With-Notre-Dame-Football/6837476258415459112/526228035751/A-Season-With-Notre-Dame-Football/videosSinceI was five years old, I’ve been committed to being a writer. Not for a secondhave I ever envisioned any other calling. Never under the worst circumstances Ifound myself in have I ever wavered from the goal of being a writer.Ididn’t know there was a rallying cry for this mindset—this philosophy. Now Ido.BURNTHE BOATS!Thiswas the message Mr. Plumeri delivered to the football team.Whenhe began talking to the team, he asked them: Are you  willing to do whatever you gotta do to win anational championship?” In unison, they all nodded emphatically that they were.He then said, “You nod your heads—it’s easy.” He then asked if they knew whothe Vikings were and then related their philosophy. “The Vikings were the conquerorsfrom the north. When the Vikings landed, the very first thing they did was theyburned their boats. Why do you think they burned their boats? They can’t gethome. They burned their boats because they were committed to win. To win.“Theydidn’t say, ‘well, we landed. We’ll win.. well, maybe we’ll win.’ That’s not commitment.You gotta ask each other today—are we compelling enough to burn the boats? That’scommitment.”Thatinstantly became the team’s rallying cry and team and individual philosophy. Asprobable All-American Sheldon Day said, later on, “Burn the boats is so importantto us. It means to do anything and everything we can to get a win.” One of theteam captains, Joe Schmidt, reiterated the same sentiment: “That full commitmentand burning the boats is something we’re going to lean on all year.”And,in looking back on my own life, that’s always been my own committment as far aswriting is concerned. I burned the boats a long, long time ago and I continueto burn them.I’vewalked away from good jobs more than once, simply because it was taking up toomuch of my writing time and/or it was changing my goals into more material onesthan writing goals. I’ve left relationships with terrific women for the samereasons. Married to a person who resented the time I spent writing. It’s whatWilliam Faulkner meant when he said, “An Ode On a Grecian Urn is worth any numberof old ladies.” It’s the mindset I’ve always, always had. Writing comes first.Always. I’ve never allowed anything to threaten that nor will I ever.And,much of society rejects such a philosophy. That’s all right. I’ve never trustedanything a majority of people are for. Almost always, it’s a compromise. And,if you want to be a writer, compromise is your enemy.Hasit cost me? Absolutely. But, whatever the cost was in each particular instance,it was simply worth that cost to achieve my goal.Severalyears ago, I had a man with whom I’d been working with on his novel, announceto me that he was quitting his very lucrative job as the manager of a largehotel, to pursue his writing full-time. He told me his wife was probably goingto divorce him as a result of that decision. At first, I wanted to grab him andtell him the common wisdom—“Don’t quit your day job, dude! Not until you’remaking a secure income from writing. The odds are against you, man.” I almostdid just that… but I didn’t. I could tell he felt the same as I did and who wasI to deter him from following his own dream? How could I, who’d done exactlythe same thing—several times—as he was proposing to do, tell him not to do so?I couldn’t. That wasn’t my place nor my job to do so. I’ve lost track of himand I don’t know if he ever realized his dream, but it doesn’t matter. For atleast one shining moment in his life, he was a Viking. And, people like thatare my heroes. I know what has to be given up and it’s considerable. So, evenif he didn’t make it as a writer, it doesn’t matter. He knows that he stoodtall, at least one time in his life, and that’s something that wealth or eventhe love of another person can never take away. I expect heated response andarguments on that statement and that’s fine. But, all the arguments in theworld won’t sway my own beliefs in what’s best for me.Thevast majority of those who want to be writers won’t achieve their dream. Ithink in at least some cases, it’s because they weren’t willing to burn theboats. I suspect it’s because a lot of folks want to have their cake and eat ittoo. They want to keep their job, concede to their wives’ or husbands' demands to employless time behind the computer, bow to other demands… and yet, to somehow crankout a publishable novel and gain riches and fame. To be fair, there are a greatmany writers who don’t burn their boats (or bridges) who do just fine. Theysell tons of books, have lots of fans, win all kinds of awards. And, that’sgreat. In fact, that’s ideal. But, for me, if I’d followed that path, I don’tthink I’d have become the writer I am. I would probably have become an author,but that isn’t the same as becoming a writer. Not the kind of writer I wantedto be and the kind I am. All in.There’sa reason the term “starving artist” is a well-known term that has roots inantiquity. I’ve more than once been that guy. And, may be again. So be it. I’veburned my boats and since I don’t know how to build one, that avenue is notpossible. That’s by choice. There have been many people who have burned their boatsand it didn’t work out as they wanted or even expected it to. That’s all right.They made a choice and they stuck by it. Even if they didn’t make it, they knowwhat it feels like to go out on that ledge by themselves and without a net, andyou can’t put a dollar value on that. It’s a priceless feeling. It’s freedom. It’sliving with your own rules and not those of others. When you do away with thepossibility of compromise, you’re free. You either learn to survive on yourown, or you don’t. It’s that simple.Thiswon’t be seen as the smartest philosophy in the world by most people. And, Isimply don’t care. It’s mine and I own it.Iwas a presenter at a writer’s conference in Indianapolis many years ago with awoman writer. At the end of our presentations, we held a Q&A, and the firstquestion we got was, “What if your husband doesn’t support your writing?” Towhich we both spoke in precise unison and without even looking at each other: “I’ddivorce him.” It was just the feeling we both had. We both felt the same—husbands(and wives, and boyfriends/girlfriends) are fairly easy to get. A book—a goodbook—is hard to get. Especially if you’ve got an enemy of that book in the sameroom with you. Actually, I’ve achieved Nirvana. I’ve been in severalrelationships that interfered with my writing and I severed them. My wife nowis the most supportive person I’ve ever known and I’m a very, very lucky guy.There aren’t many like her. Probably why we’ve been together for over a quarterof a century. Trust me—there aren’t very many out there like her.Idon’t expect many to understand how I feel and that’s fine. A person thatintensely dedicated to something in life is difficult to stomach for manypeople who don’t have anything that compelling in their own lives. I suspect it’sa threatening idea to many.Sobe it. As for me, I say only:BURNTHE BOATS!Blueskies,LesP.S. I just know this is going to piss someone off and who will want to take me to task...  That's fine--I'll be here all week--remember to tip your waiter or waitress.Here's a guy who burned his boats to follow his dream as a writer, for sure!

This person, who very graciously gave my novel,THE BITCH, a great review, emailed me to tell me that she was very sorry butthat the newspapers who regularly published her book reviews wouldn’t becauseof the word “bitch” in the title.Ifthis wasn’t so sad and even dangerous to our freedoms, it would be laughable.But, I can’t see anything humorous in it at all.First,the title—THE BITCH—isn’t employed here as the pejorative term commonly used to denigrate women.It’s not even the term when used to describe a female dog. It simply refers tothe term ex-cons use when describing the “three strikes and you’re out,ha-BITCH-ual criminal law” where an ex-felon, upon receiving a third felonyconviction can be sentenced for up to life imprisonment for that conviction.That’s it. It has nothing to do with women or dogs. It has everything to dowith our judicial system…It’sa title that perfectly describes the story. It’s about an ex-con with twoformer convictions who’s been put on the spot by a former cellmate to do him afavor—a favor he owes because the guy saved his life back in the joint—and onethat, if he’s caught doing it, will result in receiving life in prison,courtesy of “the bitch.” That’s it.Turnsout this word is on newspapers’ hit list of words they won’t print or publish.Except… that doesn’t seem to be entirely true. Daily, I get a list of articlesfrom Google for the words “the bitch” hoping to discover perhaps an article orreview of my novel I hadn’t seen. So far, haven’t been sent any for the novel—but,every single day I get a list of ten or more newspaper and other articles aboutrappers and rap songs and actors/actresses who use the words in songs and othermaterial, often calling each other by this term in catfights on HollywoodBoulevard. My take is that it’s only writers who are using the word in anentirely different context and a totally different meaning that get censored.Guess I shoulda been a rapper or an actress who calls another rapper or actressthis—that seems to be okay…I’dlike to send these newspaper geniuses and the rest of the nanny state personnela copy of George Carlin’s famous bit on words and also a copy of George Orwell’s“1984.” Although, I don’t think it would matter to any of them. I don’t thinkthey have the sense God gave a gnat to get in out of the rain. They certainlydon’t think much of freedom of thought or freedom of speech. That’s patentlyobvious, at least to me. If newspapers ever think about why nobody reads ‘emany more, I might have a clue for them…Iwonder if I wrote a book on female dogs and their care and training, how I’dtitle that? Sure don’t want the censors after me about my little tome on mycuddly book on Lassie and Timmy…Iwonder what other words are on their censorship lists. Do you suppose “bastard”might be on there? After all, that’s the companion word to “bitch” isn’t it?One’s male, the other’s usually applied to a female. How on earth did the book,BASTARD OUT OF CAROLINA ever get talked about in newspapers? Or… is itpossible, pejorative words about males aren’t seen to be as evil as those aboutfemales? Naw… that would make that a sexist thing wouldn’t it?Myfriend, Liam Sweeny, suggested I “change my cover, put a dog nursing herpuppies on it,” and I hope he was just trying to be funny. I’m pretty sure hewas—Liam doesn’t tolerate idiots any more than I do (sorry, is “idiots” abanned word? Probably… change that to “mentally challenged and prevented frompossessing common sense”…). Well, I told him there was no way I was caving inor catering to these morons—my exact words were, “Not changing a thing—fuck ‘em!”Idon’t know what I think I’ll accomplish by posting this. I’m just royally andfucking mad and deeply saddened by the PC idiocy that’s running rampantin our country and destroying the freedoms we used to cherish. Newspapers aresupposed to be one of our last bastions of freedom of thought and expressionand it’s obvious they’ve abdicated the last vestiges of this. If this doesn’tfrighten people I don’t know what ever will.So,I know that my novel won’t get any newspaper play. Hope you’ll read it and ifyou like it recommend it to a friend. Just be careful not to let the censorswho seem to be among us hear you… it’s for sure no newspaper is going topublicize any arrests by the Thought Police over this. They’d be forced to usethe title in the copy…MaybeI’ll get a rapper to rap about it and hold up a copy in the video…I’mgoing to protest by not buying a newspaper today. Oh, wait… I did thatyesterday. And yesterday and the day before that and… didn’t work then and probablywon’t work now…Whatdo y’all think about this? No big deal? Big deal? What would you do if ithappened to your book? Kowtow and avoid anything in your writing that might becontroversial? I don’t think that will happen to the writers I know… Maybe Ishould have cleared the title with Pravda? If anyone knows how to fightsomething like this, please let me know.Fuck‘em. Censor that, shitheads.Blueskies,Les"},
{"title": "ALLIGATORS AND CROCODILES ON TV", "date": "Sunday, August 9, 2015", "text": "THE INSIDE STORYON CROCODILES, ALLIGATORS AND THE TV GUYS WHO RASSLE ‘EMHifolks,Ifyou’re like me and are forced to stay indoors during the daytime and pretend tobe a writer, staring out the window at your neighbor’s above-ground pool allday begins to get a bit boring. So, I imagine you’re also like me and put a TVon a table in your writing room where you can look at it occasionally while youwhip out your next best-selling novel about meth-crazed minor criminals withhearts of gold.And,if you’re like me, you start noticing that besides things like the JerrySpringer Show, and CNN (which are basically the same show with differentsponsors), there are an awful lot of programs starring alligators andsteely-eyed men who search them out to wrestle.Oneof the things you may notice is that there are a lot less episodes these daysof Mr. Steve Irwin and a lot more of the Gator Boys. After watching a fewdozen episodes of each, it’s easy to see why. Besides the fact that Steve Irwinis no longer with us in the flesh, having shuffled off his mortal coil for theheavenly site of Crocodile Paradise (somewhere near Ayre's Rock).No,it’s because of something entirely different. If you’ll notice, much of the footageof Steve-O subduing crocodiles, took place at his zoo in Australia. They seemto be constantly moving the same alligator to another enclosed cement pond.This poor croc has accumulated more Frequent Mover miles than Hillary Clinton.He’s always being transported to somewhere else, usually because he’s beatingup his companion croc. You’d think after awhile, Steve and his crew would catchon that this guy is just plain anti-social and just put him in his own place,but no, every week or so, they find out he’s chewing up his pond mate so theyhave to gather the crew and a bunch of cameras and move him again.And,this is why his shows are shown less and less. The first thing he does, is letthe audience know just how ferocious these beasts are! Besides the usualwarning to “Don't try this at home” (which doesn’t apply to most of the audiencewho live in non-crocodile or alligator locales and many of those watching have I.Q.s higher than 43 so, while they may vote, they're not prone to rush out and hang a chokehold on a gator), he goes on at length to illustrate just howdeadly these beasts are. At this point in time, we’ve seen him feed roughly263,000 dead chickens to his crocs. It’s pretty much the same each time. Helets us all know that he’s about the only guy in history to ever dare get thisclose to these killers and then he stands at the edge of the pond and waves achicken at them. Eventually, they get curious about the guy waving the chickenand are probably hungry on top of it, and they scoot out and lunge at thechicken and snag onto it. Back in the water they go, until the 2:45 show. The fact that they have really short legs and can only lunge about eight inches and that usually tires 'em out, isn't often brought up.Wewere pretty well convinced that ol’ Steve-O was pretty much a man’s man, doingall this risky stuff and then this other show came on. The Gator Boys.Thisshow featured an alpha male and his portly sidekick with a safari hat.Recently, they’ve added a third to the crew, the portly sidekick’s portlygirlfriend. She’s the one without a hat.Ifyou have one of those TVs where you can show two shows side-by-side, take arepresentative clip from each show and play them simultaneously and you’ll soonsee why the Gator Boys and One Dudess have taken the glory away from Steve-O.WhenSteve gets ready to capture and remove the bad gator, he gathers his entirecrew of 23 people and they all gather around the gator. At his signal, they alljump on the poor creature, covering every square inch of his body so the poorcameraman has no shot of the animal itself and instead, is forced to provideshots of dozens of writhing arms and legs of folks who are smothering the poorgator who has to be wondering what he did to make so many people want to crushhim when all he wanted was a couple of drumsticks and a thigh and maybe a scoop of potato salad. All the whileguys are leaping onto parts of the gator, Steve-O is yelling about how dangerousall this is and directing each crew member to their six square inches they're to cover. His wife has taken part in the later episodes, and Steve is nomale chauvinist pig—not he. She gets to take part in the “capture” herself,usually by taping the croc’s mouth shut while fourteen of the crew hold hisjaws shut. Then, once bound by six hundred dollars worth of duct tapeand ropes, it takes all 23 of the crew to pick the animal up and carry it tothe fence and hoist it over. This feat takes great engineering skill tosupervise and all the while we’re told how extremely dangerous this beast is,even though he’s tied up like the Stockholm Syndrome poster girl and how onesingle misstep could mean certain death for… well, one of the 23 who doesn’tjump back quickly enough should he get loose and go after someone with hisbound mouth…Meanwhile,on your other screen, watch the Gator Boys Plus One Girl in action. The portlyone mostly stands on the shore of the lake or pond or swamp, his job to providecommentary on how dangerous all this is to the viewer and the ten-year-old daughterof the pond owner who has obviously been coached by the director to look afraid, but isn't that good of an actress and mostly giggles.Then,the alpha male shucks his clothes down to his bathing suit and just jumps intothe water with one of those sticks with a loop on the end that dog catchers useto snag runaway killer Pekineses with. He swims underwater (being filmed by adefenseless cameraman who doesn’t get enough props at all) until he locates thegator. This takes awhile, as the action keeps shifting back and forth fromunder the water to the portly guy on the bank who keeps watching alpha male’sbubbles and frets that his buddy may be in trouble since he’s been down there so long.(He never mentions the cameraman who’s been down there just as long and doesn't have a stick with a rope on it.)Eventually,though, alpha man makes his move, snags the gator and swims him to the edge,handing off the stick to his chunky friend, who then pulls him up. At thatpoint, they take turns walking around the animal to tire him out, and then oneof them jumps on him and the other one tapes his mouth shut. (The gator, notthe guy, although that's not a bad idea. Maybe tape the portly guy's mouth so we don't have to hear him telling his girlfriend for the 9,023rd time why she can't do this highly dangerous work just yet.) Then, one of them picks up the gator and walks him to the truck.Sometimes, if the animal is say 32 feet long, it’ll take both of them to pickhim up, but usually it’s a one-man job. The girl opens the tailgate.Thething is, though… they didn’t need 23 others to effect this capture. They onlyneeded two guys and a girl who keeps begging to let her in on the fun (whichthey never do because… well, you know… she’s a girl).Thething is, the Gator Boys have pretty much revealed that crocs and gators aren’tall that big of a deal to catch. It’s pretty clear it doesn’t require a team of23 beefy guys to do so.And,that’s why Steve-O’s show isn’t on that much these days.Ifully anticipate that in the next year or two, a new show will appear with aten-year-old girl who hunts gator armed only with a mouthful of Juicy Fruit gumand the mystical ability to sooth gators by patting them on the head—the first “GatorWhisperer.” Then, the Gator Boys Plus One Girl will be what we in the writinggame call… ancient history.We’llsee… Meanwhile, keep tuned as next week we’re going to reveal the real reasonmeth-head low-life criminals are appearing all over the place in bestsellingnovels. You won’t want to miss that!Or maybe we'll comment on the Turtle Man who also has a portly sidekick and an accent eerily similar to most of the pilots we've encountered on large planes.We'll go over exciting episodes wherein he grabs feisty racoons by their tails and threatens to turn 'em into hats for ten-year-old boys (who are the basic demographic of his audience). He is amassing a quiet fortune with all the apple pies and boxes of government cheese he's paid with.Blueskies,Les"},

{"title": "BLACK HEART MAGAZINE INTERVIEW", "date": "Tuesday, July 14, 2015", "text": "Hi folks,Here's an interview I was privileged to participate in with Laura Roberts for Black Heart Magazine.BlackHeart Magazine The Genuine, Imitation, Plastic Kidnapping: An interview with Les EdgertonFebruary16, 2015 · by LauraRoberts · in InterviewsLesEdgerton is the author of TheGenuine, Imitation, Plastic Kidnapping, a black comedy crime caperpublished by Down&Out Books – among many others. We recently had a chanceto ask him a few questions about his literary influences and inspirations, aswell as his advice on writing and life. Here’s what he had to say.Who are your top 5 favorite authors or influences?This is a tough one! I have literally dozens and dozens of favorite authorsand influences. I’ll try to narrow it down.Harry     CrewsAlbert     CamusElmore     LeonardCharles     BukowskiCormac     McCarthyWhat type of writing fuel do you prefer, and what – if anything – doyou feel this contributes to your creative process?I used to drink while writing—usually Jack Daniels—and then discovered thatthat feeling that liquor allowed me to write “better” was a totally falsefeeling and that the opposite happened. Nowadays, if I have a drink, I know I’mdone writing for the day. However, I drink prodigious amounts of coffee all daylong. Probably 9-10 cups a day and strong coffee. When I get coffee from acoffee shop, my choice is triple lattés.What inspired you to write your latest book?I have to have an idea gestate for many years before I write it. At anytime, I have up to ten novel ideas percolating. I know it’s time to write thebook when I begin dreaming about it asleep and thinking about it constantlywhile awake. While I’ve had a couple of books published after TheBitch, that was the last one I wrote and it was based on my prisonexperiences and that old “what if” question writers continually ask ourselves.The title doesn’t refer to a woman or a female dog—it’s the term we ex-cons usefor the federal law, the “three strikes and you’re out” ha-bitch-ualcriminal law, where the judge can give you up to life for a third felonyconviction. People sometimes don’t realize how a life can be ruined with justone wrong turn made from a place of loyalty, and that’s what happens to Jake.He delivers a favor he owes and things begin to go hinky quickly.Pirates or ninjas, and why?Not quite sure what ninjas are—some kind of oriental martial artists, right?Those ten guys all dressed in black who leap around fighting the good guy… oneat a time? Kind of dumb, it seems to me, so, I guess… pirates.Give us one piece of sage advice on writing, relationships, or lifein general.I’ll pass on the advice I gave my son Mike when he became a teenager on howto have a successful life: Never date a girl named after a day of the week, andnever play poker with a guy named after a city. Follow those two precepts andyou’ll probably have a smooth life. As far as writing advice, I’ll echo JimHarrison’s advice when he said if one hoped to become a good writer, they“should read the whole of Western literature for the past four hundred years…and if time permits, the same period of Eastern literature. For, if one doesn’tknow what passed for good in the past, they won’t know what passes for goodnow.” Pretty sound advice, methinks…If you were a cocktail, what would you be called, and what’s therecipe?Not a cocktail drinker, unless Jack and water is a cocktail and the recipeis in the name.If you were to pen the screenplay for the next summer blockbuster,what would it be about – and who would you want to see in the starring role?Actually, I have written the script that would accomplish that—my screenplayadapted from my novel, The Genuine, Imitation, Plastic Kidnapping—it’savailable, should some savvy producer want it… and the lead should be WoodyHarrelson.If you were to write an open letter to a famous author (living ordead), who would it be, and what would it say?It would be to Harry Crews and I’d just ask him to have drinks with me in abucket o’ blood somewhere and talk about anything he wants to.Where can we find you on a typical Friday night, and what kind oftrouble are you getting into there?Well, it would be at my desk writing. It’s where I spend virtually every dayand every night, seven days a week. My days of getting into trouble are behindme so… nothing to see here, folks—move along…What are you currently working on, and why does it kick ass?Just began a new novel along the lines of TheRapist, featuring the same protagonist. It’s not a sequel—more like acompanion novel. It kicks ass because it’ll make readers uncomfortable.Hopefully. I’ve been amazed for a long, long time about the question of God andeternity and mostly at how for millennia, we accept the sketchy and limitedidea of what heaven is, in our Western culture. For instance, in all theartist’s pictures and novels and books written, we just keep parroting thisreally insane physical picture of heaven. It seems to usually be fairlysparsely settled, for just one for instance. Well, if there is a heaven, we’vehad many, many billions of people live and die on earth, so it should beasshole to elbow crowded, right? For instance, if you were sitting there,surrounded by billions and billions of people, there would constantly be deadfolks arriving. Over here pops up a dead baby, over there twenty souls killedin a school shooting, over there a military unit wiped out by mortar fire, inyour lap two thousand victims of a plague… and so on. There would have toconstantly be a population in flux, with recently expired souls popping up allaround you. But, that kind of thing never seems to occur to those who describeheaven. Or hell. Same deal. I think our entire vision of what heaven and hellare are really twisted and it’s like no one’s ever challenged any of thisstuff. This novel will… I have literally hundreds of questions my protagonistwill pursue the answers to like this. I’m really excited about writing it and Ifully expect to go stark raving nuts when I finish it.Do you have any talismans, charms, superstitions or music thatinspires or helps you to write, and what’s the story behind them?No to most of those. However, I do use music often. In one of my craftbooks, I talk about that and give a list of a bunch of my stories where I namethe song I had playing while writing them. I think music is a very powerfulstimulus and use it often to evoke the tone and mood I want for the story. Iwrite mostly very dark fiction and C&W music—not the modern stuff, but theold-time C&W—can really create a dark mood. It’s mostly about cheatingwives and husbands, getting drunk and wrecking your car and dying, and aboutfighting, fornicating, and fooling people (the Three F’s…) and that’s all thestuff of fiction. Jazz is another great choice. I’ve written countless shortstories and at least a couple of novels with Miles Davis’ “Concierto deAjuarez” cut on his Sketches of Spain album. It’s a fantastic mood creator, atleast for me.What’s your exercise or sport of choice when getting out from behindthe desk?Being a professional writer, I very, very rarely get out from behind thedesk. Being in my seventies, the closest I get to sports is watching it on TV.I do often perform wrist curls with cans of Budweiser when I’m done writing forthe day. Does that count?For more from Les, find him on Facebook, Twitter, and check out his blog at lesedgertononwriting.blogspot.com."},

It crackles with manic energy andmad thrills. If you’re looking for a different kind of edgy crime novel, thisis the one to grab.” —Bill Crider, author of the Sheriff Dan Rhodes Mysteries“Les Edgertonserves up a gumbo of sexual deviants, small time hustlers, and seriouscriminals in a caper that reads like a deranged Damon Runyon tale relocatedfrom Broadway to the French Quarter. TheGenuine, Imitation, Plastic Kidnaping is not for the faint of heart, andthat’s just one of its selling points. If you like crime fiction that crackswise while offering a peek into the darker recesses, this is the book for you.”—Bill Fitzhugh, author of the best-selling novel Pest Control and TheExterminators“The most unrepentantlyfunny crime caper you’ll ever find between the pages of a book. Elmore Leonard,eat your heart out!” —Maegan Beaumont, author of Carved in Darkness“What makes this wild,wild tale so intriguing is the sense that it must be drawing onfirst-hand knowledge. Edgerton’s sympathetic tough guy narrator gives you anauthentic-feeling glimpse into the unique logic of small time hustlers and bornlosers, with echoes of Ring Lardner and snatches of slam poetry frequentlycatching you by surprise and making it that much more enjoyable.” —MatthewLouis, founding editor of Gutter Books and author of The Wrong Man and CollisionCocktail“Masquerading as anovel, Les Edgerton’s newest gem—TheGenuine, Imitation, Plastic Kidnapping—is really a debauched weekend insteamy New Orleans, loaded with alcohol, drugs, whores, pistols, and a menacingbookie, all available for your personal and private entertainment between thecovers. Narrator Pete Halliday—ex-con, gambler, boozer, ex-baseball pitcher andunwise wiseass—takes us places most don’t really want to go, only to have thetime of our lives when we get there. Listen to him: ‘Coming into New Orleans,you could smell it. First day out of jail after thirty days, you could reallysmell it. Hot and sexy, a couple hundred thousand red hot little mamas,stepping out of steamy baths and showers, their skin sticky from the heat,getting ready for Saturday night...’ Every pitch Pete throws is a hair-raisingthrill, a belly laugh or a clue to the wicked and violent puzzle that hangsover his New Orleans adventure. You know someone has to die.” —Jack Getze,Fiction Editor, Spinetingler Magazine“There are twocertainties when reading anything written by Les Edgerton. First you’ll getgritty, hard hitting noir straight out the top drawer that’ll leave you punchdrunk on the floor. Second is it’ll be like nothing you’ve ever picked upbefore. The Genuine, Imitation, PlasticKidnapping is no exception. Expect the unexpected. Read it, love it.”PeteHalliday’s gambling addiction costs him dear – his baseball career is over. SoHalliday heads to New Orleans to find his fortune, hustling. But five yearslater he’s failed again and is in debt to a bookie and in deep with TommyLeClerc, a man with a pool of luck as shallow as Halliday’s.LeClerc comes up with another can’t lose scam, tokidnap the Cajun Mafia King and hold him for ransom. To demonstrate they’reserious LeClerc says the King’s amputated hand will be the proof they need toget a sack of cash. Halliday wants out of the seamier side of life so he canopen a restaurant.But as the payoff comes in Halliday is double crossedby LeClerc. Halliday has to run for his life as the mob chases him and hisgirlfriend, hooker and waitress Cat Duplaisir, wanting their money returned andto deliver a whole heap of revenge.There’s a large degree of ying and yang in LesEdgerton’s stories – the known mixed in with the unexpected and Plastic… is noexception to the rule.I’ve previously reviewed a number of Edgerton’s novelsincluding Just Like That, The Rapist and The Bitch. As you may guess from thetitles alone the author isn’t afraid to make a point. They are typically noirin nature and heavy on crime (big, smiley face from this reviewer). They’reblunt, yet subtle. And there’s no glamourizing the crime either, in fact quitethe opposite. But with each work the author throws a curve ball at the reader –these are by no means your usual crime fare.Plastic… fits into this mould, but Edgerton hasproduced a rip-roaring story of back stabbing and screw ups laced with plentyof black humour - Halliday couldn’t make more mistakes if he tried hisdamndest. And because the novel is written in the first person with Halliday inthe driving seat we really see what the narrator has thrown away and continuesto do so. The guy just can’t help himself. With the kidnap of The King andLeClerc’s subsequent betrayal it seems like Halliday has reached the end of theroad.The characterization in Edgerton’s novels are alwaysstrong. Halliday, and in particular Cat, are excellent. But the supporting castare in there too, holding up their end. The author, an ex-con, often draws onpersonal experience (read Just Like That if you don’t believe me) which givesan extra level of reality to events. As Halliday blunders through the novel byturns I winced and laughed out loud. As usual the author has produced somewriting that’s a little bit different to the rest of us.—Keith Nixon, TheFix“There’s nothing fake about TheGenuine, Imitation, Plastic Kidnapping. Les Edgerton’s latest bookis the real deal, and has everything to keep you turning the pages. It’s acaper, full of fun and high-jinx, but it’s also bitter-sweet, engendering afull range of emotions. You’ll smile, you’ll wince, you’ll laugh out loud, andsometimes you’ll even cringe, but you’ll come away from the read feelingthoroughly satisfied and entertained. A terrific read.” —Matt Hilton, author of the best-sellingJoe Hunter thrillers“When it comes towriting crime stories, Les Edgerton can do pretty much it all, and TheGenuine, Imitation, Plastic Kidnapping finds him in a mood to have fun.This book is like a raucous party for crime fiction lovers, complete withgoons, guns, and schemes-within-schemes. Best of all, the comic voice of itsne’er-do-well narrator is a pleasure from start to finish.” —Jake Hinkson,author of Hell On Church Street and The Posthumous Man“You’re in for sometwisted laughs as one of crime fiction’s most authentic voices takes on darkhumor. In The Genuine, Imitation, Plastic Kidnapping, Les Edgerton findsevery line that oughtn’t be crossed and drags his characters back and forth’til it’s blurred. You may want to reach in and give his criminal hero a shake,except you’re bound to be aching to see what kind of trouble he can createnext. Humor is human, the blacker the better, and Edgerton serves it up nastyand raw!” —Rob Brunet, author of Stinking Rich“TheGenuine, Imitation, Plastic Kidnapping is like the fever-dream of a two-bit conman who fancies himself acriminal genius. Add in some seedy and saucy New Orleans locales and you’ve gota gumbo of freaky sex, covert mob men and botched amputations. This the mosthavoc ever wrought in one man’s quest for a measly ol’ po’ boy shop, and acreole crime caper you won’t want to miss.” —Nik Korpon, author of Fait Ave and Stay God, Sweet Angel“ImagineLes Edgerton’s writing. Dark, despairing noir. Habitual criminals. Rapists.This is nothing like that. : Edgerton takes a break from The Bitch and TheRapist to exercise his inner Westlake. A ‘no holds barred’ and ‘What else cango wrong’ caper with even more laughs than plot twists. The Genuine,Imitation, Plastic Kidnapping has a plot John Dortmunder would have troublenegotiating, and Edgerton milks it for all it’s worth. Not for the faint ofheart, the crime that really sets the story off involved kidnapping agangster—no, I can’t do it. I don’t want to spoil even that much. Suffice to saykidnapping, sexual fetishes, forced amputation, Tourette’s syndrome, certaindeath, and one-way tickets to Skagway, AK are all played for laughs, and hepulls it off. Big fun. My daughter described the movie Ted as “Really funny andwildly inappropriate.” It’s like that. —Dana King, author Grind Jointand A Small Sacrifice“TheGenuine, Imitation, Plastic Kidnapping is a steamy caper novel that reads like an arm wrestling matchbetween Ring Lardner and Quentin Tarantino, while James Lee Burke takes bets onthe outcome. I only stopped laughing to flinch occasionally. A terrific novel,for the strong of heart—and funny bone.”—WarrenMoore III, author BrokenGlass Waltzes“Ahard-driving, relentless story with grab-you-by-the-throat characters.”—GrantBlackwood, New York Times bestselling author“There isnothing quite like reading a Les Edgerton novel. His voice crackles with alifelike intensity. The Genuine, Imitation,Plastic Kidnapping is the most incredible, entertaining and detailedbar story you've ever heard. Reading it, you can't shake that feeling thatyou've living a special, unique moment where anything is possible, like thatnight at the bar.”—Benoît Lelièvre, www.deadendfollies.comI know I'm late for the partyreviewing this one. But that's just me. What you need to know is this; when Leswrites a story, any story, you're instantly swept up into a world that engulfsyou . . . absorbs you . . . into a sensual assult that leaves you speechless.In this one you get the full gamut. Baseball, New Orleans down at its gritiest,back street wonders, sleazy (and not so bright) hoodlums. And a wise ass loserjust smart enough to know better, but not gifted with the ability to say\"No!\" at any time in his life.Les' writing is three demensional. You do not just readwords. You feel . . . taste . . . see things from a prespective few humanbeings have had the pleasure (or maybe, the bad luck) of experiencing firsthand. That, boys and girls, is the mark of a GREAT writer. And yes; just toanswer your question, I'm jealous.—B.R. Stateham, A Killing Kiss, Tough GuysWhen you can turn a forcedamputation into one of the most hilarious scenes I've ever read, you've reallypulled off something good.—Benjamin Sobieck, The Writer’s Guide to WeaponsIf you like Hunter Thompson, youwill love Les Edgerton. The Genuine, Imitation, Plastic Kidnapping is a roughand tumble romp through New Orleans like none that you have had or will everhave. Take a ex-ballplayer, an Indian, and a hooker with a heart of gold (andthe balls to prove it), mix with the swamps of Louisiana, gangsters,politicians, and drugs and well . . . what more can you expect? Edgerton'sphrasing is excellent, the tone tough, and the humor is so Southern. It's allabout the kidnapping and how it went so wrong.—Gregory C. Randall, Chicago Swing: A Tony Alfano ThrillerThe Genuine, Imitation, PlasticKidnapping is a rollicking comedy crime caper in which the protagonist Pete--aformer baseball player turned con man--gets roped into a kidnapping scheme by aless-than-intelligent criminal named Tommy. What follows is a tangled path ofsurprising twists and comedic beats. You'll laugh out loud, guaranteed.Probably the two brightest stars of this book are Pete's love interest Cat andthe beautiful city known as New Orleans. For the latter, Edgerton paints arich, textured portrait of an edgy city. For the former, he introduces us to atough yet classy lady who brings out the best in Pete. Through the wholenarrative, Edgerton maintains the narrator's colorful wise-cracking voice. Youfeel more like you're sitting at a bar listening to a good story over a beer,rather than sitting with a book. According to the book's end notes, Edgerton isworking on a sequel. I, for one, am anxious to see what happens next.—Rob Boley,That Risen Snow: A Scary Tale of SnowWhite and ZombiesNo novel ever deserved the“couldn’t put it down” label more than this one. This black comedy thrillerwill keep you laughing your way through your fear from first page to last.Your guide through the amazing set of cons and mishapsis Pete Halliday, a major league pitcher (for a moment) fallen on hard timesand looking for a score. Pete is earnest and funny and likable, but a more thana tad gullible. His partner/buddy keeps dreaming up new capers. Pete keepsfalling for them. Complications ensue, and the results are bothlife-threatening (to the characters) and hilarious. The biggest caper of all isreferenced in the title, and I’m not saying a word more about it for fear ofspoiling everything. Read it to find out, and I’ll guarantee you’ll be ever andalways glad you did.—Carl Brush, TheMaxwell VendettaPete Halliday's got a hell of anarm... and a little gambling problem. Or is it a little 'getting caught'problem? Either way he's washed out of baseball, biding his time in the BigEasy, pulling jobs with ace fuck-up Tommy LeClerc.In spectacular fashion, Tommy blows schemes so cleverthey shouldn't be done. Like a kidnapping when you don't know whom the kidnapeeis connected to. But then Tommy comes up with a brilliant idea; a kidnappingthe likes of which no one has attempted before...... and maybe there's a reason for that.Pete's a likable guy. He just smart enough to realizehow insane Tommy's plans are, too dumb to tell Tommy to screw off. And it'sthat inability that brings the feet of the whole New Orleans reverse nobilitydown on Pete and Tommy's necks.The ray of dirty sunshine is Cat Duplaisir, waitresswith a side of hooker. Pete falls hard, and she's a great add to the team here.And the ending? Guess you'll have to read it.Overall, I love Pete's way of putting things. He's anarrating character that's reliable, true to form. Edgerton pours this one fromhis fingertips; nothing gets you clogged in the reading, nothing keeps you fromhitting the 'next' arrow except maybe sleep or a pee break (I don't even thinkI took a pee break).I got an advanced copy, But I liked it so much, Ibought the paperback.—Liam Sweeny, Deadman’sSwitch and Other StoriesLet’srock this puppy! Baby needs a new pair of shoes… I appreciate your support!Blueskies,Les"},

She has one of the most original protagonists in literature--wannabe-cop Maisie McGrane who works as a meter maid after getting bounced out of the police academy. She works with a cast of zany characters who Tim Dorsey might wish he'd invented. Janey was able to secure a three-book deal with Kensington and the second in the series comes out in December.This is one of the funniest books I've read in a long, long time! Our class loved each week's installment as they came and couldn't wait for the following week.Here's part of our class in Scottsdale a few years ago. L-R are Joe Beaumont and his lovely, talented wife, Maegan (who also has a three-book deal with Midnight Ink), moi, Linda Thompson (who is finishing up her novel in class for her agent), Suzana Orozco (working on her novel and screenplays), and Janey Mack, our newest author!One of three of Maegan's novels--each one is fantastic!We've got a fantastic class and fantastic group of alumni! As of now, there are five other writers either currently in class or who finished their novel while in class who are poised to publish their novels. I'll keep you updated when they come out.But for now--get TIME'S UP! And wear your Depends--there are places where you'll wet your pants laughing!Blue skies,Les"},

{"title": "ME AND CHARLES MANSON...", "date": "Sunday, June 28, 2015", "text": "Hi folks,I was going over some old blog posts I'd made in the past and ran across one I ran a few years ago. Since there are new people on here now, I thought I'd rerun it for some giggles. It's about me and Charlie Manson and his celly just chinnin'... Hope you enjoy it.Blue skies,LesFormer post from April 15, 2012:Hi folks,I thought you might be interested ina recent exchange I had with author Richard Godwin. Richard is interviewing mefor his blog feature “Chin Wag at the Slaughterhouse.” It’s a fantasticfeature, where he interviews authors and asks the most fascinating and“deepest” questions I’ve ever been asked by any interviewer. Richard isinterviewing me at the suggestion of noir master, Paul D. Brazill, a mutualfriend.Richard conducts his interviews byposing one question at a time. Once you respond to that question, he sends youanother. It’s an exhausting process but when we’re done, it’ll be the mostcomprehensive interview I’ve ever had the pleasure of participating in. I’ll besure to let you know when it appears.I had just sent him my replay to hissecond question and he sent me the third. When he emailed me, he asked me thequestion below and I thought you might be interested in the answer, since it’sabout an old acquaintance, Charlie Manson, and I know there are people outthere who are interested in Manson. (This isn’t the interview question—it’sjust a personal question he asked in response to Paul Brazill’s suggestion thathe do so.)Be advised there are a few instances of strong language.Here’s Richard Godwin’s question andmy reply:Paul (D. Brazill) suggested I askyou about Manson. I do not mean to put you on the spot, this is not part of theinterview. My first novel Apostle Rising was mentioned by a few reviewers inthe context of the Manson killings, as this review showshttp://www.bookgeeks.co.uk/2011/03/23/apostle-rising-by-richard-godwin/All the bestRichard (Godwin).HiRichard,Well,Charlie and I have a bit of a history.Aboutten years ago or so, a professor at the University of Toledo—Dr. RussellRiesling--was writing a book about the drug experiences of famous people duringtheir youth. He had folks like Big Brother of Big Brother and the HoldingCompany and some other folks. For some weird reason, he had a chapter on me.I’d done drugs but definitely wasn’t famous!Anyway,Russ interviewed me for his book (which hasn’t been published yet, alas), andwe became friends. I sent him a copy of my story collection, Monday’s Meal. About two weeks after Isent it, I got a phone call from him. Seems he’d been out to Corcoran Prison tovisit with and interview Charles Manson (who also had a chapter), and duringthe visit, Charlie spotted the copy of Monday’sMeal that Russ had with him. He asked if he could “borrow it” and Russloaned it to him. A few days later, he called Russ and was really excited(according to Russ). He said he’d read the book and loved it and that I was “thereal deal” meaning a real-life outlaw, ex-con. He asked Russ if he’d ask me ifI’d mind if he (Charlie) called me. I told Russ, sure, and thus began a seriesof phone calls from him to me.Now,when I was in prison, we weren’t allowed to call folks. At all. One of the manythings that have changed. Because of that, I wasn’t aware that all such phonecalls are made collect. At the end of the month, after which he called 3-4times a week, I got the bill and it was astronomical! My wife had a cow and Itold Charlie we needed to dial it back a bit. (Pun intended…)Mostly,Charlie talked and I listened. He’s not hard to figure out. He’s a nutcase,pure and simple. Knew lots of guys like him in the joint who just weren’t asfamous. We swapped stories and he may have told me a few things he’d done thathe hadn’t been nailed on and I may have returned in kind, but I won’t talkabout that. Anyway, I kind of got tired of talking to him—it was same-o, same-oall the time—and was about to disassociate myself, when he told me hiscellmate, Roger Smith, really wanted to talk to me. I said okay and thus begana series of phone calls with Roger.Rogerbills himself as the “most-stabbed inmate in U.S. history—and he is. As of thattime, he’d been shanked over 300 separate times. The reason he was Charlie’scellmate was that both were in protective custody as there were hits out onboth of them from just about everybody in Corcoran. Over the years, Roger hadhired himself out as a hit man for every single gang in the joint and now allof them had a hit out on him. The reason he wanted to connect with me was thathe thought I was a “great writer” (his words and they had little effect onme—I’ve been on the receiving end of a shuck job attempt more than once…), andhe wanted me to write his life story. According to Roger, he’d had his “come toJesus” moment and wanted to right all the wrongs in his life. He said he wantedhis life story out there to help keep young kids from following in hisfootsteps. He’d been locked up ever since he was a juvie and all that. Grew upin one joint or another.Ihad to laugh when he told me he was “saved.” He sounded contrite… but everyother word out of his mouth with “fuck this” or “motherfucker this” and hedidn’t sound much like the converts I’d met down at the First Baptist… But,I’ve been inside with a lot of guys who had these jailhouse conversions and hewasn’t unusual.Hetold me Charlie was letting him use his personal secretary—some gal who livesin North or South Carolina (forget which) who has all of Charlie’s journals andcommunications and writings and such and who handles all his commercialbusiness. He can’t profit by books and interviews but he does take checks fromthe networks and publishers and the proceeds all go to charity. Roger told mehe’d kept journals from when he was a little tad tyro outlaw and they were withCharlie’s secretary and he said he’d have her send them to me—from what hesaid, a LOT of journals(!)--and that he’d answer any questions I asked.Itold him I was just too busy with my own work and really couldn’t do thisproject, but he wouldn’t take no for an answer. Called me incessantly, tryingto persuade me to write his life history. Finally, one time, he said, “What’sthe real reason you don’t want to write it, Les?” I asked him if he wanted thereal reason and he said yeah, so I told him. “Roger,” I said, “you’re like aserial killer. In fact, you are aserial killer. Three hundred hits, dude.” “Yeah,” he said. “and why would thatprevent you from writing my story?” To which I answered that serial killers justflat-out bored me (and they do). I told him serial killers just keep doing thesame exact thing, over and over and over, ad nauseum. After about the thirdone, they’re just boring. And, I didn’t want to tie up a year of my life onwriting about some boring-ass serial killer.Therewas a silence and then he exploded. Called me everything but a white man.Sounded kind of like he’d kind of backslid on the “saved” deal. Screamed thatif he ever got out of Corcoran my house was the first place he was heading. Ilistened to him ranting and screaming at me and then said, “Roger?” He gotquiet and then said, “Yeah?” I said, “Roger, you’re not ever getting out ofthere unless there’s a major earthquake and that isn’t likely. But, if somehowyou do get out, I’m aware that you prefer using a shank on your hits and if youcome to my house to nail me, I won’t have a shank. It’ll be something thatmakes a louder noise. So, it’s been nice talking to you and have a nice life,loser.”Andthat’s the last I’ve talked to either Roger or Charlie. But, for awhile we wereall jam.Sothat’s the story of me and Charlie Manson, Richard.Hopeyou enjoyed this little anecdote, folks. And, if you haven’t read RichardGodwin’s books you really should. They’re fantastic.Here’sa link to his latest, Mr. Glamour. Ihighly recommend it.http://www.amazon.com/Mr-Glamour-Richard-Godwin/dp/0956711332/ref=sr_1_1_title_0_main?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1334507812&sr=1-1Blueskies,Les"},
{"title": "NEW REVIEW OF THE GENUINE, IMITATION, PLASTIC KIDNAPPING", "date": "Sunday, June 14, 2015", "text": "Hi folks,Just received this review for THE GENUINE, IMITATION, PLASTIC KIDNAPPING, by Derrick Horodyski and I'm stoked! Just flat-out made my day.        Regular Guy Reading Noir                   Edgerton is a Writing Genius   June 13, 2015     The last two books I read by Les Edgerton were books that cemented him onto my must-read list of authors. Both The Bitch and The Rapist were insightful, wonderful books that had plot depth, characters that jumped off the page, and that little something extra that changes a book from something you simply read into an experience for the reader. When I read the blurb for his latest release, The Genuine, Imitation, Plastic Kidnapping, I saw that it was more of a crime-comedy mix and I wondered how Edgerton would handle this genre change and I wondered if he could reach the bar he set so high with his previous two books.I am pleased to say that this book was a wild and fun read. I prefer dark noir books, so while this book didn’t quite reach the heights of his previous two books, it still stands above many books that are being put out by other authors. I think it is just a personal preference in genres that make me make that statement.The strength of this book is a strength I noted in other Edgerton books; character development. The cast of characters that he parades in and out of the plot of this novel makes reading this book a pleasure. Edgerton has a knack for writing dialogue that rings true for the characters and leaves the reader laughing out loud. His ability to have the reader actually begin to care for his characters and feel invested is the same feeling I had reading his previous books. In other words, the man has great writing chops.If you haven’t read Edgerton before, you should be ashamed of yourself. He is a great author and should be on everyone’s must read list. If you have read him in the past and were unsure if this switch to a crime-comedy mix would yield a book worth reading; put your worries aside and grab a copy of this outstanding and entertaining book. Edgerton will leave you laughing out loud and have you awaiting his next book, regardless of what genre he chooses to write. Take it from a regular guy who loves to read noir, this book will have you fiending for more Edgerton, even if it isn’t a noir book.Highly recommended   This will leave me with a glow that will last for a long, long time!Blue skies,Les"},

{"title": "BACK HOME FROM TEXAS--GREAT TIME!", "date": "Thursday, June 4, 2015", "text": "HiFolks,It’stime to report on my two weeks in Texas! I’m a bit late on doing this as when Ireturned home a bunch of things happened. First, I had to decompress! Stilldoing that, but almost fully recovered.And,then, my son-in-law, Ray Robinson notified me that he’s interested a financialgroup in Louisville to hopefully finance a short version of my novel, THEBITCH, which he hopes to enter at Cannes and Sundance in an effort to interestinvestors in the full-length version. He’s writing the screenplay now.I’malso about to begin strategizing the promotion of my screenplay of THE GENUINE,IMITATION, PLASTIC KIDNAPPING with Voyage Media and producer John Crye. I’mvery excited about the possibilities.And,I needed to get back up to speed with my brilliant writing class—it’s a truelabor of love to be able to work with such a group of extremely talentedwriters, each of whom are going to end up with publishable novels.But…Texas was wonderful! And, I get to do it again next year.First,I flew in to San Antonio a couple of days early, to stay with my good friend,novelist Marjorie Brody. She’d arranged an appearance in her home with her SanAntonio Writer’s Group. We had about twenty-five writers appear and I had afantastic time. Hopefully, we’ll get to do it again next year.(Photoof Marjorie and me at WRW--taken by Gail Provost)Then,Marjorie and I went on to the Oblate Renewal Center for the Writer’s Retreat Workshop with Jason Sitzes and Gail Provost, where Marjorie was a participant and hostedthe Early Morning Sessions and I was on the staff.Marjorie leading a Morning Session.Whata gorgeous place!Above, the back row at a class and below, presenter Carol Dougherty.There,I met up again with fellow staffers and old friend Don Maass, and a guy I metin Oklahoma a couple of weeks before and recommended to Jason that he ask himto present at WRW—Richard Thomas, editor for Dark House Press and writerextraordinaire. I was anxious also to meet one of the members of our privateonline class who was attending—Connie Fulmer. Connie turned out to be aswonderful a person in real life as she is in cyberspace in our class, and I’mso darned proud of her—fellow staffer Carol Dougherty showed a movie and askedeveryone to point out the inciting incident and Connie was the only one to nailit. Yes! Connie also had a major breakthrough in her writing while there and isalready enrolled in next year’s WRW. It’s a life-altering experience for agreat many of those who attend.Don Maass teaching a class.Richardwas a huge hit with everyone and the more I get to hang with him, the more Iknow it’s gonna be good times whenever he’s in the vicinity. Just a greatliterary mind and a terrific person—the kind of guy you want to have beerswith. Ialso got to meet a young lady I’d met in the class I co-taught via Skype withJenny Milchman for the New York Writer’s Workshop a couple of years ago, whocame up and introduced herself with the name I’d given her in class—Apple. Herreal name was Jacqui Wolf and she turned out to be one of my new best friends.Got to hang out with a bunch of new friends and old ones as well. Terrific peopleand writers such as Alexandra Marbach, Barbara Clarke, Camile Di Maio, CarolDougherty, Diane LaCombe, Connie Fulmer, Ellan Otero, Joni Hahn, KatrinaStonoff, Larry Brill, Linda Moore, Linda Zimmerman, Lisa Pirc, Macaire Hill,Marilyn Tucker, Marjorie Brody, Mary Bowers, Matt Brock, Michalea Moore, PattyMayeaux, Rick Bylina, Suanne Shafter and Wondra Chang.Gotto meet and hang out with Matt Brock, one of the presenters and an old friendof Jason’s. Matt teaches at the University of Tennessee and went to school at OleMiss, where he took classes from and hung out with the likes of Barry Hannah!Man! Doesn’t get any better than that! And, he’s a fantastic writer and was theonly other one besides me that smoked so we logged a lot of “bench time.” Infact, Wondra told me she had a visual image of me sitting on the bench outsidethe rooms, smoking, and that would appear in her novel… Can’t wait… maybe…Matt Brock giving talks at WRWSeveralof us got to go down to the Riverwalk and that’s always a fun time!Katrina“Hurricane” Stonoff (I gave her the nickname and she was… a hurricane), didwhat no man or woman has ever done before—embarrassed me by singing to me inthe cafeteria… I played it off, but she really did embarrass me. Now she knows…J I havewonderful memories of each and every person!Duringthe retreat, I rented a car and traveled to Austin for a day on May 16 todeliver my Thelma&Louise presentation to the Writer’s League of Texas  andthere were about twenty-five people in attendance—a terrific group! I got tohang out with Rodney Sprott and when we were done, he took me to the oldest barin the U.S. where they were filming a documentary and we had an adult beverageand really connected.Giving my Thelma and Louise presentationAfterthe week at WRW, I got to go home with Jason and his beautiful fiancé, Lisa, totheir home in Austin where I got to hang out with them and Lisa’s threeterrific kids,  (Working with Jack on his batting stance and throwing mechanics)and then, on Saturday, spent all day with Scott Montgomery atthe BookPeople Bookstore https://mysterypeople.wordpress.com/as a guest of his and Gale Albright, Vice-President of the Sisters in Crime,Heart of Texas chapter, sitting on a panel with fantastic writers ReavisWortham and George Weir, and then doing a signing. I was totally surprised whenone of the participants at WRW, Camille Di Maio, showed up with her husband.Camille has one of the most interesting stories of the century! She’d written anovel based on the Paul McCartney song, Eleanor Rigby, and during a concert she’dattended in San Antonio, McCartney brought her up on stage and read a page fromher novel! Just a wonderful person and wonderful writer. Look for her book—it’sgonna be a mega seller when it comes out next year.George Weir, Reavis Wortham, Scott Montgomery and moi...Afterthe signing, I got to go out with Scott and George Weir and his wife, Jason andLisa, and a few other of the attendees for a bite to eat and some adultbeverages and they all bit the bullet for me, sitting out in a misty rain so Icould do my bit in keeping the tobacco industry flourishing… All I can say is Iappreciate it but if anyone develops pneumonia it wasn’t my fault… I have analibi…Jasonand Lisa took me to some really cool places and I got to eat some of the bestBBQ I’ve ever had… since the last time I was in Texas. The weather wasn’ttypical. During the two weeks I spent there, I saw the sun a total of about twohours… But, that was a good thing. Last year, it was hot, hot, hot and allergy seasonwas in full bloom and I lost 25 pounds and came home half-dead. This year, Igained weight! (An ounce and a half, at least…)Itwas just a wonderful couple of weeks and the best thing is I get to repeat itall next year. Plus, I’d suggested to Jason that he consider asking my hero JoeLansdale to appear as a presenter and unless something changes, Joe will bethere next year! I frickin’ can’t wait!Somuch more happened that I just don’t have room to report on. Just an absolutelymind-blowing two weeks. If you can swing it, I’d recommend attending WRW. It’llchange your live. And, if you’re considering it, I wouldn’t wait long—they’realready filling up all the spots for next year.Hopeto see some of y’all there!Blueskies,Les Jason Sitzes and Camille Di Maio during a class.The grotto at Oblate Renewal CenterPart of the audience at my T ^ Louise presentation.More folks in class."},
{"title": "INTERVIEW WITH COURT MERRIGAN ON ELECTRIC LIT", "date": "Friday, May 8, 2015", "text": "Hi folks,Just had an interview with Court Merrigan on Electric Lit I'm sharing below. Hope you enjoy it!HomeConversationsInterviews That Dark Place, an interview with author Les EdgertonCourt MerriganMay 8, 2015Interviews Share on facebook Share on google Share on twitter Share on email Share on stumbleupon Share on reddit A fearless ex-con and writer of 18 published books, Les Edgerton has seen the elephant, friends, and he’s not going to varnish it for our sakes.Court Merrigan: You say you’re holding out for a deal from Big Publishing. But you’ve already published eighteen books. What gives?Les Edgerton: It’s the only real way to get work in front of people, other than a few thousand at the most. I’ve had legacy deals before and there’s no comparison. Look, the only books legitimate reviewers will look at for the most part are from the big presses. The NY Times isn’t going to look at books from Exciting Books, Ltd., no matter what the quality might be. Barnes & Noble and the other national brick-and-mortar stores aren’t going to carry books by Midnight Nifty Noir Books, no matter how good they are. Just ain’t gonna happen.My desire right now was heightened via a discussion Joe Lansdale and I had recently where he told me flat-out (after reading my books) that I was “underpublished.” I’ve known that for a long time, but just never pushed that hard to get ‘em there.CM: Is that why you really want a big publisher to buy your memoir, then? To reach as many folks as possible?LE: That’s a big part of it. It’s also a case of reaching the right readers. For example, the reviewers for the respected publications such as the NY Times, Paris Review, Washington Post, et al.That’s the area I think independent publishers should band together and go after. Convincing those publications to review books by their quality, not by their publisher. What might help change is if the independent publishers and writers began to make their voices heard by the Times, Post, et al. If, along with the Amazon and Goodreads reviews, folks took it upon themselves to send a letter or an email to those publications that—hey, this is a book you should look at—I’ll bet that after they got even a few hundred of such letters their ears may perk up. A kind of grass-roots campaign focused like this I think might prove effective. If, say, some of the better indies included a brief note on the back page, urging readers who liked the book to write to these folks and urge them to consider reviewing them and provide their email and snail mail addresses to make it easy to do so, I wonder if they would begin to make a difference? I think they would. However, a big part of the problem is the lack of mass market distribution. It’s hard to blame a reviewer who knows that no matter what she says, people are going to find it difficult to get a copy of the book in a bookstore.There’s another advantage to being published by a traditional press that very few talk about or even acknowledge, and that’s the fact that your chances are good that your work will be soundly and professionally edited. And even traditional publishing isn’t what it used to be with editing, by and large.And there are still agents around who do serious editing. I had a personal experience to such a throw-back agent with my friend Janet Reid. A few years ago, she graciously provided me fantastic notes on my novel, The Bitch. Her edits completely transformed it and she wasn’t even my agent—just my friend.Here’s what used to happen in publishing: I sent a novel in to my old agent Jimmy Vines that he loved. I’d rewritten it—by “rewrite” I mean a total, page one to The End that changed entire sections—eight times. In my mind, it was finished. Perfect. Well, ol’ Jimmy had me rewrite it for him… six more times. The editor who signed me for RH, Scott Moyers, then had me do six more rewrites.All that said, I still have hope. It’s why I’m holding out my memoir for one of the big boys. I’ve also got an ace in my sleeve. The president of HBO read it a few years ago and wanted it instantly for his network for a movie. He called it “a Permanent Midnight but with balls.”CM: So why write crime fiction? I take it you don’t don’t agree with those who say the genre is a touch limiting? It’s just… writing. I really don’t pay attention to genre.LE: I wasn’t aware it was limiting. It’s just… writing. I really don’t pay attention to genre. I agree with Nabokov who only recognized two genres—good writing and bad writing. Plus, I don’t just write crime novels. I write mainstream fiction, coming-of-age novels, existential and philosophical novels, YA’s, all kinds of stuff. Not to mention books on baseball, humor and black humor, craft books, etc.I’ve always tried to follow one precept: I write the book I wish someone else had written but hadn’t… so I have to write it to get to read it.CM: You know whereof you speak when it comes to crime. You did hard time as a young man. Care to tell us about it?LE: Sure, Court. I did a couple of years on a 2-5 bit at Pendleton in Indiana. When I was incarcerated there, then-President Johnson commissioned a national panel to study prisons to determine which were the worst. A bunch of us were in the day room watching the only TV in the place when Johnson broke into the program and announced that his study had determined, categorically, that Pendleton was “the single worst prison in the U.S.” We all began cheering and hooting wildly, as if our team had just won the Super Bowl.I went through eight riots during my years there, not counting the one that had happened the day before I arrived, even though I paid for the consequences of that one, also. The inmates had burned everything combustible, including all the mattresses, pillows, and blankets. The superintendant was pissed and he told the inmates that since they’d burned everything they’d have to live without it. He wouldn’t issue mattresses, pillows, any of that stuff. I woke up in the morning with my toes turned blue underneath the snow that came in the windows during the night.A bunch of guys came down with pneumonia and several died. Don’t know how many. In the movies, they show prisons with all these great communication systems–somebody farts in the cell house two cellblocks over and in six minutes, everyone knows it—but in a real prison, somebody can die in the tier above you and you might not know it for a couple of months.CM: How did your prison time affect you? What do you know that we who’ve never been inside don’t?LE: What straights don’t know about the joint would fill a bunch of books. In fact, if folks watched that silly MSNBC program where they go inside joints, they’d think most guys inside were either weight-lifters or psychos. The weight-lifting part always cracks me up. Criminals are basically… lazy. It’s one of the reason we rob places. We don’t want a 9-5. We don’t even want to fetch our own beers while watching the tube. As for pressing iron, way too much work.Getting busted now and then is the price you pay for a kind of freedom insurance salesmen will never experience.Mostly, it was just boring as hell. I saw a lot of bad, bad shit, but I saw a lot of bad shit on the bricks. It was just the price you said for being an outlaw. Getting busted now and then is the price you pay for a kind of freedom insurance salesmen will never experience.I will say the food truly sucks and you’ve got to be “on” all the time and can’t ever relax. You never ever know when the guy you’re just sitting there rapping with, decides to go all medieval.CM: How did you cope with the boredom? Did they have a library or something?LE: Yeah, Pendleton’s “library” consisted of about 20 copies of Zane Grey novels and maybe a dozen other books which were a snooze and intended for a third-grade level. When I go down to visit as I used to do a couple of times a year, I take a bunch of my novels I’ve already read and donate them.As to coping with boredom, I ran a few games to keep semi-busy. Had an on-going crap game, had a loan business, did a lot of drugs and moved some drugs. Even with that though, there was a lot of time just sitting around the cell, naming your toes and teaching your trouser worm tricks… I wrote a lot, as well. Problem is, when I left they confiscated all my notebooks so I’m missing a few novels I wrote.CM: So you wouldn’t say you were “reformed” by your incarceration?LE: Well, I never had a “coming to Jesus” moment and still haven’t. I didn’t actually stop doing criminal acts when I got out. I just stopped getting caught.That’s fairly easy to do. The only way I got caught before was because my rappies got caught and snitched me out. So, I just worked by myself. I can say that now as the statute of limitations has run out on most of the stuff I did.Plus, when I was in, it was when they still believed in rehabilitation. I learned a great trade—cutting hair—and when I got out, I literally had dozens and dozens of job offers. The first week on the bricks I took home $500. That was good money in 1968. Very few of us who’d been through barber school went back.CM: How much of your prison experience has made it into your fiction?LE: Not as much as people think. It was only two years of my life. I always kind of looked down at those people who do something like spend a couple of years in the service and some war and that becomes their entire life—all they write about or think about.In the memoir I’m trying to market, I left out a ton of things about say my Navy years and a ton of stuff about my hairstyling years and so on. I tell a few highlights, but left most of that stuff out. My childhood was a gas, too. For instance, I’d been bartending and waiting tables in my grandmother’s bar since I was eight, and on my 12th birthday she figured I was old enough to work as a dispatcher for her cab company, so I did. During the first two hours of that gig, I watched one cabbie shoot another cabbie in the throat and kill him—blood all over all of us.And that wasn’t even the biggest thing to happen that summer.CM: Eighteen published books over twenty years. Which do you like the best? Is it the best one?It’s a truly scary place and it required more courage for me to go there than I’ve ever had to draw upon in any of the knife or gun fights I’ve been in…LE: The Rapist was the most courageous book I’ve ever written. It represents the best advice I’ve ever gotten from anyone. My first mentor, Elaine Hemley, told me the very best writers reach way down deep inside to that dark place we all have but most of us studiously try to avoid exposing—both from others and from ourselves. That’s the place where truth resides and most writers are unable to go there. It’s a truly scary place and it required more courage for me to go there than I’ve ever had to draw upon in any of the knife or gun fights I’ve been in and I’ve been in more than one.I’m not a rapist by any stretch of the imagination. I’m capable of a lot of sins and crimes and have committed quite a few but that’s just not in my makeup. But I can understand such a person.I set out to do what Charles Bukowski did in his short story, “Fiend”, which is told from a child molester’s POV, albeit in the third person. What he did in that story was to achieve the very pinnacle of what it means to be a great writer in my view. To show that even the most depraved person on earth still retains a faint spark of humanity. This is what great writing is all about: “Martin’s eyes looked into her eyes and it was a communication between two hells–one hers, the other his.”And this is what I set out to attempt in The Rapist. And, I wanted to beat Bukowski. So I cast mine in first-person.I win.CM: You’re 72 now. Recently, Cynthia Ozick said that young writers ought to wait their turn, as today’s old writers once did: “Aspiration is not the same as ambition. Ambition forgets mortality; old writers never do. Ambition wants a career; aspiration wants a room of one’s own. Ambition feeds on public attention; aspiration is impervious to crowds. Old writers in their youth understood themselves to be apprentices to masters superior in seasoned experience, and were ready to wait their turn in the hierarchy of recognition. In their lone and hardened way of sticking-to-it, they were unwaveringly industrious; networking, the term and the scheme, was unknown to them.” As an “old” writer yourself, does this strike you as hifalutin bullshit, or do you think the young folks ought to politely wait their turn – especially for you?LE: Cynthia Ozick is a great writer but I suspect she’s had it pretty cushy most of her life. So, I take what she might say with a grain of salt. I disagree that younger writers should “wait their turn.” That’s bullshit. I do think they need to learn to be good writers before they gain success and that’s something different. That takes time in most cases but some learn how quicker than others.That said, I do think writers would be better off (and there’d be fewer of them) if they had to go through what we once did to get published. My first novel went through 86 rejections before it got accepted. That was pre-internet—you had to snail mail everything and pay postage both ways. I was going to quit on that novel and the 87th house happened to take. It was taken by the University of North Texas Press (which shows where I was at in the submission game as I began alphabetically) and UNT Press had never before published fiction. Nowadays, writers shoot off half dozen or dozen email submission at no cost and without much effort.CM: You published your first book in 1995, so you’ve no doubt seen a lot of writers snag big publishing deals, some at quite young ages. How do you handle the inevitable feeling of “Why the hell is it happening to them, instead of ME?”LE: The first book I sent out got published. I should have been published years before that, but I didn’t have a clue how to get about it. Later on, when my second book came out, a collection of stories titled Monday’s Meal, one of the stories included in it I’d written when I was 12 and one when I was 10. Didn’t change a word of either. So, I’d written publishable work as a young kid, but just didn’t know how one got their stuff published. This was before I was even much aware there were things called agents.Later I signed with Jimmy Vines and then wrote a crime novel and Jimmy took it to auction. Came down to two publishers—St. Martin’s and Random House. SM offered me $50,000 and RH $45,000. I went with Random House. I was on my way. I was one of those “young writers.” I quit cutting hair and became a full-time writer.Wrong move. Three weeks later, Bertlesmann bought Random House and my book got jettisoned.Jimmy told me to brush it off. That he’d get my next novel sold for a bunch of money and then we’d resell the R.H. novel for six figures this time. That would have been great except Jimmy got drummed out of the SAR and I was left high and dry.Most of his writers quickly found other homes. I didn’t. I didn’t know how to do that. I went along agentless for some time and sold some other work, but not with big deals. I should have gone after a top, top agent and I could have then, but I didn’t know who the top agents were and I didn’t know how to glom onto one. Today, inside knowledge like this is all over the place. Back then, it wasn’t. Especially not to a guy living in the Great Flyover who didn’t hang out with other writers at all. I just stayed in my room and wrote.They like to be known as the person who “discovered” the rising genius, but it doesn’t carry the same cachet for them to be known as the person who published the same guy’s second or third work.It’s so little about the quality of the work. It’s mostly about a few key individuals in publishing who control the industry. When Jimmy took that novel out to market and the subsequent auction, he felt he had to tell everyone it was my “first” novel. Well, that was a lie. It was my second novel and my first novel and my first story collection were already out, but he didn’t dare tell publishers that. They froth at the mouth to publish a “first novel” but not a writer’s second novel. They like to be known as the person who “discovered” the rising genius, but it doesn’t carry the same cachet for them to be known as the person who published the same guy’s second or third work. Very little of the decisions made are based on actual quality. There are a hundred writers working today that I’m very familiar with their work and it’s as good if not better than most of the so-called bestsellers. You, yourself, Court, are a prime example. A mutual friend of ours—Neil Smith—is another one. I could easily name a hundred apt examples.This is going to raise all kinds of trolls, I can guarantee you. People who will get pissed and call me everything in the book. No prob. It’s also going to irritate others who won’t respond publicly but when I see ‘em at Bouchercon aren’t gonna buy me a drink. Whatever… I’m just tired of all this false hope that’s always paraded on the Internet by the chattering classes. Most of it ain’t reality.Here’s what I know for a fact. That the editor of a major thriller imprint was told by his boss that if he signed a book that didn’t net a minimum of $50,000 he’d be fired. A net profit. By the chief editor of a major imprint. Not that he’d get his expense account limit lowered or he’d lose the corner office. Fired. I won’t say who it is, but this isn’t a guy who cares about quality, at least not in my opinion.I’m not implying that the writers who get the big deals these days are hacks. Many of them are immensely talented. But, for every one who cops a great deal there are twenty others who are just as talented and oftentimes, more so. If a writer thinks it’s about the quality of the work and that life is fair, then the best place for that person is teaching grade school where they still tell kids that crap and the little saps believe ‘em.CM: I have a second-grader, Les, that I think I’ll keep in the dark a little longer. Maybe until middle school? Thanks, Les.LE: Thank you, Court. You ask good, tough questions and it’s rewarding when I encounter an interviewer like yourself. It’s what you get when the interviewer is a terrific writer himself."},

{"title": "OWFI WAS AWESOME!", "date": "Tuesday, May 5, 2015", "text": "Hifolks,Well,I’ve been home from Oklahoma City for a full day now and am pretty welldecompressed and ready to talk about my experience there.Inshort, it was WONDERFUL! I’ve been to a ton of writing conferences—some as anattendee and some as a presenter—and while just about every one of them was agreat experience, not a one is any better than the OWFI (Oklahoma Writer’sFederation Inc.) annual event. This is such a “user-friendly” gathering and Ienjoyed every single moment—from being allowed to get up and yak in front ofeveryone to the moments I spent in my “office” – the front of the hotel where Ismoked and got to meet and chat with all kinds of people like “Goatboy” FrankSteele and his play writing partner Amy Shojai, to Vickey Kennedy to BeckyFranklin to a whole bunch of people I wish I could name but would run out ofroom. I better explain the nickname I gave Frank Steele—“Goatboy”—before hevisits me and I end up in a Ft. Wayne swamp with a .22 rattling around in mybrainpan. Actually, I don’t think Frank would ever do that, but… During one ofmy talks, I did a Q&A and Frank asked me something from way back in theroom and I couldn’t hear anything but one word—“goat.” So, naturally… He turnedout to be one of my new best friends and we did our best to keep the tobaccoindustry running smoothly.I’dbeen looking forward to the convention for many months, ever since my ForeverBest Friend, Dawn Allen invited me to be the keynote speaker. My one regretduring the event was that we never got to spend a lot of time together. She wasbusy organizing everything and putting our fires and I was busy… smoking…Inone respect, I don’t like doing these summaries. They’re like interviews whereyou’re asked to name your favorite writers and after you’re done and it’s goneto print, you think of ten others you wished you’d mentioned. I know right nowI’m going to forget someone and then hate myself for not recognizing them. So,to whoever I leave out, please forgive me—it’s my Halfzeimer’s at work again! Idon’t know how many were in attendance—I had thought 5-600 hundred and then sawsomething that said there were 1500, and I don’t know, but I think I got tointeract with at least a thousand of them and each meeting was fantastic.Oneguy I won’t forget is Lee Lofland. Lee and I have been online friends for along, long time and I was anxious to meet him in person. Being—you know—fromthe criminal class while Lee is from the “enemy” class—a former cop. Nosurprises—we hit it off famously. Cops and outlaws aren’t all that different—it’slike that thin line that separates geniuses and idiots (criminals being thegenius side, of course…)—we’re more alike than we’re different. We got to sharea bunch of stories and I told him and meant it—that in my criminal days, itwould have been an honor to have been cuffed by him… if he could catch me… Justa great, great guy.Anotherguy was Doug (Dougy) Kelley, who was a hoot! Dude has some great stories abouthis pilot adventures, especially a few encounters he had with Bill Clinton.Dougy (he’s gonna hate that!) did so danged much to help me out. I wish he’dadopt me and give me a good home… Had great, great conversations with him andCarol Johnson who is drop-dead gorgeous and sooooo funny!Imet Richard Thomas in Chicago where it turned out we were on the same flight.What a great guy! Unfortunately, he had to leave early because of illness withhis family, but I got to attend one of his talks and it was fantastic. We’regoing to meet up again in a few days at the WRW event in San Antonio and shouldget a lot of face-to-face time there. A totally interesting and informativewriter-dude!Gotto chat (not enough) with the lovely and charming Michelle Johnson—really abrilliant mind.And,then, there’s H.B. Berlow… whose real name is “Hugh” which explains his use ofinitials. He became my New Best Friend… well, one of ‘em. We REALLY hit it off.I’m sorry I missed him just as I was leaving as Jack Lord emailed me to see ifhe could get his shirt back from him… If you look at the photos of Hughy andme, you’ll see why we hit it off so well—we both look like we belong on thepost office wall… I don’t, but he does…NatashaHanova and Maria Veres were just two of the many people who really rocked andkept things running smoothly. And were just fun people to chat with.Twoof my best friends for years online made the drive from Kansas so we could meetin person and that was a super treat. Mike Klaassen and BR Stateham and hislovely wife. Didn’t get to spend nearly enough time with them. BR’s one of myfavorite crime writers and Mike’s a writing teacher who is also an editor forWikipedia. Years and years ago, he emailed me (I didn’t know who he was at thattime) to tell me he’d taken the liberty of creating an Wikipedia entry for meand I didn’t know what to say at the time, except “thanks.” Then, when I toldmy teenaged son Mike about it, he proceeded to tell me that it was a really bigdeal and that I was so five minutes ago. Thanks, Mike—for doing the one thingthat made my boy think I was something other than the guy who made him make hisbed up in the morning…Gotto meet a bunch of heavyweights in the writing game. Folks like Mel Odom whohas written over 200 books—what th’ hell? Does he ever sleep? Got to see my ol’buddy Jodi Thompson who I met last year at the Dallas-Ft. Worth writer’sconvention.Abunch of other people I’ll always remember—folks like Eric Reitan to whom Iintroduced the subject of philosophy to and recommended some books he shouldtry for an intro to the subject (that’s an inside joke, folks…), Tony LoPresti,Vinita Eggers, Holly Jahangiri, the two lovely ladies I sat with for awhile atthe bar, a gorgeous redhead and beautiful blonde—sorry, ladies for not knowingyour names! (Halfzeimer’s…), and just a host of wonderful, lovely, talentedfolks.Iwill never forget the warm hospitality and the many friendships I forged inOklahoma City. You are indeed, a gracious people and I love all of ya! I hopeyou’ll consider having me back some day. It truly was the best time I’ve everhad with all my clothes on.(Back home, decompressing...)Now.I have to go draw the bath and strew the rose petals… I missed our regularFriday night sesh with my lovely wife Eye Candy and have to make up for it.Which means I’ll have to spring for an extra two Bics…And,again, I am truly sorry for the folks I forgot to mention and I know I have.Please know that you’re not forgotten in my heart!Blueskies,Les"},
{"title": "GRAB A SOFT DRINK AND SOME POPCORN AND JOIN US!", "date": "Wednesday, April 29, 2015", "text": "Hi folks,Here's an interview I did recently for the Writer's League of Texas in conjunction with an upcoming appearance I'm making with them on May 16. Details are on their website. I can't wait! Instructor SpotlightPosted by Writers' League Staff       Les Edgerton has published eighteen books including the novel The Genuine, Imitation, Plastic Kidnapping and his most recent work, Finding Your Voice: How to Put Personality in Your Writing. His fiction has been nominated for the Pushcart Prize, O. Henry Award, Edgar Allan Poe Award, PEN/Faulkner Award, the Derringer Award, Spinetingler Magazine Best Thriller Award, Texas Institute of Letters Jesse Jones Book Award, and the Violet Crown Book Award, among others. One of his screenplays was a semifinalist in the Academy Award’s Nicholl’s Foundation and another was a finalist in both the Writer’s Guild Awards and Best of Austin Screenplay competition. He’s taught creative writing for the UCLA Extension Writer’s Program, was the visiting writer-in-residence for the University of Toledo for three years, and the visiting writer for Trine University. He currently teaches an ongoing private novel-writing class and provides private coaching.Les is teaching a class for the Writers’ League called “Watch to Write: Lessons for Novelists in Thelma and Louise” at St. Edward’s University. A native Texan, Edgerton is making several appearances in Texas this summer including this workshop, an appearance at BookPeople in Austin, an appearance before the San Antonio Writer’s Group, and will be on staff for the Writer’s Retreat Workshop at the Oblate Retreat in San Antonio, all in May. Details can be found on his website. Read the interview below and visit the class page to learn more.Scribe: When did you know you were a writer? Was there a defining moment in your personal history?Les Edgerton: I knew at about the age of five. When I read my first book by myself I knew at that moment that I wanted to be a writer. I’ve never wavered for a moment. I thought at the time I could write a better story than the one I just read. I couldn’t then… but I can now.Scribe: You’ve been a lot of things — homeless, a hairstylist, a life insurance agent, among other things. Do your array of experiences provide a foundation for writing?LE: I wouldn’t call it a “foundation” exactly. It’s always been about material and experiences. When I was very young, I knew I wanted to be a writer and I thought at the time the best way to accomplish that was to accumulate experiences and then write about them, ala Jack London. A couple of years ago, I read an interview with Flannery O’Connor and she said if a person lived for the first 17 years of their life in the same house and same little town, he/she would have enough material for a lifetime of writing. Wish I’d read her years before—I could have saved myself a lot of trouble! Except, I’d do the same thing. I knew at that early age that one day—if I lived long enough—that I’d be 80 years old and sitting in that wheelchair at the nursing home with that blanket over my lap and all the money, cars, houses, clothes, et al, wouldn’t mean a thing, but if I had memories, I’d have something. I’ve got those memories now and wouldn’t trade them for anything.Scribe: You recently published a book on craft. When did you become confident enough in your writing ability to start being able to write about writing?LE: When I was in my thirties. I wrote Finding Your Voice, but it wasn’t published until my forties. I wrote it a few years before that, but didn’t know how to go about getting it published until a few years later. Actually, I knew how to get published but craft books don’t earn large advances as a rule and my agent at the time didn’t want to mess with something that was only going to offer a $10,000 advance. So, eventually I just sent it out myself.Scribe: What is the intersection of film and books? What advantages do books have over movies and vice versa?LE: The “intersection” is that they’re both forms of storytelling and that’s what good fiction is always about—creating a story. Books have a decided advantage over films because novels allow the writer to include the protagonist’s thoughts, whereas movies only show what can be seen and heard. That means that they naturally can provide more depth. Movies have an advantage over books in their production values—the senses of sight and sound are affected much more profoundly. That advantage however, is also a disadvantage, simply because they affect more than one sense. That reduces the audience’s level of active participation. The audience of a movie is more of a passive subject as most of the experience is provided for them and they don’t need to bring much to the experience to gain the benefit. As Marshall McLuhan so brilliantly delineated, a media that only affects one sense (as in reading) requires the audience to bring their imagination to bear to make the experience work, i.e., a “cool” media. Movies, being a “hot” media, don’t require nearly as much imagination from the participant, who merely has to sit there and experience the story passively. One’s brain usually isn’t overtaxed watching a movie… That “dumbing of America” that received so much press years ago really is true, as our entertainment tastes evolved to where more people went to movies and watched TV and reduced their reading, so did the overall intelligence as their imaginations were utilized less and less… To enjoy a movie, all one has to do is sit there and not do a whole lot of thinking. Reading, however, requires an active imagination, not to mention a larger source of information to call upon. What’s interesting is that old chestnut often posed–which did you like better, the movie or the novel?—was found in studies to be bound to whichever form the story was experienced in first. If a person read the book first, overwhelmingly they claimed to like the book better. If they saw the movie first, the movie won out. It’s basically a case of expectations. If you saw the movie first, you’ll “see” the characters a certain way and the book usually won’t match up to those expectations, and the reverse holds if the person read the novel first. Although there are always a certain percentage of those polled who will almost always answer one or the other consistently, probably because they have a bit of the “snob” gene working…There’s another advantage to movies these days. When movies began their existence, they borrowed their structures from literature. However, nowadays the opposite is true. Today’s novels borrow their structure from film. Two good examples of that are transitions and beginnings. When movies began, they borrowed transitive models from books—that old “meanwhile, back at the ranch” scrolling across the screen as we went from one scene to another. All of that is gone and transitions ala the models we used even ten years ago in novels are fast disappearing. Beginnings in movies used to be taught along the same lines as novel beginnings. In movies, that used to be a standard ten minutes. No mas. Today, the setup time isn’t usually much more than a few seconds, or at most a minute or two. Same way with novels, because of the influence of film—no more beginning with setup and backstory and all that nonsense these days… At least not in work that wants to have a chance of being published.Scribe: Why Thelma and Louise and not another movie?LE: Great question! I’m writing a new craft book based on this workshop and T&L and at first, I intended to use parts from a lot of movies. I have a library of over 1,000 movies and meant to draw from many of them at first. However, the more I looked at other films, the more weaknesses I saw in all of them. Thelma & Louise was the only movie I’ve seen that doesn’t have a single writing weakness in it. Every single frame presents a valid and valuable teaching moment. I simply can’t say that about any other movie I’ve ever seen. There are a couple that come close, but none that were as consistently brilliant as this movie is. It’s quite simply a work of genius as the audience will discover. I’ve watched it over 200 times and I keep looking for a flaw but so far haven’t been able to find one. I’m speaking of writing techniques here. There are other movies I Iike better on an entertainment level, but none approach even remotely the level T&L does in providing perfect teaching lessons on how to write publishable, contemporary fiction. None come close to it. Discovering that was great, as it makes it extremely easy to use for teaching and a beautiful model for learning. In a workshop situation, I don’t have to rely on the audience knowing a bunch of movies to see great examples instantly. Virtually everything a writer needs to know and understand about contemporary fiction writing techniques will be shown at our gathering. And, they’ll get to see not only flawless writing but how the whole of the many parts comes together to create a powerful story. That is really important to me as I see a lot of writer education based on bits and pieces of diverse work presented as examples. We learn “parts” of writing, but not story as much. By watching a film that works on every single level and to see how all the parts we’ll go over come together into a seamless story, is extremely valuable. Please believe me that after watching this movie the way we will, I unhesitatingly guarantee the participant’s writing I.Q. will be raised significantly. If you attend you’ll see what I mean and I’m very confident you’ll feel like I’ve understated just how great a teaching and learning tool this movie presents. I predict participants will look back and identify many, many “aha!” moments.Scribe: Last question … will there be popcorn?LE: I hope so! Like Blanch Du Bois, I depend on the kindness of others. The only thing I’m not working at this showing is the concession stand…— Thanks, Les!"},

Years ago, I wrote my first craft book, Finding Your Voice, and Writer’s DigestBooks published it. Last year, they decided not to bring out an ebook versionand graciously gave me back my ebook rights to it. My agent went about the workof getting out an ebook version and it’s continued to do wellWell,Writer’s Digest has recently sold out all the paperback copies of it and again,graciously ceded me those rights also. And, we were able to bring out thepaperback version of it along with the ebook and now you can obtain it in apaperback version.Thatmeans it’s now available in three versions—ebook, paperback and also a Snippetsversion. The Snippets version is really cool. It’s an abridged ebook versionand sprinkled with “snippets” (videos) of me discussing various pointsthroughout the book. I had a lot of fun helping create it and I’ve had a lot ofpeople tell me they really like the idea of watching the videos.Theebook and paperback version are available here on Amazon. The Snippets versionis also available at their site and also on the blog here.Hopeyou enjoy one of the versions!Blueskies,Les Back to Calendar    Hi folks,There's still a few spots left in my upcoming presentation on May 16 from 10 am - 4 pm at St. Edwards University for the Writer's League of Texas.

Thank you!Watching good movies can make you a better fiction writer.That’s the entire premise of this workshop. The power of visual storytelling can allow writing teachers to demonstrate fiction-writing techniques in a more effective and entertaining way. In this class, we will watch the movie Thelma & Louise in its entirety, stopping frequently to desconstruct and discuss techniques that Callie Khouri (the screenwriter) uses to create a wonderful work of art—the same techniques used by the best fiction writers. Virtually every frame of this movie offers a valuable teaching moment for writers, and on top of that it provides an entirely pleasurable way to learn.Class take-aways will include:- How actions both inform characterization and provide a dynamic means to create character arc, creating believable, exciting people and not “characters.”- How to write riveting scenes and set up future scenes up by foreshadowing.- How to handle exposition and backstory.- Giving your characters physical actions to define them and show character arc.- How to utilize setting to define character.- Surface-problem and story-worthy problem--How each is related and resolved.- How to write resolutions that satisfy emotionally.- How to create “watercooler moments”- A bonus takeaway is learning how to create a novel that is cinematic in nature which could help sell it as... you guessed it...a movie!This workshop would be valuable to every skill level of writer—from the raw beginner to the polished writer who has been published several times. And, even though it’s an event geared to novel writers, the same principles we’ll cover apply also to screenwriters. So… everybody is welcome!About the instructor:Les Edgerton has published eighteen books. His fiction has been nominated for the Pushcart Prize, O.

{"title": "NEW REVIEW OF THE GENUINE, IMITATION, PLASTIC KIDNAPPING", "date": "Thursday, April 9, 2015", "text": "Hi folks,Just got agreat review from my friend and fellow writer, Gregory C. Randall, on his blog, Writing 4 Death.Greg and Imet in person at the last Bouchercon in Long Beach and instantly hit it off. Iwas already a fan of his books and we had corresponded via the Intergnat, andwere “Gnat” friends, and when I met him in the flesh, we became great friends.He’s the kind of guy you enjoy having drinks with. And, then, he cemented ourfriendship when, after I got finished with a panel I was on, he came up andpresented me with a San Francisco Giants t-shirt, commemorating their latestWorld Championship! No one’s ever done anything like that!Anyhoo,here’s Greg’s review of Kidnapping…Review by Gregory C. Randall The Genuine, Imitation, PlasticKidnappingBy Les EdgertonLes Edgerton and I share a few things, most especially our love andappreciation of baseball and the San Francisco Giants. His latest book The Genuine, Imitation, Plastic Kidnappingis just downright fantastic and tres-tres cool. Les, after more than a dozenbooks covering everything from baseball to many things underworld in NewOrleans, knows exactly how to hit that nerve that is both sharp and edgy. Hisprose is as crisp and crusty as a backroads Louisiana road-kill and as soft andmushy as a Café Du Monde beignet.Pete Halliday is a failed baseballplayer (ex-Giant); seems he has this thing for gambling and it cost him hisspot in the rotation and the team. Now in debt to a bookie he needs to get achunk of money or suffer badly – and the best way out . . .kidnap the head ofthe local Cajun Mafia, cut off his hand, and hold the thing for ransom. Andthat’s just the main leitmotif of the story. There’s also the hooker with aheart of gold, a guy who thinks he’s a real Indian (maybe not), a double-cross,a classic case of Tourette’s syndrome in the face of some serious killers, andof course New Orleans. A place that Les says has broken his heart sinceKatrina. It is relentless and pulls you under like a fifteen-foot alligator inthe bayou. It is a five star must read.That’s it—thanks, Greg! As I’m notone who disbelieves in the philosophy of quid pro quid—I do—I’d like torecommend his own work. A great place to start would be with his DIAMONDS FORDEATHI firmly adhere to the principle of quidpro quid but only when the work merits it… and Greg’s work most assuredly does.Blue skies,Les"},

{"title": "Review of WORM by Anthony Neil Smith", "date": "Tuesday, March 3, 2015", "text": "Hi folksHere's my take on Neil Smith's latest masterpiece:ReviewI can’t think of anyone who topsAnthony Neil Smith in writing Everyman tales in which the average Joe, upagainst the world, makes the wrong choices for the right reasons and keepsplunging deeper and deeper into the abyss. Lee Child said the secret to creatingpage-turners was to keep posing story questions on every page. This is exactlywhat Smith does in every novel he writes and his latest, Worm, is a master’s class in how to keep tension on every singlepage. His character Ferret just wants what most of us want—to provide a betterlife for his family. His desire is honorable but unfortunately his options arelimited and what happens to him as he pursues the American dream isall-too-often what happens to many others with that same dream—disaster. Yearsfrom now, Smith will be viewed as one of the best writers of our generation—he’sjust not capable of writing anything but a fantastic novel. If you haven’t yetread him, glom onto this book and when you finish it, pick up another masterpieceby this writer who is, indeed, a literary treasure. And, kudos to Blasted Heathbooks for putting out another winner.If you haven't read DocNoir's work, you really should. He's just one of my favorite writers and I steal as much as I possibly can from himBlue skies,Les"},

{"title": "ANTAGONISTS AND PROTAGONISTS", "date": "Monday, February 16, 2015", "text": "Hi folks,I recently received an email from emergingwriter Ashley Gaumond who asked a couple of really good questions and I thoughtI’d answer them here as I’m sure there are others who visit here who might havethe same questions.Ashleyasks:1.Does a short prologue have to follow the standard rule for a scene (goal,conflict, disaster)?My answer: Well, first of all, as ageneral rule, I don’t believe most prologs are useful or necessary. In general,I find that at least from beginning writers, most are created because they’vebeen told they shouldn’t begin a novel with backstory and setup, and they’vefound an all-consuming need to provide… backstory and setup. If they call it a “prolog”they feel they’ve dodged the rule… That doesn’t mean that all prologs are bad,and occasionally we’ll see one that works and works well. But… that’s only occasionally. At least, in myexperience. I think if you’ll look at the ones that get published you’ll oftenfind that if they were left out, it didn’t affect the book adversely at all.In Hooked, I talk about prologs a bit, and use the example of LarryWatson’s wonderful novel, Montana, 1948.It’s an absolute terrific book and he has a well-written prolog. But, I don’tthink it was needed at all. Mostly what it did was… provide backstory/setup.Which did nothing for the book, to be honest. I think a lot of writers—especiallynewer writers—think they make a novel look like… a novel. They just kind oflook “official” or something. Most are written in kind of a melodramatic style—thetone being—“Here’s a person who has undergone something really heavy andemerged sadder, yet wiser.” That kind of thing. Well, if you just read thenovel sans the prolog and it’s written well, you’ll probably emerge from theexperience feeling, “This was a person who underwent something really heavy andemerged sadder, yet wiser.” Without the nudge of a prolog… It just seems to methat prologs written for that reason are pretty much saying the author doesn’ttrust the reader’s intelligence to grasp that without the author pointing itout in the beginning.As to your question, does it have tofollow the standard rule for a scene, why would it? Most prologs aren’t scenesto begin with—they’re the internal monologue of the character or purportedly anoutside judge of the events to come—and while some may contain a scene—which bynecessity is a past event and therefore nearly tensionless—most are kind of asermonette delivered to convince the reader that what they’re about toexperience is… emotional and powerful. Personally,I kind of take offense to someone telling me how I’m supposed to react to theread. It feels like they're telling me I need to feel guilty if I don't experience what they told me I would after reading it.And, some people love ‘em.I’m just not one of those people.Convince me your novel is a big deal by the writing itself.Ashleyasks:Regardingantagonists, can every character except for the POV character serve as anantagonist at some stage in a novel (even the \"good\" ones)? I see anantagonist simply as someone (not just a villain!) who challenges theprotagonist at any given time.My answer: First, I’d like toprovide a definition for the protagonist and the antagonist. The protagonist issimply the person through whose viewpoint you experience the story. Theantagonist is simply the individual whose goals conflict with those of theprotagonist’s. In my view, it’s a really big mistake to view either of these people in moralterms, i.e., the protagonist as “hero” and the antagonist as “villain.” Sameapplies to that dumb term, the “M.C”. It’s not the “main character” boobies—it’sthe protagonist. This is simple stuff, kids… What happens when you do that isyou tend to create one-dimensional, cardboard characters. Cartoons. SnidelyWhiplash vs Snidely Doright. Yuch. I see these kinds of terms used often inwriter’s advice and I really have a jones against them. When you begin to thinkof your characters as heroes and villains, you’ve just dumbed down the storyimmensely, in my opinion. You’ve almost completely destroyed the possibility ofcomplex characters with that kind of mindset. In the worst instance, you’vecreated a morality tale and, as Samuel Goldwyn said to a screenwriter whobrought him a screenplay with a moral “message”: “Don’t send a message. Write astory. If you want to send a message, use Western Union. They’re much better atit. Just write a good story.” Perfectly said.This is the kind of thinking thatled years ago to that term “anti-hero.” If you think of protagonists simply asthe person through whose viewpoint you experience the story, all that moralitygoes out the window as utter nonsense. The term “anti-hero” comes about as asubset of thinking in terms of heroes and villains, good vs evil. So, if awriter creates a protagonist who is seen in terms of good vs bad and they’re “bad”then they’re an antihero. Fairly infantile and limited thinking in literaryterms. Just my opinion, but it’s the only one I have…And, you can’t write a good story ifit’s simply “good guy vs bad guy.” That’s just junk writing. That’s Snidely tyingNell to the railroad tracks and Dudley rescuing her… Again… yuch… Cartoon stufffor Saturday morning on the floor in your jammies… Junk food for the mind. Nothing to see here folks--move along...Before I completely answer yourquestion, Ashley, here’s what a story consists of.1. A protagonist who has anexperience that profoundly changes his/her life and therefore creates a storyproblem. (And the only place for a contemporary, publishable story to beginwith. Probably not with a prolog that provides an outline of what's to come, attendant with a drum roll warning you as to the coming emotion you'll experience...)2. His/her struggle to resolve thatproblem against increasing obstacles and opposition.3. His/her resolution to thatproblem, containing both a win and a loss in that resolution.Okay. Notice I made protagonistsingular. That’s because it has to be one person. If there is more than one,the reader’s interest is hopelessly diffused. We see clearly one person. We don’tsee two or more, at least not clearly. A book about capitalism vs communism won’twork if it’s about the U.S. army vs the Chinese Communist army. If, however, it’sabout the commanding general of the U.S. army vs his counterpart of the Chinesearmy, then, yes, it can work. Or a private in each army vs his counterpart inthe other. Whatever. When I see work that tries to do that, I know instantlythat this writer has put the cart before the horse. He or she is thinking interms of “theme.” And, for writers, theme is something that should be thoughtof only after the first draft is done. It’s at that point that we figure outwhat the story is about in terms of loglines, which is what a theme actuallyis, and then apply that to the rewrite. Check any issue of TV Digest for themes... Anything that doesn’t fit the themeupon rewrite needs to be exorcised. But, it’s not something a writer shouldeven consider when writing initially. Just write a story.And, the antagonist should be asingle person as well. Same reason. We can’t visualize multiple people nearlyas well as we can an individual. Does that mean there can’t be others who opposethe protagonist? Not at all. There can be many, many people who provideopposition… and there probably should be. But… they’re not antagonists. They’remerely people who do antagonistic things.Here’s the perfect example—the film Thelma & Louise. The protagonist isThelma. Contrary to what some might think, she and Louise aren’t “co-protagonists.”It’s Thelma’s story. Louise is along for the ride and experiences many of thesame things Thelma does, but it’s Thelma’s story, all the way. Louise, if youwant to assign arch-types, is the “Older Mentor” type. She’s not really older—they’rethe same age in the movie, but she’s the one with more experience. Her story isnecessary but it’s subservient to Thelma’s.Now. The antagonist. When I showthis movie, I usually ask the audience who they think the antagonist is. Veryfew get this right and that’s because largely they haven’t learned to think ofstory with the writer’s eye. The usual answer I get is her husband Darryl.Well, Darryl ain’t the antagonist. He does antagonistic things, but he justplain ain’t the antagonist. The second-most-common answer is Harlan, thewould-be rapist who Louise shoots and kills. Again, not. The antagonist is Halthe cop. Darryl is Snidely Whiplash. So is Harlan. As are most of the other menin the story. Just a bunch of guys who do antagonistic things but aren’t theantagonist.Look at the definition of theantagonist. He’s the individual whose goals conflict with those of theprotagonist. Which is exactly what Hal does. Thelma wants to escape—Hal wantsto catch her. Nothing moral in this. In fact, Hal is the nicest guy in theentire story. He only wants to catch Thelma to save her—first, from beingcharged falsely in Harlan’s murder and next to save her life. If Callie Khouri(the screenwriter) had thought in terms of “heroes and villains” she probablywould have come up with what my wife Mary calls a “chasey-fighty movie” andgone direct to video if it would have been made at all. It’s because Khouridoesn’t think in those terms, but with the correct definitions of protagonistand antagonists. Her protagonist has a problem and her antagonist wants tothwart her resolution of that problem. It’s that simple. And, yet, creatingcharacters under that definition leads to incredibly complex characters andsituations.And, yes, there are all kinds ofcharacters in the story who do bad things to Thelma. But, only one person isabove and beyond all others as the antagonist. The other characters—Darryl, Harlan,the truck driver, the state cop, et al—all do things to thwart Thelma but they areall limited in their opposition. Hal is the one who remains steadfast duringthe entire story to thwart Thelma’s goal—escape. And, he also satisfies thedimensions of a great antagonist—he is very, very powerful. He's very smart, has years ofexperience in catching criminals, has almost unlimited resources—state police,FBI, helicopters, dozens if not hundreds of pursuit vehicles, many, many guns,communication abilities—it goes on and on. The strength of a novel depends onthe strength of the antagonist. You should write that down. I’ll repeat it: The strength of a novel depends on thestrength of the antagonist. There are lots of writing “rules” that aren’talways necessary, but that’s one that really always holds true. Think ofclassics like The Silence of the Lambs.One of the most powerful antagonists in literary history. Think of Cape Fear. Personally, I’d spend farmore time on the antagonist than even the protagonist. And, I’d always makethat an individual. And, supply lots of other characters who also doantagonistical things to the protagonist. They’re allowed to have helpers andshould have many of those.So, Ashley, the antagonist is not “someone(not just a villain!) who challenges the protagonist at any given time.” It’sthe individual who provides a constant obstacle to the protagonist all of the time on an up close-and-personallevel.So, please don’t think of thesefolks as “heroes and villains.” That’s kind of a good path to self-publicationas the only avenue to seeing your book in print…Hope that helps!Blue skies,LesMe and Anonymous 9 discussing prologs..."},
{"title": "AN AWARD AND INTERVIEWS", "date": "Saturday, February 14, 2015", "text": "Hi folks,Have some stuff to share--be forewarned, this is long and you may want to read it in parts--an award from crime writer/weapons expert Ben Sobieck for my latest novel, THE GENUINE, IMITATION, PLASTIC KIDNAPPING and a couple of interviews Mr. Sobieck had with me.Also, be forewarned that there are some instances of violence and stuff the PC crowd will frown at.  The Dubious CrimeFictionBook Awards2014 Best Crime Humor Novel: The Genuine, Imitation, Plastic Kidnapping by Les EdgertonThere isn’t a crime novel I readthis year that went for broke in the humor department quite like The Genuine, Imitation, Plastic Kidnapping by LesEdgerton. Edgerton approached this kind of humor in The Bitch, but Plastic cranks the slapstick to100. It’s more Beavis and Butthead than Three Stooges, but it also contains anugget of truth about human nature present in every Edgerton novel.The Genuine, Imitation, Plastic Kidnapping is the only novel that, genuinely, made me laugh out loud.It somehow turned a forced amputation into one of the most hilarious scenesI’ve ever read. That takes some doing.Interview- 12 Rounds with Les Edgerton Les Edgertonis one of the most capable crime writers alive, which should come as nosurprise to anyone familiar with his background. Edgerton makes no bones abouthis criminal history, which eventually landed him a stint in prison. That kindof frankness makes him one of the best interviewees around.Edgerton’s latest novel, The Genuine, Imitation, Plastic Kidnapping, made my shortlist of the best reads of 2014. At the end of thenovel, Edgerton leaves the reader with personal notes outlining thetrue-to-life events that inspired the novel. I couldn’t resist picking hisbrain.Q: I look at KIDNAPPING as THEBITCH 2.0 in that the cons and humor in the latter are amplified in theformer. Did you write KIDNAPPING with THE BITCH in mind?A. Not at all. Actually, I wroteKIDNAPPING many years before I did THE BITCH. If there are similarities, it’sonly because my mind and world-view works fairly consistently.Q: Your notes at the end of thenovel say that KIDNAPPING is your way of getting back to writing \"simplyto entertain and get a laugh from readers.\" What were you burnt out onthat you needed to get back to that?A. Just unrelenting seriousness inthe last few books I published. Just thought it was time for a few chuckles.It’s the original reason I began writing as a tyke in short pants—to entertain.Well, and to score chicks, but that doesn’t always work out the way you hope itdoes.Q: You wrote a screenplay version ofKIDNAPPING. What's the status on that?A. Same as ever, I guess. Justhoping someone asks to see it. It’s listed on InkTip and that’s about it. I getlooks at the logline and sometimes at the script, but so far nothing much hashappened. That’s my fault, I know. It’s just too energy-draining to keep tryingto market things and I’d rather spend the time writing. Hollywood’s a youngperson’s game, totally. Over the age of about 35, it’s pretty well over as faras pitching stuff yourself. It’s really a matter of somehow getting the rightperson to read it. And, the “right person” means an A-List actor or directorwho sees it as something that can help their career. I keep thinking that thereare a few folks out there who if they ever got to read it would be interested.People like Woody Harrelson and the guy who plays Charlie on “It’s Always Sunnyin Philadelphia” would be the perfect pair as Pete and Tommy, for instance. Ifanyone knows them I’d love to get the script into their mitts. I don’t know whoI see playing Cat—she’s honestly better looking and sexier than any actress Ican think of off the top of my head. But, I think whoever played her would findit a star-making role.Q: You confess to taking part inprostitution in the novel's notes. Not as a john or pimp, but as a passiveparticipant of the \"services rendered.\" Any concerns about stickingthat into the public eye?Nah. I’m no longer a minister, sowhat would I lose? Come to think of it, I’ve never been a minister so I don’tknow what harm it does to have folks know. I thought it was kind of cool at thetime—I mean, who gets to cut coke lines, drink top-drawer booze, in a world-classhotel, watch a couple of world-class call girls work out and get paid for it aswell as taken out and treated to a fantastic meal at Gallatoire’s? Kind of thedream gig, in my opinion. I was also an escort for a long time for a top NewOrleans escort agency where I was the companion for older, wealthy women, andtrust me, that beats working on the boot line at the Goodyear plant.Q: The character of Cat is alsobased on a real person. You even used her real name. From your notes at the endof the novel, the character doesn't sound half as nuts as the real-life versionyou described. Any worries about that coming back to bite you?A. Hopefully. I miss her! I’d lovefor her to show up and take another shot at me—are you kidding? That was fun!She was without a doubt the most exciting person I’ve ever known. She was much,much bigger than any fictional character. Her mother sold her to CarlosMarcellus when she was 8 or 9 for a bag of weed (Mom was a junkie) and then Catmade the career-ending mistake of turning 12—way too old for this “Romeo” andhe turned her out. She went down to the Quarters and survived by prostituting,rolling sailors, dealing drugs, etc.—anything to survive—and I met her when shewas 25 and a top call girl. We had a lot of chuckles together.She tried to kill me a bunch of times and it was just plain exciting. Thatsounds probably worse than it was---each time, it was on the spur of the momentand she was over it quickly and we went on as per usual. I loved living on theedge with her. She’s probably dead by now—can’t imagine her still alive,although it’s possible, I guess. But, she doesn’t read much, so she’ll probablynever read the book. If it gets made into a movie,chances are better she’ll see it. She’s in my memoir, ADRENALINE JUNKIE,extensively, and if it ever gets published she might find out about that. HBOFilms wanted it a few years ago and were all ready to film it but the book dealfell through or it would have been out. The prez of HBO read it and said it was“…a PERMANENT MIDNIGHT, but with balls.” I think that’s high praise, but then Inever thought Jerry Stahl’s story was that big of a deal. If I’d grown up insuburbia and had an allowance and lawns to mow when I was a kid, I might have,but his deal seems mostly kind of “poor rich kid falls down and skins his knee”kind of hi-jinks. He spirals into the cocaine abyss because he was too smart tobe writing ALF? Cut me a break.By the way, I wouldn’t call Cat nutsat all. She always acted within the perfect logic of her personal experience.If she hadn’t been a little “nuts” she probably would have been killed yearsago.Q: Like your other novels, this oneis based on your past experiences, and you make that known in your notes at theend of KIDNAPPING. Given those experiences landed you in prison, were theyworth it for the sake of writing books later on? Would you change anything?A. Nope. Not a thing. It was allgreat material. Actually, I knew I was going to prison a long time before I gotthere. It takes cops forever to catch someone if they don’t want to cooperate,but I knew I'd end up there and it didn’t bother me at all. Now, after havingbeen there, I wouldn’t have been so anxious to arrive, but even so, it was allworth it. You can’t buy the kinds of experiences I’ve had—they’re priceless. Asfor the price of writing books, whatever that is—Faulkner got it exactly rightwhen he said: “The Ode On a Grecian Urn is worth any number of old ladies.”Perfectly said.Q: Does it ever rub you the wrongway to see other crime writers try to play up a tough guy image without havingactually lived it the way you have?A. It used to, but not really. Ijust don’t buy many of them as having much experience along those lines and itshows. It seems like it’s always a kind of a shuck—that they’re just trying tosell wolf tickets and anyone who understands “Jeff Chandlerin’” (a term we usedto use) knows these guys are harmless and fold pretty easily. When I seeso-called fictional “outlaws” hanging out in strip clubs and having all thesechoreographed fights it’s just funny. No actual outlaw hangs out in stripclubs—those are mostly for losers and wannabes—and I don’t know anyone whofights like John Wayne in real life and lives very long. I really don’t everwant to hang with someone who thinks strip clubs are cool or are some kind ofoutlaw milieu.I was lucky. I was an outlaw whenoutlaws were really outlaws. Now they all seem to be meth users and druggiesand those were creeps in my day. I’d be ashamed if I had to get drunk or highto rob a place—seems kind of sissified and punkish. We didn’t have all thesegangs in my day either—no secret handshakes and all that crap. Most jobs I didon my own and the only ones I ever had trouble on were done with others who gotcaught and then rolled over on me. Pull your own crimes and the odds of gettingcaught are greatly diminished. Some folks don’t have the balls to do that,though.There are so many untrue myths aboutcriminals. That you can’t make a living and will always get caught. Theamateurs do. The druggies do, I guess. I still know guys who’ve been robbingplaces all their lives and haven’t even sniffed a bust. It’s the same crapabout gamblers. I made my entire living as a gambler for four years and neverlost money. I’ve done things that are still open under the statute oflimitations I can never write about but know how to do things and get away withthem. I didn’t quit pulling crimes because I had some kind of come to Jesusmoment—I just plain don’t like the food in the joint or the restriction ofmovement. It’s a lot better on the bricks.Recently, I had this hoary old agentcontact me after he read my story in the Springsteen anthology and thought I had some “ability”and wanted me to send him some stuff. On a lark, I did, especially when I foundout he used to rep a former criminal we are all aware of. It got weird when heasked what I was writing currently and I told him it was about a hitman whomade all his hits look like accidents and this dude wrote back and said thatwould be impossible—that such a hitman hadn’t existed after 1977 (still don’tknow where he got that), and I sent him a clipping about a friend of mine—KennyVincent, the nephew of Marcellus who is an old friend of mine—who has“acquaintances” who do exactly that today. This old fart made the mistake a lotof people do—if it isn’t in their life experience they don’t believe it canhappen. Another “expert” who, as it turns out, is mostly impressed by his own,limited experience. That turned out to be the end of our correspondence—hedidn’t want to be challenged, I guess.Q: The \"N word\" comes up afew times in KIDNAPPING. You mention in the notes that a screenwriter youworked with, a black man, thought its use was appropriate given the context.Why'd you feel this was important to highlight to readers?A. Good question! And, I’m ashamedto say that I was probably covering my butt. Me, who hates being PC! We allhave our weak moments, don’t we? Actually, I don’t care if anyone was insulted,but my black friend assured me that there was nothing racist in it so… And, whydo we say “the N Word,” when it’s all right to say “honky?” It stands for“nigger” and that’s a perfectly good word. Mark Twain used it and he’s probablyour best writer. It’s just a frickin’ word. Where’s George Carlin when you needhim?Our language is getting horrible.It’s like the terms “invited guest” and “home invader.” That seems to be thesame difference as legal immigrant and illegal alien. Logic in language seemsto have fled the culture…Q: The message underneath the comedyin KIDNAPPING, at least from my point of view, is that what's important to aperson depends not on the who or the what, but the how. Perception is reality,and if you can manipulate how something is perceived, you can change itsimportance to a person or a group of people. Is that what you were going for oram I totally off? If it is, are you suggesting that most of day-to-dayexistence is the result of people conning each other, both legally andillegally?A. Great question! And, of coursethe answer is yes—there’s probably not a human exchange in any day of the yearin which both parties are completely honest and without an agenda. It’s whatbeing a human is. We’re all involved in a shuck with each other. We all wantsomething from the other person. The trick is to want something they want togive up. And, that’s just about everything. It’s an ongoing negotiation andgame, all the time. It’s what we are. It’s why we constantly go aroundproclaiming we’re honest to each other. None of us are. Outlaws are the mosthonest and preachers are the least honest. Whenever a guy tells me he’s aChristian and shakes my hand, I always count my fingers afterward.Q: You recently had a bout of COPDthat you said on your blog could have been, \"the big one.\" Given howclose to the razor's edge you've lived, does this bother you? In other words,of all the ways it seems you could've bought it, does going out with COPD seeminappropriate?A. Yeah. My dream has always been toget shot by a jealous husband when I was 99 and climbing out a bedroom window.COPD just seems so fucking inadequate.Q: What's the last movie youwatched?A. Can’t remember in a theater.Haven’t been to a theater in probably 20-30 years. I think it might have beenCITIZEN KANE. The key word is “Rosebud” in case anyone hasn’t seen it… Lastmovie I watched at home was one of my favorites, NATURAL BORN KILLERS. Woodydefinitely knows how to play a bona fide outlaw. He’s a guy I’d love to havebeers with but I’d make sure I was sitting with my back to a wall and had aweapon handy. Oh, and I just watched ONCE WERE WARRIORS which is one of myall-time favorites.                         THEBITCH: A Hardball Q&A with Author/Ex-Con Les Edgerton  Les Edgerton's The Bitch is one of the mostarresting crime novels I've read this year (no pun intended). It chroniclesex-con Jake Bishop's attempts to avoid \"The Bitch,\" a slang term for\"habitual criminal.\" It's similar to the Three Strike Rule. Jakealready has two strikes when a prison buddy calls him up for one last job.The yarn itself wascompelling on its own, but I suspected I was reading a story-within-a-story.Author Edgerton served time in the same prison as his Jake character. Hiscolorful past is already well-known in the crime fiction world, but I stillwanted to pick his brain. How much of the story was true?Fortunately, the authorwas more than happy to do an interview. Here it is, unedited and unfiltered.Just 100% pure Edgerton. Read the whole thing. His real-world answers couldput fiction to shame.P.S. Click here to buy The Bitch on Amazon. It's available at all otherfine e-retailers, too.BEN: It's impossible notto compare the lead character in The Bitch, Jake Bishop, to yourself. You both did timein Indiana's Pendleton Correctional Facility, for example. Was The Bitch catharic to write?LES: First, a small correction. When I was inprison, it was “Pendleton Reformatory.” Only, it wasn’t a “reformatory,” butone of the two Indiana maximum prisons, the other one being Michigan City. Theonly difference between them was that cons 30 and younger were sent toPendleton and cons older than 30 went to Michigan City. The “correctionalfacility” is a recent name change and nowadays they have a juvie facility inaddition to the main prison. While I was there, then-President Johnsonconducted a national study and concluded that Pendleton was “the single worstprison in the U.S.” And, it was. There wereeight riots during my stay, not including the one I walked in on when firstsent up.As to your question,Ben, writing it wasn’t much in the way of a catharsis at all. For a couple ofreasons. One, I’ve written aboutmy experiences there in many of my previous novels and short stories, and sothe “catharsis” value has pretty much been exhausted by now. And, two, I’ve neverlost a lot of sleep over my experience there. I was a criminal and going toprison is just part of the deal of being “in the life.” That “If you can’t dothe time, don’t do the crime” is pretty much the way it is. Just a part of thejob description. Criminals are pretty good at compartmentalizing things andwhen you’re in the joint, you’re in the “zone” and not outside, on the bricksin your mind, and when you’re out on the bricks, you don’t waste a lot of timethinking about the joint. I see a new breed ofcriminal today on TV where these guys are crying when they get caught. Whatkind of punk cries?BEN: One of the themesthroughout The Bitch was having to make a bad choice in the pursuitof something better. For example, kill Person X to save Person Y, yet create anew problem with Person Z. It's almost like the game is rigged. Does thisreflect your view of the world, that we're doomed to a certain fate no matterwhat we choose?LES: Ah! So you’re asking me if I have a Calvinisticview of life—that predestination thingy! Well, on Monday’s Ithink that, and on Tuesdays I don’t. On Wednesdays, I don’t care. To be honest, on mostdays I don’t care. I have a different vision of morality and God and all that.Most days, I fit the definition of a nihilist quite accurately. Expediency iswhat gets me through life. For instance, I don’tperform criminal activities any longer and it’s not because I had some kind of“come to Jesus” moment or some kind of epiphany. I’ve just weighed the prosand cons of performing a criminal act and since I’ve been there (inside thewalls), I have a clear idea of what that’s like and so far I haven’t comeacross a crime whose possible rewards outweigh the possible penalties. If I ever do, I’m prettysure I’m off that good citizen dais and out there doing the crime. But, it’llhave to be the perfect crime with an enormous upside. At my age, to go back tothe joint is a certain death sentence and I’m not quite ready for that.Incarceration really is a good deterrent once you’ve experienced it.BEN: On that same note,Jake is sucked back into the world of crime despite trying to get as far fromit as possible. Is this a fear you were exorcising through Jake's character?LES: Not really, but I can understand Jakecompletely. He’s the guy I could be if I had a moral view of the universe.Except, he’s really kidding himself that he’s a moral person. In the end, he’s asnihilistic as I am. Not trying to come across as some kind of “badass” hardenedcriminal type, but I really don’t feel like I have a lot of fears. I’ve donetime, been homeless, been shot at, been stabbed, had just about everything youcan imagine thrown at me and can never remember feeling anything at the timethan the same thing—that what was happening was interesting and would makegreat material for my fiction. Detached is the best wayto describe my feelings at any of those times. I’ve always thought “what’s theworst that can happen” in any situation I’ve been in, and never has that “worstthing” been all that bad. It’s the feeling I had whenI was in a shootout with what I thought were cops in a grade school and it’sthe feeling I had when my call girl girlfriend Cat had stabbed one of my othergirlfriends and was trying to eviscerate me. “What’s the worst that canhappen here?” In those cases (andothers) the worst was death, and hey… nobody gets out of life alive, so what’sthe fuss all about? It’s going to happen to all of us (death) and if youworry about it, it seems to me that you’re kind of… what’s the word?... oh,yeah… stupid. It’s going to happen at some time, so when it doeswhat’s awakened is a feeling of avid curiosity. What’s it going to be like?BEN: \"TheBitch\" refers to the slang term for \"habitual\" criminal, whichothers refer to as the \"Three Strike Rule.\" Wind up in prison threetimes, and you're \"out\" for life. Advocates of these laws say theydeter crime. Yet in your novel, it seems to encourage it. Jake will do anything- no matter how extreme - to avoid a third term in Pendleton. Which side ofthis issue do you fall on?LES: These “law and order” types—politicians and themedia, especially—don’t have a clue what deters crime. Or, rather, I suspectthey do, but their agenda isn’t to keep people out of prison. It’s to gainvotes for pols (for being seen as “tough on crime\") and for viewers andreaders (in the case of media.). It’s sexy and it’s popular to appear toexhibit the attitude of “lock ‘em up and throw away the key.” The things theydo don’t deter crime in the least.Here’s what deterscrime. Barber school. (I’m using this as anexample.) When I was in Pendleton, I had a much higher degree of education thanmost—I’d graduated high school and spent four years in the Navy and was aradioman and cryptographer. The average educational level of my fellow inmateswas about third grade. When most of these guys got out—and most do get out,which straights don’t seem to realize will happen—they have no skills to gainany kind of meaningful employment. Which means, they’ll be on the street again,with no way to gain money for a meal, for a place to crash, for any of that.So, they’ll end up doing what they know how to do. Stick up a 7-11, sell drugs,break into a place.Well, Pendleton at thattime operated under the philosophy of rehabilitation. They actually meant it.The barber school was the best “lick” in the place and inmates fought overgetting in. The reason was, the training was the best in the country and as aresult barber shop and hairstyle salons were waiting in line to hire us. On thebricks, a guy in a civilian barber school got to cut maybe 1-2 heads of hair aday. He went to school for seven months. In Pendleton, we cut 12-14 heads aday. For at least two years and often a lot longer. When we were released, wewere just far, far better at cutting hair than anyone else. Our services werevalued and highly. I had to field offers of employment from literally hundredsof places. Guys from civilian barber and beauty schools couldn’t buy a job.They took our leavings, basically.The result was, about82% of us stayed on the bricks. We made serious money and got married. Boughthomes, joined the Rotary, had kids and coached Little League. Why? Because wehad excellent jobs. I was making $500 a week in 1968, which was great money inthose days and it went up from there. Legitimately.And, as great as thebarber school was, it was virtually the only program in Pendleton that had thiskind of success rate. The reason was we learned a very marketable skill. Thesecond-best lick was the machine shop. Theoretically, guys could learn to bemachinists and go out and secure a good job. The problem was, the machinerythey learned on was outdated by at least 50 years and so the inmate who’d gonethrough that program wasn’t much better off than the guy who worked in thelaundry or in the chow hall. The barber school program was a huge success andshowed what was possible. Very few guys who went through the barber school cameback.But then… civilianbarber students started protesting that all the good jobs were going to ex-consand support for the program went away… Lock ‘em up and throw away the key…The thing is, nothingthe “authorities” do these days deters crime. I can’t think of a singlething. Warehousing criminals is the worst thing to ever happen for a lot ofreasons space doesn’t allow me to go into here. What’s needed is a realisticlook at criminals and prisons and the wrong-minded approach pervasive incorrections today, but that’s a pipe dream. Too many people making a lot ofmoney off crime and I’m not referring to the criminals.BEN: \"Prisonrape\" is often the punchline in a joke. The Bitch takes a different approach and details thelong-term psychological damage of rapes behind bars. The survivors might beprisoners, but they're still human beings. Is that a point you were trying tomake?LES: First of all, “prison rape” doesn’t go onnearly as much as straights think it does. It’s actually fairly rare. Ifone were to believe movies, books, and comedians, one would think it’s all thatgoes on in the joint. And, it doesn’t. In fact, in my two+years inside, among over 2,000 inmates, I was aware of maybe 5-10 suchinstances. There were more going on, I’m aware, but those were all I was awareof. This is one of the biggest myths perpetuated. It’s not a sexualthing—it’s a power thing and most often between blacks and whites. Whites don’t rape blacks as arule, but blacks will often try to rape whites. In their minds, shows they’rein control.I got hit on twice intwo years. The first was in jail, not prison, so only one time in prison. And,that came about after I got my parole and made the mistake of talking about it.(You don’t tell anyone as there are lots of guys who can’t stand it thatsomeone’s getting out and they’re not and they try their best to fuck up aguy’s parole.) A black guy got in my barber’s chair (a no-no—blacks don’t sitin white barber’s chairs and vice versa, unless one of them’s a punk), and toldme he was going to make me his kid. I’d made up my mind whatI was going to do if that ever happened and I did exactly that. Grabbed mystraight edge and went after him, trying to cut his throat. Chased him all overthe barber school and then Jonesy, a black hack, caught me, ran me into theoffice, locked the door, and took the black inmate over to his dorm. Jonesycould have written me up—and he should have—but he didn’t, which saved my lifeas I would have lost my parole and I knew if I had to do the whole five yearsof my bit, I’d have to kill the dude who fronted me and once I did that, I’d bein there the rest of my life. So, Jonesy saved my life, in my opinion.The guys who get hit onare guys who are all alone. In Pendleton, that meant guys from small towns whoweren’t career criminals before and didn’t know anyone. I was from South Bendand had been pulling jobs for years and knew everybody from South Bend and sohad all kinds of buddies who had my back as I had theirs. A good example ofwhat happens is one day a new kid came onto our tier from a smalltown—Tipton—and he seemed like an all-right guy, albeit naïve, and I kind oftook him under my wing. Well, a black dude started romancing him (although the kiddidn’t realize what he was doing)—giving him cookies, cigarettes and all that. I warned the kid that heneeded to get away from this guy, but he was convinced the black guy was justtrying to be friendly. He was. A week later, he’d turned the kid out. Big-time.Not just for himself, but he put the kid on the block. First thing he did wasget a ball-peen hammer and knock out all the kid’s front teeth. (Better forblow jobs.) A week after I’d tried to warn him off, the kid was roaming theaisles on movie day, giving blow jobs to other inmates for cigarettes andgreen, turning them over to his new “friend.” Sad, but he was too ignorant toknow when help was offered him.But, that’s where mostrapes come from. It’s just not a common deal at all. It wasn’t something mostof us even think about or worry about at all. Seems to happen a lot inmovies and in novels written by writers who don’t have a clue.All that said, I’ve gotrape in THE BITCH, don’t I! But, both took place in jail, notprison. One is far more likely to be raped in jail than in prison for severalreasons. One, many guys in jail haven’t done time so all they know is frombooks and movies. So, they try to imitate what they think goes on, especiallyblack guys. Not trying to come across as a racist, but it is what it is. Second, and moreimportant, guys in jail are hours or mere days away from being under theinfluence of drugs and that makes you do things and act in ways you wouldn’twhen sober. Third, often guys in jail haven’t made the alliances they will inprison and so are more at risk. Jail and prison are vastly different animals.Your original questionwas if I was trying to show that survivors or prison rape were still humanbeings. Well, not consciously. I simply assume they are (still human beings). Ithink a lot of straights think all criminals are rapists, child-molesters,serial killers and the like. The fact is, the vast majority of convicts areinvolved in crimes of property more than in crimes of person. Far more guysinside for burglarizing bars and gas stations, for stealing cars, for sticking up7-11’s, for check-kiting, for assault on the wife who they walked in on as theywere banging their best friends, than are in there for the crimes commonlyportrayed on TV. So, yeah; I think mostof the guys inside are still human beings. Books, TV and movies are all engagedin sensationalizing prisons and are a long way off from any accurate portrayal.That series on MSNBC is typical bullshit—if a person believed that show,they’d think most inmates are pumping iron all day long or are total nut jobs.Totally unrealistic show, but if they showed the boredom that prison trulyis, ratings would plunge.BEN: You're candid aboutyour colorful past, even writing about it in your bio on your website. Why? Asyou point out in The Bitch, people can react negatively to finding outone is an ex-con.LES: For years, I did just that—kept my past secret.Then, I got tired of listening to people who usually had it all wrong. Thetruth is, most criminals are pretty much like your average citizen. Not thatmany hang out in strip clubs, have tatts, use drugs and drink like there was notomorrow. Not that many have killed someone. Not that many have raped or beenraped in the joint. If you took thepopulation of the average prison and set these folks down in the food court ofyour average mall and dressed them “normally” I doubt if anyone looking at themor listening to them would ever think they were any different than anyone elsewho might be in the mall. In fact, the average citizen probably talks to anexcon every week and doesn’t have a clue. At one time, for instance, I couldwalk into just about any barbershop in Indiana and almost always someonecutting hair there would be someone I knew from Pendleton. The average lame whocame in for their haircut didn’t have a clue. Well, we’re out there in yourneighborhood. Some of us are workingin fast food, some are selling insurance, some are working on your car, someare taking your dry cleaning and handing you the pickup ticket, some aremanaging movie theaters… you name it, ex-cons are doing the same jobs andliving the same lives as anyone else. Remember, I was a college prof (stillam), was in college and elected student body president, worked as a reporterfor The South Bend Tribune, sold Prudential life insurance, worked as aheadhunter for an executive recruiting firm—in short, did a whole bunch of jobsthat, if you believed bad novels, bad movies, and bad TV wouldn’t be the case.But it is. We’re (ex-cons) are in every segment of life on the bricks and doingvirtually any job you can think of.BEN: Let's wrap up witha lighter question. What would be on the Les Edgerton sandwich?LES: A tunafish sandwich made with the recipe ofthis place I used to go to in Bermuda. I’ve never tasted anything like itsince. And, I don’t even like tunafish much, but this sandwich was awesome.Second choice, would be fried oysters.Thanks for having me on,Ben. This was fun!Well, there you go. Hope you got a bit of a kick out of these.Ben has the definitive book on guns and knives coming out from Writer's Digest this summer.

It’s a screenwriting book, butit’s very different from the normal mish-mash of such books and has tons ofwisdom that will be helpful to fiction writers as well.It’sJohn Jarrell’s TOUGH LOVE SCREENWRITING and I’d recommend every fiction writeradd it to their professional library.Here’sone example that, while aimed at screenwriters, applies also to fictionwriters:“Moderncinematic storytelling has evolved into lightning-quick cuts and tightly framedvisuals, shortcuts which compress and collapse screen time with a maximum ofbrevity while still managing to impart the essential content.This is also how we live our lives now—inshorthand.All our mind-bending new tech reflects the same dynamic and reinforces  these same expectations. Net-consciousnessdominates, dots connect at light speed. People process twice the same infothree times as quickly. Readers and audiences not only “get it” faster, theybring shorter attention spans, amplifying their impatience. Bore folks for aninstant, the channel’s been changed, a fresh Chrome window’s been opened andthe app closed out.Whichis why your screenplay needs to be stylistically in synch with these same timesand expectations as well.”Ina nutshell, this also describes contemporary fiction techniques.Thebook is chockful of this kind of practical wisdom. Jarrell shows the reader allthe mistakes he made and how to avoid ‘em. What’s really cool about what hesays is that he’s a working screenwriter who’s sold tons of stuff to thestudios. There are an awful lot of books out there written by folks who’venever sold a blessed thing and yet somehow they get bunch of people to purchasetheir so-called “wisdom.” Not this guy. He’s the real deal.Here’sanother gem that struck a chord in me as I’d just written a blogpost about thevery same thing. Jarrell is describing a process he went through to get the right agent… not just any agent, which is precisely what I’djust written about.Hesays:“Coupleweeks flew by before our follow-up. Agent Two told me he’d enjoyed the script,and from his brief notes I could tell he’s actually read it—even more miraculous than the first call-back. In allhonesty, though, Agent Two had another client sharing somewhat of the samecreative wheelhouse, and servicing one writer coloring outside the traditionallines was already a handful as it was.Thisshit happens. Agents don’t need many duplicate clients on their rosters,meaning writers working within the same specific genres or overlapping in thetype of material they write. Agent Two was totally cool and gave it to mestraight, like an adult—which, at the end of the day, is all any writer canhope for. Very warmly, I thanked him for taking the time.”Thishit home. It was exactly what I had said about a week ago in the post about whyLee Child and Matt Hilton don’t share the same agent and shouldn’t, even thoughboth of them feature the same kind of series character. For me, this bespoke aguy who understands the business.Thereare tons and tons of other practical and useful advice within these pages. Jarrell’s the real deal and his book is one of those rare things—a compendium ofthoroughly useful and usable advice.I’dget it if I were you. I think you’ll find it to be one of the best investmentsin your craft you’ve ever made. Either as a fiction writer or a screenwriter.Or both.Blueskies,LesP.S. Full disclosure--After reading his book, I asked John to take a look at one of my scripts to see if he can help me with his script consulting service. I've passed on these for a long time, but I never had the full trust that I'd encounter a guy with fully-operational bullshit detector before him. Check him out on his blog.

{"title": "The \"logic\" of obtaining an agent is sometimes flawed...", "date": "Monday, December 15, 2014", "text": "Hi folks,I recently got an email from awriter friend of mine who’s been struggling to get one of his novels repped andpublished. It occurred to me when I was answering him that this might perhapsbe instructive to other writers who find themselves in similar straits so Ithought I’d share my comments and see what you folks thought.First, here’s what my buddy said:Hey Les,Hope this finds you well.Christmas is just around the corner, I'm taking vacation, and planto be inebriated for as long as my wife will allow.It dawned on me the other day that I finished the first draft ofthe manuscript I sent you a year ago this month.It’s been rejected so many times I'm about to blow my head off -not a good thing to do at Christmas time.Gets blood all over the decorations.  This last rejection comes from John Gilstrap's agent.I write the same kind of stuff he does, so I am without aclue. I've decided to take a different path regarding the novel. I want you to know I appreciate that you thought to showthe manuscript to your agent, but I think that will just produce the sameresult. What's Einstein's definition of insanity?   So please don’t spend your time chasing that down.No need to do that now. I am going to publish it through Amazon and see what happens.Sure can't do any worse than I am at present. Thanks again for your support and your offer, Les.Can't wait to meet you in the flesh.Me thinks there are many beers waiting for us in N. Carolina. Have a great Christmas, and congrats again on the Keynote gig. Best Regards,______ PS. Know a good editor?Matt Hilton who writes a kick-ass ex-military character and doesn't share Lee Child's agent... Here’s what I told him:Hi ___________,Some thoughts on your notes...One, look at the position ofGilstrap's agent... if your work is similar, that really puts him in a bindwith editors, no? I mean, he's got to look and figure out which author he wantsto send the editor he sells John to and who he sends you to. It can't be both ofyou and I imagine his loyalty will be with the guy who's been paying his billsto date. It seems logical on the surface to have the same agent as a writer whoyou're similar to, but actually, I don’t think that's a good thing. Make sense?It's like Lee Child's agent taking on Matt Hilton who has a somewhat similarseries character--who is he going to be pushing with Random House? See how Ithink you've been shooting yourself in the foot perhaps? I'd look for the agentwho DOESN’T rep someone like Gilstrap or yourself. Then, YOU become THE GUY hetakes to editors. No agent with a brain is going to try to corner the market onall the ex-military superhero characters--that would simply becounterproductive.What does perhaps make better senseis for the agent to go to the editor or house that publishes work like both of yours.Makes better sense I think than trying to get the agent who reps two similarwriters and then try to decide who he’s going to promote to that publisher.Instead of pubbing it yourself, Ithink I'd look for an agent who doesn't represent a writer too much likeyourself. If you look at the lists of successful agents, often you’ll find afairly large disparity between the kinds of writers they represent. They’ve gottheir guy who writes thrillers, their guy who writes cozies, their gal whowrites romances, their guy who writes westerns… and so on. There’s no or little competition within the agency for which author the agent is going to bechampioning for a particular genre of novel. And, that just makes sense to me. Sometimes, I think a writer who is with an agent who has several like writers doesn't realize he may be getting shortchanged when it comes time for his agent to approach publishing houses... might the agent perhaps be pushing someone else within the agency at the expense of himself? Interesting question...If it helps, I've made exactly thesame mistake in my own past. For instance, years ago, I queried David Sedaris' agent formy Kidnapping novel--thinking Sedaris is a funny guy and my novel is funny,so... twisted logic as it turns out! He doesn't want another Sedaris--he's alreadygot the master! What in the world would he do with me? It was a realeye-opener.Blue skies,LesSometimes,what seems “logical” is anything but. I’d love to hear your thoughts on this.Do you think a writer should seek out the agent who reps the writer most likehimself? Or, is this kind of thinking flawed? I’d really be curious as to whatagents think about this!MerryChristmas!LesP.S. Just made another \"best of\" list for THE BITCH! http://thegamblersnovel.com/2014/12/15/my-top-ten-reads-of-2014/"},

Really thought this was the big one, Elizabeth! But, turns out I'm too ornery, so bad news for some, good news for others. Anyway, as so often happens along with bad news comes a ray of sunshine. Just notified that my Snippet version of Finding Your Voice is out and for sale for the ridiculously low price of only $1.99.A snippet is a new form of book and I'm very lucky my agent came up with it for me. What it is, they take an existing book and create a good-sized excerpt of it (an abridged version as it is) and interspersed within the pages are snippets of me on camera explaining and amplifying the points in the text. It's really kind of exciting to watch, imo. We tried very hard to get it out in time for the Christmas market and so if you want to glom onto a copy for yourself or for a gift, just go to https://thesnippetap­p.com/web/writers/Les­Edgerton and glom onto it. (Just kind of ignore the ugly dude speaking...)  Depending on feedback, we're thinking of doing other books in this format. I think it's going to be a winner and it'll be a form you can consider yourself for your own work. It really shows how the publishing community is continuing to think outside the box and really brings books to a new and up-close-and-personal level.If you grab one and like the idea, please let me know. Your feedback is really important to me. Thanks for considering buying a copy. Keep it in mind for those always-needed stocking stuffers.Blue skies,Les"},

This is what I looked like just before I left and was looking at the bottom of a Jack Daniels' bottle (courtesy of Jack Getze--no relation to the other Jack...). I had a magical time. One of my best friends ever, author Jack Getze, picked me up at LAX and we drove to his condo in West Hollywood where we stayed the first night. The next day, we spent nineteen hours on the freeway driving to the convention in what in Ft. Wayne would be a twenty-minute drive. Well, maybe it didn't take nineteen hours but it mostly felt like it...Once at the Hyatt, we checked into the room Jack provided and let me stay in. If not for Jack, there's no way I could have afforded the convention. Not to mention, I wouldn't have had a tenth the fun!And then... first things first... to find the bar. Which didn't open until 2 pm. Two pm! For a writer's convention! Who plans these things??!!Just a few minutes ago I tried to download my camera and found out I couldn't. I'll get my son Mike to figure it out and then post those photos. But, until then, here's a shot of my panel. From L-R, Tim O'Mara, Sara J. Henry, Bill Loehfelm, Hilary Davidson, yrs truly, and Joe Clifford.And, here's a shot of me reading some stuff at Eric Beetner's Noir at the Bar event. Will try to see if I can find a shot of me reading at Dana King's event. Wait! The shot of me in the mask was during Dana's Noir at Breakfast readings!And here I am with the infamous Anonymous 9...And, a shot of one of my publishers, Jon Bassoff of New Pulp Press...And, one of my biggest literary heroes, Duane Swierczynski...Got to meet Duane and act like a fanfool, and was able to give him a copy of The Rapist to get on his radar a bit and to suggest that he let his grandma read it...Saw Katee Sackoff... yeah... And, then... on Sunday, Jack and I spent half the day on the set of Girl Flu, starring Katee Sackoff (above), courtesy of Jill Flanders and her mom, my buddy Carson Flanders and Jill's boyfriend, Jay, the producer. Met a cool guy there, the assistant to the director, Orson Ossman, who was named after Orson Welles. With a background like that, a guy has no choice but to become a filmmaker... Above shot of cast and part of the crew of Girl Flu... And got to talk a lot with the mom (above) of the co-star, Jade Pettyjohn.Met just lots and lots of old friends and made cool new friends. Watched part of the Notre Dame game with Craig Fenech, a baseball agent and ND grad. Had to leave when the Irish were still up to attend the panel of my former writing student and now super literary star Meagan Sampson, only to return and find out they blew the game... That's when the bottle of Jack really got hit...Met just all kinds of folks. Robert Gussin, the publisher of Oceanview who invited me to send him my next thriller (yes!), Elizabeth Kracht, uber-agent, Dave Zeltzerman (in person--we already knew each other online), and a bunch of others. I'm going to try to write more about B-Con tomorrow when my head has cleared a bit more and hope I can remember to mention everyone then.Had a really fun experience the first night. Met Bob Truluck and his lovely wife, Cornflake. We had dinner in the hotel with Jack and Carson and her hubby Paul. When we sat down, Cornflake fell onto the floor. Hard. Broke her pelvis and three ribs and punctured a lung. Well, not really, but she should have as hard as she fell.  Turns out she'd had three beers and said she never drank. Plus, her shoes were tied together. Some fun! And, I couldn't remember her given name--which was Leslie, a hard name to remember--but she really goes by Cornflake. And her husband Bob goes by Crazy Bob. Well, not really... but he should... They were truly a fun couple and I'm not being sarcastic at all. They really were!My Down&Out Publisher, Eric Campbell, went balls-out in doing stuff for his writers. He took a bunch of us out to eat at a barbecue place that was awesome and mostly ran and ran and ran--delivering books for us to sign at various places, manning the Down&Out booth and showing everyone what a whirling dervish in human form looks like.Among others, I met and gabbed with writers and other industry figures: Greg Randall, Janie Ghodosh, Charles O'Brien, Lindsay Faye, David Stout, Jacques Filippi, Mike Befeler, Sinclair O'Malley, Brian Sweany, Sunny Frazier, Shannon Baker, Reavis Wortham, Terry Irving, Robert K. Lewis, Dana and Corky King, Russell Lester, Rob Pierce, Gerard Brennan, George Mathews, Sandy Harding, and my new best friend, Lisa Fernow. Saw old buds, Todd Robinson, Joe Clifford, Tom Pitts, Rob Brunet, Tom Pluck, Charles Salzberg, Mike Monson, Sabrina Ogden (with lopsided hair...)Ed Kurtz, Michelle Turlock, Bob Rotstein, Scott Adlerberg and a bunch of others. I'm forgetting so many and I apologize! I'll try to remember the ones I forgot for tomorrow's entry.Missed seeing Jenny Milchman and Holly West among others and that sucks! I did get to hang out with my ol' pal Tanis Mallow and try to explain to her why hockey sucks... I think she won the argument. Tanis wins everything she sets her mind to... And, when I got home, I found an email from a writer I've admired forever, Brian Evenson, who reached out to me after reading an interview I did with Richard Godwin in Grift Magazine and my week is complete!Tomorrow, I'll try to add the folks who slipped my Halfzeimer's mind today and talk about what I actually got to do.

{"title": "My dear friend Bob Stewart has passed on--sad, sad day.", "date": "Monday, November 10, 2014", "text": "Hi folks,One of my dearestfriends, writer Bob Stewart, passed away last Thursday. I’ve spent the past twodays struggling with how I could best pay my respects to him and keep findingmyself without the right words. So, instead of writing some kind of effort atgreat prose, I thought I’d just talk about what he meant to me.Author Grant Blackwood and Bob at the WRW event at the Purple Sage Dude Ranch (I was taking the picture)There are people wemeet along the way that make an immense impression on us. People that are trulybigger than life. Such a person was Bob. A hugely gifted writer, he befriendedme several years ago and we became instant friends on the spot. A fellow Texan,it was immediately evident when you first spoke to Bob that he was a man whohad a heart as big as his home state. And, although possessed of a huge talent,he was totally without an ego. I can’t even begin to list his accomplishments—hewrote bestselling true crime books, wonderful novels, even wrote award-winningscripts for the television show that was a staple of my childhood—Gunsmoke. He wrote for nationalmagazines such as People, Time, Lifeand Latina. There wasn’t a singlething he couldn’t do and do well in the writing world. He even invented a newgenre—“feline noir.” At is passing, he had just finished cowriting a new novelwith our mutual friend, Carl Brush, titled TheYellow Rose of Texas.This past spring, I wasasked to be a presenter at two Texas events, the DFW Writer’s Conference andthe nine-day retreat at the Purple Sage Dude Ranch outside of San Antonio,presented by Writers Retreat Workshop, with whom I’ve worked before, led byJason Sitze and Gail Provost (widow of Gary Provost who began the retreats). Iasked if Bob could join me in presenting and both directors gladly agreed. Wespent the days in between at Bob’s home in San Antonio. Later, I found out thathe had planned to sell the house months previously, but decided not to untilafter I left Texas so we could stay there and hang out together. I only foundthat out by accident when a neighbor of Bob’s told me what he’d done. Typicalof Bob, when he did something for someone he never sought out any credit.We had an absolutelywonderful time. I went through a really bad bout with my health. Texas was atthe height of their allergy season and that, plus the intense heat, sapped allof my energy. When I got back home, my doctor told me if he’d seen me there hewould have immediately put me into the hospital. I lost over 20 pounds in aweek and could barely walk. Bob got me through it. Although suffering himselffrom diabetes and heart problems, he wouldn’t let me lift even my luggage,would drop me off at the entrances of places we went to and found parkingplaces and walked back rather than allow me to. I didn’t really know how bad ofshape he was in himself, as he never complained with a single word, but justwent out of his way to assist me.At the DFW Conference,Bob was a huge hit with his own presentations with a completely-filled upmeeting room. After the conference, we went to his home and just hung out,telling each other war stories. Mostly, Bob talked about his late wife Martha,his son Bob III, his daughter-in-law Kim and his grandkids, and his currentgirlfriend Dixie. He wasn’t a guy to ever talk about himself, but I learned somuch about Bob just from listening to him talk about his family. And hisreligion. He was an intensely religious, God-fearing man and he gave testimonyto that faith in his every utterance as well as his very example of how helived his life. Myself, I don’t know if I believe in the same God as Bob did,but if He exists as Bob firmly believed He did, Bob’s in a good place and wherehe deserves to be.We talked often on thephone before my Texas trip and about every week thereafter. And then, he didn’tcall for a few days. Now I know why. He’d passed away in his hotel room doingwhat he loved doing—attending a writer’s conference in Massachusetts. A mutualwriter friend of ours, Scott Morales, emailed me that he had passed away. Icalled up Carl to see if he’d heard anything and he hadn’t either. Weeventually were able to get in touch with Bob’s son, Bob III, and found out thatit sadly was true.That was one of thedarkest days of my life. But, I started remembering Bob’s indomitable spiritand knew what he’d say to me if he saw me grieving for him—I could hear hisbooming laugh as he’d grin at me and tell me to get off my butt and startwriting. That he was fine and in the home he’d planned all of his life to be inwhen his days ended and to simply celebrate life. After all, that’s what he’ddone all of his life—celebrated being alive and on earth and at work in thegrandest calling of all—being a writer.So, here’s to you, oldfriend—you may be temporarily gone from the physical plane, but you’re alive inour memories—your family and your many, many friends--and always will be. Youmade the world a much, much better place because of your presence and I’m avery lucky man to have been blessed to have known you as my friend.Rest in peace—you’veearned it.Blue skies,LesMe sitting on a rock, Mr. Spender, and... Bob! At the dude ranch just before we went in to chow down."},

LOVE, LAUGHS, AND CRIME IN THE BIG EASYPosted on October 22, 2014 by carlrbrush No novel ever deserved the “couldn’t put it down” label morethan Les Edgeton’s The Genuine, Imitation, Plastic Kidnapping. Thisblack comedy thriller will keep you laughing your way through your fear fromfirst page to last. Your guide through the amazing set of cons and mishaps isPete Halliday, a major league pitcher (for a moment) fallen on hard times andlooking for a score. Pete is earnest and funny and likable, but a more than atad gullible. His partner/buddy keeps dreaming up new capers. Pete keepsfalling for them. Complications ensue, and the results are bothlife-threatening (to the characters) and hilarious. The biggest caper of all isreferenced in the title, and I’m not saying a word more about it for fear ofspoiling everything. Read it to find out, and I’ll guarantee you’ll be ever andalways glad you did. Pete’s cup of coffee in the majors happens with the Giantsback a ways. It helps a bit if you’re a fan, as I am, so that when you getreferences to such as “Dusty” and “Kurt Manwarring,” you’ll know what ‘s up.However, it’s not at all necessary for understanding when and how the teamdumps him nor will it dampen your laughs over the couple of the incidentsleading up to the rejection.The opening sequence that occurs on“A Streetcar Not Named Desire” is an unparalleled original, even for Edgerton.Throughout, we get how deeply both narrator (and, we suspect, the author)understand and care about the wonders of New Orleans. Again, I will say nothingmore about the events and characters for fear of spoilage. In fact, it seemsalmost impossible to comment on Plastic and still keep the way clear andfresh for the uninitiated. I can comment on how deftly Edgerton integrates areference to his most excellent, must-read work, TheRapist, into the action. Again, you don’t have to have read TheRapist to love Kidnap, but if you have–and you should–you’llenjoy it all the more. I can–and will–also say that if you’re up for a lovestory between a witty, low-level crook and a loveable prostitute who togetherget involved in slapstick felonies beyond any pale whatsoever, you need to getthis one. You really, really do.   Made my day!Blue skies,Les"},

I knew that was true, but I didn't know why. At one point, I decided that it was time to go back to basics. To actually learn the tools, which it turned out I had never learned! Which is kind of shocking, but there it is. I don't actually remember where I heard of Hooked. I may have just seen it at the library. Now of course, I own a copy. I realized quickly that the novel I was working on would never sell. There was no inciting incident, no story worthy problem--just people doing things and acting generally grumpy. I rewrote it, found an agent, and my first novel will be released in February. (https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22010134-when-my-heart-was-wicked)I hope to give lots of author talks, and I will probably tell every aspiring writer I meet to buy your book. But before I tell others about how your book taught me how to write, I felt that I should tell you. Thank you. Sincerely, Tricia StirlingAin't that somethin'! I've just had a glow on all day. Thank you, Tricia!Blue skies,Les"},

{"title": "REVIEW--SCOTT ADLERBERG'S JUNGLE HORSES", "date": "Monday, October 6, 2014", "text": "Hi Folks,I'd like to recommend a fantastic book I just read, Scott Adlerberg's JUNGLE HORSES. Here's my review of it:  Review of Scott Adlerberg’s JUNGLEHORSESEvery great once in awhile, as a writer,I come upon a book that serves as a wake-up call as to why I originally wantedto be a writer and reignites that original fever. The first books I read thatexcited me about literature were novels that created entirely new worlds out ofwhole cloth. The Jules Verne novels, the Edgar Rice Burroughs tales, thestories set in places like nowhere on earth. And then, as time went on and Ibecame more and more inured into writing professionally, I kind of forgot thatoriginal excitement. Well, it was just reignited. I picked up a copy of ScottAdlerberg’s newest novel, JUNGLE HORSES, and instantly felt like I was 7 or 8again, racing through 10,000 LEAGUES UNDER THE SEA or TARZAN OF THE APES. I wasimmediately transported into a world that had never existed before and it wasjust plain exhilarating! This was a writer who was obviously the kid theEnglish teacher back in the eighth grade singled out when she announced to theclass that this kid had a wonderful imagination. Too often, as we get older andmore jaded, we keep using the same old settings and same old plots and when youhappen on a story like JUNGLE HORSES, it feels like it does when a Santa Anacomes down out of the mountains in L.A. and blows all the smog out to sea andthe air gets crisp and clean and your lungs feel like new.I’ll leave it to others to describe theplot, except to say that it involves a degenerate gambler, a weird sexual triadwith one of the players impotent, and an island that I think broke off from theisland of Dr. Moreau and drifted a few leagues away. And horses. It almostdoesn’t matter what the plot is—it’s a dream and you enter into it immediatelyand willingly. Because of its atmospheric quality, it will be tempting to callit a work of noir, but it has a higher and reaches it—this is literature andliterature of the highest quality.I’ll leave the plot details to the covercopy, which describes it as:Arthur lives a quiet life in London,wandering from the bar to the racetrack and back again. When his pension checkdries up, Arthur decides to win it all back with one last big bet at thebookie. When that falls through, Arthur borrows money and repeats the process,until he's in too deep with a vicious gang of leg-breakers. The plan to save his skin will take him far from his home, to a place where avery different breed of horse will change his life forever. I have no idea why, but the entire timeI was transported into Adlerberg’s tale, I kept thinking I was reading a storyby William Goyen. I think it was the voice he employed.I’m just thankful for coming upon astory that reminded me of why I wanted to be a writer. I feel like my own rootshave been rejuvenated. It’s a wonderful thing to be reminded of thepossibilities of story.Pick up a copy--you'll be glad you did!Blue skies,Les Hey folks,The following review just came out today from the Australian blog: JUST A GUY WHO LIKES TO READMonday,October 6, 2014Review: The GENUINE, IMITATION, PLASTIC KIDNAPPING by Les Edgerton From the back of the book:The Genuine,Imitation, Plastic Kidnapping is a mix of Cajun gumbo, a couple tablespoons ofkinky sex and a dash of unusual New Orleans settings. The reader follows thecomic mis-adventures of Pete Halliday, busted out of baseball for a smallgambling problem, Tommy LeClerc, a Cajun with a tiny bit of Indian blood whoconsiders himself a red man, and Cat Duplaisir, a part-time hooker andfull-time waitress. With both the Italian and Cajun mobs after them, a chasethrough Jazz Fest, a Tourette's outbreak in a black bar and other zanyadventures, all seems lost.My Review:An ingenious comediccrime caper that captivates, engages, and demands the reader’s attention. THEGENUINE IMITATION PLASTIC KIDNAPPING is, as the title implies, a story ofkidnapping that perhaps isn’t the real McCoy, attempted by a couple of armaturepart time criminals who blunder, battle, and somehow pull of a daring (andstupid?) abduction of a mafia boss. But wait, that’s not the beauty in thisbrutally brazen idea – the Mafioso is only part of the plan. Amputating hisright hand and ransoming it back to him is the idea – one that actuallyworks…for a while.  One of the things I really liked about this book was the factthat the central plot device didn’t deviate despite the bevy of criminalenterprises the unlawful entrepreneurs Pete and Tommy underwent. Pete gets leftfor dead, locked up, shot at, becomes instantly rich the equally broke and thengoes on the lamb from his bookie that he’s in debt to, all before the uniquekidnapping plan is hatched. It’s a great ride that only gets better. As if THE GENUINE IMITATION PLASTIC KIDNAPPING wasn’t coolenough in its own right, the endnote by author Les Edgerton paints thecharacters in a new shade of realism by virtue of their real-life counterparts.Wow – pretty much sums up reading post script. Feels good to know that the folks \"Down Under\" are liking it!Blue skies,Les"},

If you like crime fiction that crackswise while offering a peek into the darker recesses, this is the book for you.Bill Fitzhugh,author, PEST CONTROL, TERMINATOR and othersWhat makes this wild, wild tale sointriguing is the sense that it must be drawing on first hand knowledge.Edgerton's sympathetic tough guy narrator gives you an authentic-feelingglimpse into the unique logic of small time hustlers and born losers, withechoes of Ring Lardner and snatches of slam poetry frequently catching you bysurprise and making it that much more enjoyable.--Matthew Louis,founding editor of Gutter Books and author of The Wrong Man and CollisionCocktail.“The most unrepentantly funny crimecaper you’ll ever find between the pages of a book. Elmore Leonard, eat yourheart out!”– MaeganBeaumont, author of Carved in DarknessMasquerading as a novel, Les Edgerton'snewest gem -- THE GENUINE, IMITATION, PLASTIC KIDNAPPING -- is really adebauched weekend in steamy New Orleans, loaded with alcohol, drugs, whores,pistols, and a menacing bookie, all available for your personal and privateentertainment between the covers. Narrator Pete Halliday -- ex-con, gambler,boozer, ex-baseball pitcher and unwise wiseass -- takes us places most don'treally want to go, only to have the time of our lives when we get there.

Hot and sexy, a couple hundredthousand red hot little mamas, stepping out of steamy baths and showers, theirskin sticky from the heat, getting ready for Saturday night ...\" Everypitch Pete throws is a hair-raising thrill, a belly laugh or a clue to thewicked and violent puzzle that hangs over his New Orleans adventure.

Best of all, the comic voice of its ne’er-do-wellnarrator is a pleasure from start to finish.--Jake Hinkson,author of Hell On Church Street and The Posthumous ManTHE GENUINE, IMITATION, PLASTICKIDNAPPING is a dark crime comedy that will have you laughing from page one. Itcrackles with manic energy and mad thrills. If you're looking for a differentkind of edgy crime novel, this is the one to grab.--Bill Crider, authorof Compound Murder, Gator Kill andothers.Imagine Les Edgerton’s writing. Dark,despairing noir. Habitual criminals. Rapists. This is nothing like that. :Edgerton takes a break from The Bitch and The Rapist to exercisehis inner Westlake. A “no holds barred” and “What else can go wrong” caper witheven more laughs than plot twists. The Genuine, Imitation, Plastic Kidnappinghas a plot John Dortmunder would have trouble negotiating, and Edgerton milksit for all it’s worth. Not for the faint of heart, the crime that really setsthe story off involved kidnapping a gangster—no, I can’t do it. I don’t want tospoil even that much. Suffice to say kidnapping, sexual fetishes, forcedamputation, Tourette’s Syndrome, certain death, and one-way tickets to SkagwayAK are all played for laughs, and he pulls it off. Big fun. My daughterdescribed the movie Ted as “Really funny and wildly inappropriate.” It’s likethat.--Dana King, author Grind JointThe Genuine, Imitation, PlasticKidnappingis like the fever-dream of a two-bit conman who fancies himself a criminalgenius. Add in some seedy and saucy New Orleans locales and you’ve got a gumboof freaky sex, covert mob men and botched amputations.

A terrific novel, for thestrong of heart – and funny bone.—WarrenMoore, author of Broken Glass Waltzes.There is nothing quite like reading aLes Edgerton novel. His voice crackles with a lifelike intensity. THE GENUINE,PLASTIC, IMITATION KIDNAPPING is the most incredible, entertaining and detailedbar story you've ever heard. Reading it, you can't shake that feeling thatyou've living a special, unique moment where anything is possible, like thatnight at the bar.-Benoît Lelièvre, www.deadendfollies.comEarly Amazon reviews:5.0 out of 5starsNothingImitation here. September21, 2014 ByLiamSweeny Format:Paperback|VerifiedPurchasePete Halliday's got a hell of an arm...and a little gambling problem. Or is it a little 'getting caught' problem?Either way he's washed out of baseball, biding his time in the Big Easy,pulling jobs with ace fuck-up Tommy LeClerc.In spectacular fashion, Tommy blows schemes so clever they shouldn't be done.Like a kidnapping when you don't know whom the kidnapee is connected to. Butthen Tommy comes up with a brilliant idea; a kidnapping the likes of which noone has attempted before...... and maybe there's a reason for that.Pete's a likable guy. He just smart enough to realize how insane Tommy's plansare, too dumb to tell Tommy to screw off. And it's that inability that bringsthe feet of the whole New Orleans reverse nobility down on Pete and Tommy'snecks.The ray of dirty sunshine is Cat Duplaisir, waitress with a side of hooker.Pete falls hard, and she's a great add to the team here. And the ending? Guessyou'll have to read it.Overall, I love Pete's way of putting things. He's a narrating character that'sreliable, true to form. Edgerton pours this one from his fingertips; nothinggets you clogged in the reading, nothing keeps you from hitting the 'next'arrow except maybe sleep or a pee break (I don't even think I took a peebreak).I got an advanced copy, But I liked it so much, I bought the paperback. 5.0 out of 5starsKidnapthis book - NOW! September22, 2014 BySarahFaurote Format:PaperbackWow - here we go again. Les Edgerton isone of the best writers of our time. Once again, I have a reason to read. Thishilarious, yet serious depiction of clumsy criminals and the terror and messesthey run into is impossible to put down. This book explodes from the page andpulls the reader in. You will end up loving the main characters and laughingall the way. Les Edgerton writes from truth and grit - the kind of writing thatonly a writer with a mad soul and the life to go with it can write. I have yetto read a book by Les Edgerton that I regretted purchasing. You can't lose withLes Edgerton. Throw the dice and reap your reward. Hope you glom onto a copy and if youhave time, please leave a rating and review on Amazon—it means a lot for sales.Blue skies,LesMe, with my \"Happy Face\"...It's \"Launch Day!\""},

The first, for THE BITCH, iscourtesy of Brit author Martin Stanley in his novel-reviewing blog, TheGamblers.The last two are Amazonreviews of THE GENUINE, IMITATION, PLASTIC KIDNAPPING which is now available inthe paperback edition from Amazon and you can preorder the ebook version (to bereleased Sept. 30) from them also.The GamblersMartin StanleyReview:The Bitch by Les EdgertonPosted on September 22, 2014 4http://thegamblersnovel.com/Les Edgerton’s crime novels andshort stories have a rich vein of truth and knowledge running through them thatmost crime writers, even the most talented, simply can’t emulate. Which ishardly surprising considering that he once spent a couple of years in prisonfor burglary at the Pendleton Reformatory in Indiana. Even the most stringentresearch is a mediocre substitute for real life experience. And it’s this kindof experience that filters down through the bedrock of Edgerton’s novel, TheBitch, and permeates the actions of its two main characters, Jake Bishopand Walker Joy.The Bitch in this case is not awoman, but the nickname that cons and ex-cons alike give to the three strikesand you’re out sentencing structure of the American legal system – the point atwhich prisoners become ha-bitch-ual offenders and go inside for the restof their lives.At the start of The Bitch, aftera second stint in jail, Jake Bishop is a reformed character working as ahairdresser and dreaming of opening up his own salon with his pregnant wife,Paris. The trouble starts when he takes a phone call from Walker Joy, his one-timecellmate, to whom he owes a very big favour, begging for help: bygetting him out of a jam with a dodgy jeweller that he owes money to. Histhinking clouded by fears of The Bitch, Jake declines. He is then warned by thejeweller that he has knowledge that will put Jake inside for a third strike andalso intends to frame Jake’s younger brother for a recent burglary of hispremises. Jake is left with no choice but to take the job on.The job is to steal a few veryspecial stones from a jewellery designer who is away for the weekend, but therewill be a lot of other jewels in there too. If they can pull it off, the takewill be massive.The only problem is that, in truenoir style, anything that can go wrong does go wrong. Jake is left wonderingjust who he can trust, and just how far he can go to avoid the ever-presentthird strike life sentence. Well, he goes pretty far, believe me, but to saymore would spoil things…I enjoyed The Bitchimmensely. It is written with skill and care by a writer who knows his stuffpersonally, and that comes through in the fear and increasing desperation ofJake’s narrative voice. Thoughts of that dreaded third strike are always on hismind, colouring his decisions, clouding his judgement, making him irrational –it’s an impressive piece of first-person narration. But it’s the plotting andorganising of key events in the narrative that impressed me most. There aretimes in many noir stories where events tumble into the protagonist’s path withsuch frequency that there’s always the danger of the narrative tipping overinto parody. Les Edgerton sidesteps these potential problems adroitly through acombination of fine writing and slowing the narrative down to allow thecharacters and readers time to draw breath. He drops a few twists along the wayto a really satisfying ending, in which he gives Jake a truly great line ofclosing dialogue (so good, in fact, that I wished I’d written the damn linemyself). If you are a noir fan, a heist fan, or a straight up thriller fan,there’s plenty in The Bitch that will satisfy you. Highly recommended.  Reviews from Amazon for THE GENUINE, IMITATION, PLASTIC KIDNAPPING (The first review from author Liam Sweeny first appeared on his blog.Customer Reviews5.0 out of 5 stars Nothing Imitation here. September 21, 2014  By LiamSweeny Format:Paperback|Verified PurchasePete Halliday's got a hell of an arm... and a littlegambling problem. Or is it a little 'getting caught' problem? Either way he'swashed out of baseball, biding his time in the Big Easy, pulling jobs with acefuck-up Tommy LeClerc.In spectacular fashion, Tommy blows schemes so clever they shouldn't be done.Like a kidnapping when you don't know whom the kidnapee is connected to. Butthen Tommy comes up with a brilliant idea; a kidnapping the likes of which noone has attempted before...... and maybe there's a reason for that.Pete's a likable guy. He just smart enough to realize how insane Tommy's plansare, too dumb to tell Tommy to screw off. And it's that inability that bringsthe feet of the whole New Orleans reverse nobility down on Pete and Tommy'snecks.The ray of dirty sunshine is Cat Duplaisir, waitress with a side of hooker.Pete falls hard, and she's a great add to the team here. And the ending? Guessyou'll have to read it.Overall, I love Pete's way of putting things. He's a narrating character that'sreliable, true to form. Edgerton pours this one from his fingertips; nothinggets you clogged in the reading, nothing keeps you from hitting the 'next'arrow except maybe sleep or a pee break (I don't even think I took a peebreak).I got an advanced copy, But I liked it so much, I bought the paperback. 5.0 out of 5 stars Kidnap this book - NOW!

{"title": "OFF-FIELD VIOLENCE IN THE NFL", "date": "Monday, September 22, 2014", "text": "Hi folks,Unless you haven’t ventured outside yourcave in the past week or so, you’ve seen a kazillion stories and opinion pieceson the child abuse and spousal/female abuse featuring NFL players. All of thisfuror reminded me of an experience I had a long time ago when I lived in NewOrleans.At the time, I was the styles directorof one of the town’s leading salons, Snobs. Among my clientele were a number ofSaints players, coaches, cheerleaders and others associated with the team. Oneof my favorite clients was Shea Hill, wife of King Hill, the quarterbackscoach. Shea and King and I go way back—they were a year ahead of me in highschool at Freeport (TX) High School. King was our All-State QB and fromFreeport, he went on to star first at Rice University where he was named anAll-American, and from there to the NFL. Shea was his high school sweetheart, acheerleader (natch!), and they got married when they were both at Rice. Wereconnected decades later in New Orleans.Snobs was the “official” hairstylistsfor The Breakers, the cheerleading squad for The Breakers, NOLA’s entry in theUSFL League. It was a cool deal. The squad had 33 cheerleaders and before thehome games in the Super Dome, us Snobs folks would do their hair in their suitein the Super Dome and then go watch the game on the field—the cheerleaders hada bench behind the players’ bench and that’s where we’d sit. During halftime,we’d to back to their suite, fix their hair again, and then back out to thefield. Our payment was having the Snobs name and logo flashed on the Super Domemessage board during the game as the official hairstylists. Sometimes, we alsodid the Saints cheerleaders. Now, remember, this was in the days when folksreferred to the Saints as the “Aint’s” so it wasn’t like our prime spots wereworth anywhere near what they would be today.Enough background. One day, Shea Hillwas on my book and she was always prompt. Except this time. She finally rolledin, twenty minutes late, pretty well flustered and out of breath. She asked meif I could still do her hair and I said, sure, and she sat in my chair.First thing, she apologized for beinglate. Seems King was home that day and had planned to watch their kids whileshe got her hair done. Except, at the last minute, he got a call from theSaints office, ordering him to come in asap. Shea said the entire team wascalled, including coaches, support people, players, equipment manager… everyone.  They were all called out to Metry becauseof something one of the star players had done. Actually, he was more than justa “star”—he was the biggest name on the team and one of the best-known playersin the NFL. A guy who kept an apartment two doors down from me and my roommate,Mark Toal, during the season. A guy I knew quite well. Quarterback KennyStabler. I’d even been invited to his wedding just a few months before thisday. During the reception, we were yakking and I said, “Hey, Kenny, now thatyou’re married, can I have your little black book?” He just laughed and said,“No way, Les. Don’t you know a good player always has a backup plan? Well, Idon’t have one little black book—I’vegot seven… and they’re big blackbooks.”He wasn’t exaggerating. He was wellknown as a bon vivant, man-about-town, and always had dozens and dozens ofbabes trying to get him home with them to do the nasty. Well, we all did thatshit in those days so that only makes him a regular guy.I remember one Saturday night I went toConfetti’s, the hot club at the time in Metry (“Metairie” for you tourists…). Ihit their doors about one am—which is the usual lifestyle of native young NewOrleaners. The way it worked, is that if you worked a day job and got off atfive, you went home and grabbed a few hours sleep. Then, around midnight, yougot up, took a shower and cleaned up and then hit the bars and clubs until themorning and then went to work. That way you avoided most of the rubes in fromIowa who mostly followed their usual routine—go out until one or two ayem andthen head back to the hotel. The serious partiers in the Big Sleazy didn’t hitthe trail until one or two and then we just stayed out all night.Well, about the same time I hit Confetti’s,Kenny came in. When I left, around six in the ayem, he was still there. Everytime I hit the bathroom to do a line or two, Kenny was in there powdering hisown nose. When I left, he was both high and drunk. Kinda normal… This wasn’tthe first time I’d seen Kenny out and about…That day (Sunday), they had a home gameand after the girl I’d taken back to the apartment left, I turned on the game.It was all I could do to stay on the couch without falling off to watch thegame. Major hangover and massive weakness in all the extremities. But Kenny?Well, all he did was throw 4-5 touchdown passes. After each series, he’d goback to the sidelines, collapse, and they’d hit him with the oxygen. This guyis out throwing TD’s and I can barely hang onto the couch! Just a pure beast!The reason he got married, was one ofthe (many) babes he was dating was a former first- or second-runner-up MissAmerica, a former Miss Alabama, and she’d laid down an ultimatum—“Marry me,buster, or I’m history.” Since she was definitely a looker, he married her.Shea said the big brouha was over an“accident” Kenny’s new bride had just suffered. Seems they got into a little tiffand Kenny began smacking her around the ol’ condo. She made a run for their carand just as she reached it, he came running up behind her, shoved her into thecar and began driving all over town, smacking her the whole time. I believethere was some alcohol involved and most likely some Peruvian marching powder,and the way Shea described it, he’d really laid into her. According to Shea, theyended up on the Ponchartrain Bridge and then he hit her so hard she flewagainst the door and out of the car. She was in the hospital and the team wasgathered together to make sure everyone was on the same page with the officialstory. Shea said she’d been told some money would be changing hands with the abusedperson to make the story fly.The official version of what happenedneglected to mention he’d gone medieval on her or that they’d even had much of afight. The Saints’ version was that they were just out for a drive and he’dturned a corner too hard, going too fast, and she’d simply and accidentallyfallen out of the car. Shea said that’s why King had been called in witheveryone else--it was a meeting conducted by the team’s lawyers and other suitsto be sure everyone was on board with the “official” version.And that was the version that made theTimes-Picayune and the tube. Seems reporters didn’t bother to challenge thisversion or even question the physical impossibility of him turning a corner toosharply, being as they were on the Ponchartrain Bridge, which, last I drove onit, was a straight-as-an-arrow shot for 26 miles across the lake. Kind of hardto turn a corner on it, but that was mostly overlooked by the press. I seem toremember they ended up placing her “accident” at a different location so as toaccount for the “quick turn” bit.The point of this little story isn’t toillustrate that NFL players sometimes get violent with their significant othersor even their nonsignificant others. It’s what Shea told me next that reallydefined what happened.She and King had been together eversince high school—high school, college, the NFL as a player and now the NFL asa coach—and Shea said that they’d never one single time gone to a socialgathering with any of those teams during any of those years—high school,college, the pros as a player, the pros as a coach—where at least one timeduring the party some player or other had smacked his date or wife or whatever.She said it was always the same. Just a fact of life. And it always got hushedup. The press was well aware that this kind of thing went on regularly, butthis was in an age where teams were protected by the guys who reported on them.She said if the public ever got wind of what a lot of players were like, they’dbe horrified.This was in, I believe, 1984.Shea had her own ideas as to why thatwas. “Les,” she said, “I’ve lived with these guys most of my life and it’s easyto figure out. In fact, King is one of the few guys I’m aware of who never hithis wife—me—but he’s not that way and besides, he knew if he ever touched me Iwould be gone so quick his head would spin.“But,” she said, “It’s fairly common.It’s because of the culture. All of their lives, they’ve been rewarded forviolence, beginning in high school. They’re lionized by everyone. Half of theguys I know from high school and college never went to half their classes—theteachers and profs would cover for them. It begins there and it just gets worsethe higher level you get to. In college, I knew so many players who got carsand girls and money and were drunk or high half the time. In the pros, it justgets worse. There’s all these groupies who hang out after the games to ball theplayers, married or not.“Well, what happens, it takes a specialkind of person to withstand that kind of hero worship. They get it from everyone. I’m truly fortunate—I’ve got aguy who’s got morals and a great sense of decency and treats me wonderfully andthere are others like King, but there’s an awful lot who aren’t.“And, when you’re God to thousands ofpeople—especially women—after awhile, you start to believe that you really areGod. I mean, you’ve got thousands, if not millions of people screaming yourname every week on game day and women throwing themselves at you constantly, andthat changes people. And after awhile, to little ol’ Mary Sue who married you, whomay have started out as one of your many hero-worshippers, but eventually,you’re not the demigod she may have started out thinking of you as, but justol’ Billie Bob, who she just wants to take out the garbage like any othermarried guy… and that’s when some of ‘em come unglued and can’t take it thattheir main squeeze no longer treats them like they can walk on water.”She laughed, a bit bitterly. “Andsportswriters are the worst. They’re the biggest hero-worshippers around. Theysee all the stuff that goes on constantly and it never makes the paper.”I can attest to that. I was asportswriter for a couple of years for the South Bend Tribune back in the latesixties and could tell you stories about icons like Bobby Knight, John Woodenand Cal Ripken that you wouldn’t believe and would call me a liar. Things Iheard and saw along with other writers, and we all kept it to ourselves.Nowadays, that’s changed, at least somewhat, but when I was a reporter in thelate sixties, all kinds of things went down with some of the most reveredfigures in sports.If I told you what John Wooden told asmall gathering of sports writers (of which I was one) at a private gatheringone night, when someone asked him what his secret was for winning nationalchampionships, you’d either call me a liar or simply be stunned. He swore us all to secrecy and said if we ever reported what he'd said, he'd deny it.Or, what I learned about the “saintly”Cal Ripken when I was doing research for my baseball history of Perfect GameUSA. I almost published it in my book, but at the last minute took it out. Iwon’t tell you, but it might put a dent in that “loves kids” rep that heenjoys.It’s just what lots of sports writers do—coverup for our heroes. Been going on forever, back to the days when Babe Ruth wouldregularly get drunk and pick up whores and it never got reported. Things havechanged somewhat these days, as today there are reporters who dig for the dirtand report it, but not nearly as much as people may think.Here’s what the lovely Mrs. Stabler hadto say about her “accident” from a newspaper account:The wife of former football starKenny Stabler said Monday they`re ``doing fine`` despite a night of domesticturmoil that ended up on police blotters prior to his induction into theAlabama Sports Hall of Fame.``The events sound exaggerated,``said Rose Stabler in a telephone interview. ``The problem was as much my faultas my husband`s.``Police said Monday that Stabler`swife called officers at 10:03 p.m. Friday from a downtown telephone booth andreported that Stabler hit her with his fists and kicked her before pushing herout of a moving car.Police officer C.D. Carpenter saidthe 27-year-old Mrs. Stabler did not appear to be seriously hurt and was takento a motel. ``She was just real upset,`` said Carpenter.But a second police report was filedby officer W.A. Cox, according to police records official Sandy Triplett, whosaid Cox responded to a call at 11:15 p.m. Friday. The address given was theHyatt Hotel.``He grabbed his wife out of thebathtub and pulled her to bed, where he beat her,`` according to the secondpolice report, which also said Mrs. Stabler had a bruise and ``an eye swollenshut.``Ms. Triplett said the police reportalso quoted Stabler as using ``foul language`` about his wife but did notindicate that any action was required by police.``It`s the kind of thing thateveryone that`s married goes through at one point or another,`` Mrs. Stablersaid Monday. ``Kenny and I are doing fine.``The couple appeared togetherSaturday night at the Alabama Sports Hall of Fame ceremonies, where the40-year-old Stabler was among the inductees. At the ceremony, Stabler praisedhis wife as an important part of his life.Police said no charges were filedand no further action was planned.Does any of this sound like any ofthe current stories circulating? A bit…I have one more Kenny Stabler story.A few years before his wife’s “accident”, there was a lot of publicity aboutSacramento Bee reporter Bob Padecky and the story he was preparing on Stabler.Word got out that it was about Kenny’s use of cocaine (which I witnessedpersonally, more than once…). Turns out, the reporter himself was arrested inGulf Shores, AL (where Kenny lived during the off-season), for possession ofcocaine his own self. Imagine that! A friend of mine was a NOLA sheriff’sdeputy and he told me one of his best friends was involved in the frame-up.Here’s the reporter’s own version ofwhat happened:Stabler and me, 30 years laterA lot of water has passed under the bridge sinceI was set up in AlabamaBy Bob Padecky,The Press Democrat Published: Wednesday, June 24, 2009 at 3:30 a.m.Last Modified: Tuesday, June 23, 2009 at 1:37p.m.BobPadecky has been a sports columnist for The Press Democrat in Santa Rosa, CA (sister paper of TheTuscaloosa News and part of the NY Times Regional Group) since 1987. Padeckywas the journalist involved in the infamous cocaine in a key case incident in1979 during an interview with former UA and Oakland Raiders quarterback KenStabler. Read a detailed Sports Illustrated account here. SONOMA - ‘‘So, how you doing, Kenny?”That’s the question I asked Kenny Stabler on Sunday morning at InfineonRaceway, and I had no idea what would happen next. The last time I askedStabler a question, he responded by using an action verb and the second-personpersonal pronoun and then walked straight past me on the Raiders’ practicefield behind El Rancho Motel in Santa Rosa.Of course that was 30 years ago and times change, people change, eventschange people. The dust-up Stabler and I had in Southern Alabama is ancienthistory for most people and I was curious if it would be the same for Stabler.I mean, after all, I was the one thrown in jail, not Stabler.During NASCAR race week, a Stabler representative had called Infineon andasked if the track’s local paper, The Press Democrat, would do a story on theformer NFL MVP. The very competent John Cardinale, Infineon’s vice president ofcommunications and marketing, who I bet could get an interview with Osama binLaden if I asked real nice, said the reporter most likely to do the interviewwould be me.Go check with Stabler first, John suggested. A few minutes later Stabler’srepresentative called back and said the former Raiders quarterback would not bedoing the interview.In the interim, Cardinale had told me, Stabler was supplying nearly everyBay Area TV and radio station with interview upon interview, filling up everysecond with charming, insightful, humorous anecdotes and opinions about theRaiders and Al Davis. That’s the way I remember Stabler as well before Jan. 22,1979.I had flown from Miami, the site of the Super Bowl that year, to Pensacola,Fla., and then driven to Gulf Shores, Ala., to do an interview at Stabler’srequest. Three weeks earlier, I had been in Gulf Shores for a day and a half,interviewing local people for the Sacramento Bee on what they thought ofStabler’s mediocre 1978 season. I had wanted to talk to Stabler.He had stopped talking during the season, said he would talk after theseason, and so there I was, ready to chat. I was naïve, as I look back on it. Ithought he would.Stabler said no thanks. He also said he really wished I wouldn’t go to hishometown. I did, writing a three-part series for The Bee as a result. I thoughtit was a fair treatment and not very inflammatory. His homies weredisappointed, not happy, guessed he might have partied a bit much, but theyweren’t ready to send Stabler out of town in a pine box either. Stabler was angry, however. That’s what he told me at the third restaurantin which I met him that day in Gulf Shores. He pounded the table, using a voicein a borderline scream, and said we would have to find another restaurant to dothe interview.That’s when I suspected something funky was up. We already had been to tworestaurants and neither one was suitable for an interview. This thirdrestaurant did not have a view on my rental car.What happened in the following minutes and months will be condensed considerably.I pulled out of the restaurant parking lot and onto the highway, and washemmed in by two police cars and a motorcycle policeman. I was searched andplaced in handcuffs while a cop went to my left front fender and pulled amagnetic key case from inside the wheel well. The key case contained cocaine.I was thrown in jail, then taken from jail to my hotel room, where we waitedfor the bad guys who planted the cocaine. The bad guys never came. I was givena two-car police escort to the Pensacola airport, entering the Eastern Airlinespassenger jet with armed officers on both my left and my right. The passengerslooked at me like I was John Dillinger.I wrote a story about it for both the Miami Herald and the Bee. As a result,the NFL, the FBI and the state of Alabama investigated. After all, cocaine hadbeen found. No one was arrested, although I imagine it wasn’t a pleasant timefor Stabler.Attorney Leigh Steinberg contacted me and after some discussion withHollywood said Michael Douglas was interested in doing a movie and John Belushiwas going to play yours truly.All I needed to do was sign off on it. I didn’t. I didn’t want this story toturn into a “Smokey and the Bandit” remake. Stabler told me to buzz off thefollowing training camp. That’s the nut of it.Thirty years passed. I must admit I was probably as interested in talkingwith Stabler again as he was with me. Torches were being carried. Then EricBranch of The Press Democrat’s sports staff said something last week thatstruck home. “Stabler should get over it,” Eric said. “It’s been 30 years afterall.”And, I thought, so should I.Thirty years have passed. I have made mistakes and lived through them, as Iam sure Stabler has. I have lost loved ones, as I’m sure Stabler has. I haveseen too many things happen too suddenly, not to know life can end in a blink;Stabler has had to see the same things. And the worst of it, for me, was ashort time in jail, while feeling I was in the middle of this really bad movie.“So, how you doing, Kenny?”This was an Infineon press conference, not a confessional. I wanted torespect the environment. I also waited until most of the questions were asked.“I have been good,” Stabler said. “Things have been good. It’s all becauseof my family. My three daughters ... Everything is going well for me. I amcontent with my retirement. I am content with my relationship with football.”I hadn’t expected him to respond with more than two words. He was civil,professional.As Stabler left the podium, I stood in front of him, extended my hand andrepeated the question I asked earlier. Stabler reached out with his right hand,shook mine and said, “I’m good, Bob. I’m good.”And then walked past me quite nimbly. He may have thought about driving astake through my heart. I don’t know.Wasn’t I disappointed that Stabler was so cordial? That’s what people askedlater. Surprised? Yes. Disappointed? No. All yelling does is make you lose yourvoice.What did I expect to come out of it?A curiosity would be satisfied for me: After 30 years, would I get thefeeling Stabler was still ready to pound a table again? Maybe. Don’t think so.Life, be it sports or otherwise, is a series of adjustments. I’d like to thinkStabler made his. I’d like to think maybe even Stabler was surprised he coulddo it. Who knows.But I do know this. When I reached my car in the parking lot Sunday after Iwas through writing in the press box, I checked under my left fender. Just tomake sure nothing was there.Bob Padecky has been a sportscolumnist for The PressDemocrat in Santa Rosa, CA since 1987. He previously worked at TheSacramento Bee. He can be reached at bob.padecky@pressdemocrat.comor through his blog at padecky.pressdemocrat.com The point of this isn’t to reaffirm thatKenny Stabler was a user and an abuser—that’s fairly well-documented. The pointis, what Shea Hill told me about the culture of football. What is revealing inmy opinion, is that she said this nearly thirty years ago and she was talkingabout a culture that had existed from her days in high school (late fifties).And now, folks are all indignant about somethingthat’s been going on forever. Kenny Stabler for sure isn’t and wasn’t the onlyone smacking around women. It’s just getting exposed a little. And, I don’t seeit as a racial thing at all—Kenny’s about as white as one could be—looks to meas if it’s a cultural thing—sports culture…A bit late in the day… but at least it’scoming to the light of day. If folks think these are isolated cases, they’revery wrong.Blue skies,LesP.S.

Parker’s WILDERNESS.Fiona: Are there any new authors thathave grasped your interest?A boatload. I don’t want to leave anyone out so I won’tname them, but there are an awful lot of really great writers working thesedays. Probably more so than at any time in history.Fiona: What are your current projects?Selling my memoir, ADRENALINE JUNKIE and a new craftbook, A WRITER’S WORKSHOP AT THE BIJOU, writing three new novels, prepping fora bunch of workshops and conferences I’ve been asked to present at. Helpingkeep the stock price of Jack Daniels sufficiently high for investors.Fiona: Name one entity that you feelsupported you outside of family members.I’ve never been big on being supported by family membersso I’d have to say I’ve always been supported by my wits. There are a millionways to make money. I don’t need much—I’m comfortable with the rent paid andI’ve been comfortable as a homeless person. Especially in this country. Ourdumpsters have better food than most third world countries have for their mainrepasts…Fiona: Do you see writing as a career?Uh… yeah. It has been so far for many, many years and Iexpect it to continue.Fiona: If you had to do it all overagain, would you change anything in your latest book?Nope. That’s what the final rewrite is for—to make it asperfect as you’re able to.Fiona: Do you recall how your interestin writing originated?Yeah. When I read my first book and saw the possibilitiesin writing. I saw a way to take advantage of my adrenaline jones and get paidfor having cool experiences. Can’t get that selling life insurance…Fiona: Can you share a little of yourcurrent work with us?Here’s a bit from THE GENUINE, IMITATION, PLASICKIDNAPPINGBrightand early the next morning, a woman teller counted out bills, put them in anenvelope and handed it to me. I thanked her, stuck the envelope in my pocketand left.I was walking down the bank steps when two men came up, one abeefy mountain of a man and the other slight and smarmy. They came up besideme, took me by the elbows and hustled me down the steps. All three of us walkedto the alley beside the bank and went on back to a pair of dumpsters.The big guy spun me around and pinned an armlock on me. Thelittle guy snatched the envelop from my pocket, tore it open and counted themoney. \"Damn,\" he said, \"Where's the other five?\"I frowned. \"It's in the mail? You buy that?\"The little guy placed the wad of bills in his jacket pocketand nodded to his large partner who gripped me tighter. \"Wise guy,huh?\" the little guy said.\"Well, you wouldn't know it by my SATs. You know what?You look familiar. I got it! Your mom.\"\"My mom?\" the little goon said.\"Yeah,\" I said. \"Your mom. We been dating.Whenever I have an extra twenty. I just love it when she takes out her falseteeth. You know . . .\" I went on. \"I might end up your stepfather.Think she'd grow a mustache for me?\"The little guy hauled off and socked me in the gut. I collapsedand struggled to right myself and get my breath back.\"Yeah,\" I said, wheezing my words out. \"Youhit about like your mom. I can see you're related. I suppose you wanna give mea blowjob now?\"\"You fuck,\" the little guy screamed, and hit meagain. As I folded in half like a WWII Japanese foot soldier unexpectedlyfinding himself in the same room as the Emperor, the little guy grabbed my handand brought it around and secured it between his arm and chest. He bent four ofmy fingers back until they cracked. Audibly. Almost as loud as the scream Igave out, feeling like a complete bitch when I did, but couldn't help it.Fiona: Is there anything you find particularlychallenging in your writing?Nope. The biggest problem I have is that I won’t livelong enough to write all the books I have rattling around in my brainpan.Fiona: Who is your favorite author andwhat is it that really strikes you about their work?My all-time favorite is Albert Camus and what I loveabout him is how he lowers the volume when most other writers would raise it.He wrote books for grownups and folks who don’t move their lips when they read.Fiona: Do you have to travel much concerningyour book(s)?No. Don’t have to, but I love traveling.Fiona: Who designed the covers?Of my books? Well, the publishers do.Fiona: What was the hardest part ofwriting your book?There really aren’t any hard things about writing.Writing’s like breathing.Fiona: Did you learn anything fromwriting your book and what was it?I learn something with each new book. Actually, I learnmore from other writers and their work and then just apply what I’ve learned tomy own work.Fiona: Do you have any advice for otherwriters?Yes. I’ll echo what Jim Harrison advised—“To read thewhole of Western literature for the past 2,000 years… and then, if you livelong enough, the same 2,000 years of Eastern literature. For, if you don’t knowwhat passed for good in the past, how can you know what passes for good today?”Harrison nailed the secret of learning to write well—read, read, and then readsome more. And then write. All the rest is just noise.Fiona: Do you have anything specificthat you want to say to your readers? Just a sincere thank-you. And remember—Christmas is justaround the corner and an Edgerton novel makes the perfect gift…Fiona: Do youremember the first book you read?Actually, I do. It was a collection of short stories byGuy de Maupassant. Never did the Hardy Boys or Run, Spot, Run thing.Fiona: Other thanwriting do you have any hobbies ?Reading. When I’m not writing, I’m almost always reading.Fiona: What TVshows/films do you enjoy watching?Don’t watch much TV and haven’t been to a movie theaterin probably ten years. There are three things though, that I never miss on TV.Notre Dame football, Indiana University basketball, and San Francisco Giantsbaseball. Sometimes I watch the show all outlaws watch—Antiques Roadshow…Fiona: Favoritefoods / Colors/ Music Favorite foods are Oysters Bienville and OystersRockefeller and Marlboros. Favorite color is black (is that a color?). Favoritemusic is jazz and country. Old-jazz—no fusion, no electronic stuff--and oldC&W like Patsy Cline and Waylon Jennings.Fiona: If you were not a writer what else would you like to have done?Been anoutlaw. Oh, wait! I did that. Well, you can do both at the same time, y’know...I’ve also always wanted to be a stunt man in porno movies. It pays great, hasshort hours, and they never see your face. The only drawback is you have tolike large animals...Fiona: Do you have a blog/website? If so what is it?A blog on writing at www.lesedgertononwriting.blogspot.com/Thank you so much, Fiona—you ask great questions!Blue skies,Les"},
{"title": "QUICK FIRE AT THE SLAUGHTERHOUSE", "date": "Sunday, September 7, 2014", "text": "Hi folks,Today, Iwas honored by being interviewed by the person I feel is the single bestinterviewer on the planet these days, Richard Godwin, for his classy interviewsite, “Quick Fire at the Slaughterhouse.” It’s my second time I experienced aGodwin interview, the first at his “Chin Wag at the Slaughterhouse.” Simplyput, there is no one better these days at conducting interviews, and yes, I’maware of the Paris Review interviews. Compared to Godwin, those are closer tobeing quizzed by a People Magazine reporter…Godwinfirst included a review of my novel, THE RAPIST, by Vicki Gundrum. Here isVicki’s review, to be followed by the Quick Fire interview: Vicki's Review of The Rapist TheRapistByLes EdgertonNewPulp Press, March 2013ISBN:970-0-9855786-2-6Reviewedby Vicki LambrosGundrumLesEdgerton’s The Rapist lures through prurient interest of a heinous crimeand the promise topeekinto the mind of the rapist. It begins as smut, some pages feel dirty. Therapist, TrumanFerrisPinter, is unrepentant, even spiteful and arrogant toward those who would judgehim. He is a condemned man, sits in a cell awaiting execution. He recalls hiscrime and his hates, even aninfanthate. Complexity and contradiction nudge their way in. Edgerton tracks Truman’sthoughtsand dreams, which are unusual and particular—in this way creating an uncannyrealismofan individual mind. The book evokes consideration of art and life. It does notdebate right andwrongbut aims higher, toward the possibility of salvation.Therape lands Truman in the cell. The plot ends and the real story begins: theruminations of therapistand perhaps all the guilty soon to die who contemplate death. The book existsoutside oftime—inthe manner of a classic—no contemporary references plus Biblical-levellanguage. Forexample,here is the opening, a thought monologue by the rapist:Letme tell you who occupies this prison cell. Perfidious, his name is Perfidity.His name is: Liar,Blasphemer,Defiler of Truth, Black-Tongued. He lies down with all members of thecongregationequally, tells them each in turn they are his beloved, while he is alreadyattendingtothe next assignation, in his relentless rendezvous with the consumption ofsouls.Inthe cell Truman dreams and he begins to fly, adventures that relieve him ofprison time andplacehim in the condensed world of thought and visitations to his childhood when hecould truly hover above the ground, until the age of eleven. He suddenly lostthe power because he learned to fear, he had become an adult. The power to fly “insistson suspension of all fears and laying yourself open to the actions of others.Pure trust and guilelessness must be achieved….I suspect that is what Christ ismystically saying when he tells the Pharisee he must become as a ‘little child’again.”Trumanalso tells of his childhood power to leave his body and float above it, a poweralso lost atageeleven: “Unlike Christ at the same age, I felt no call to proselytize, my mainactivity at thisperiodbecoming an intense desire to satisfy my carnal nature. I self-abused my flesh,incessantly.”Trumanpractices flight in his cell and plans an escape. During practice he meets withhis fatherandmother, and then he’s in a dream that seems real and people run for theirlives. He alsodebatesa man in a robe on a mountaintop about religion, heaven, hell, humanity, love.Partwaythroughtheir talk the old man loses his smile, saying “Could it be that God has beenmisinterpretedby man?”Oneof the most virtuosic performances in the novel is the well-read and articulateTruman’s runthrough of religion, philosophy, psychology; God, Freud, Kant,Jung, Skinner, Einstein; JohnMilton,John Donne; prisons, the veracity of his own murder charge, and his existentialchallengetothe warden: “You are looking out of hell, not into it when your eyes lock withmine.”Edgerton,via Truman, proposes an original view of life and souls that reads like ametaphor ofstringtheory—but which was written before publication of the string theorists(revealed to me incorrespondencewith the author, 2014).Andin writing this theory of life—and Truman’s flirtations with destinations ofhell, nothing,strangeloops, or heaven—Edgerton seems to have written like his life depended on it.Thebook’sconclusion is a seeker’s twist that might not have been found but was.Itis a slim book—a novella (142 pages)—with a tightly woven narrative thatspringboards fromtheguise of pulp fiction to its destination as guidebook for lost souls. Therewould never be alovechild between Albert Camus and Harold Pinter (the original Pinter—theplaywright famousforhis comedies of menace) but such an invention comes to mind for the book is oneof a kind.Thebook satisfies the entreaty “Make It New” made famous by Ezra Pound.TheRapist isdifficult only if you are troubled by the grisly beginning or don’t want yourhead inthegame of thinking. The author will not strand you as a guide.Howelse to persuade you all to read it? If some nerd creates metrics for measuringthe amount ofbookper page—lyrical communication of ideas, inspiration, insight, brain tickling,suspense intheservice of story—this book would win. (Not that I’d want a nerd to do this. Thebest books,likethis one, are mysterious.) Can today’s publishing world of unjuried plentyspawn a classic?The Rapist is a work ofgenius. It is a classic work that should be read for generations.Thank youso much, Vicki! And, here’s my interview with Richard:Quick Fire At The Slaughterhouse: Interview With LesEdgertonPosted on September 7, 2014 by richardgodwinLes Edgerton is a highly versatileauthor who moves between genres. While known for his gritty and real crimewriting, he often challenges contemporary prejudice in his novels. His novels TheBitch and The Rapist are two great examples of this. Les met me atThe Slaughterhouse where we talked about fiction and ideology.Tell us about the progress TheRapist is making.If by progress, you mean sales, it’sholding its own, Richard. Which means—as it does to most writers—not nearlyenough!What has been extremely gratifyingto me are the reviews it’s been garnering from the people I respect themost—fellow writers. Their response has been absolutely wonderful and I’mbasking in it. These are the smartest people in the world about literature andalmost universally The Rapist has received raves.However, it isn’t in bookstores andthat’s not the fault of my publisher. It’s the fault of the system. My agent isworking very hard to correct that. He’s actively seeking a legacy publisher forit and has the blessing of my publisher at New Pulp Press—Jon Bassoff—in thisquest. As much as indie publishers have done for writers—and it’s an awfullot—they’re still hamstrung at gaining mass distribution and getting actualbooks into bookstores. Hopefully, that will change at some point, but currentlynot much headway is taking place. Also, getting a book distributed by Ingram’sand/or Baker & Taylor, is the only avenue to getting reviews done bywell-respected reviewers, such as the NY Times, LA Times, WashingtonPost, et al. And it’s only by getting those kinds of publications toprovide reviews or coverage that filmmakers ever find out about the book.And—face it—that’s the Holy Grail of most of us as writers. Indie books, by andlarge, aren’t even open to most industry awards, although this seems to bechanging a bit. (Not enough, nor fast enough…) To see our books make bona fidebestseller’s lists (not those sub-sub-sub-sub-set of some obscure Amazonrankings) and to get noticed by Hollywood is what will transform the indie sideof publishing and so far, mass distribution is the missing (and crucial)element.So, in answer to your question, it’smaking good progress in sales and exposure within the limitations of the indiepublishing universe, but not the kind of progress other books make which areput out by legacy publishers. If an indie can somehow figure out how to gettheir books in the Ingram pipeline and therefore on the shelves of B&N,that’s a publisher who’s going to rise up and become a major player in literature.My fervent hope is that publisherssuch as NPP, Down&Out Books, Blasted Heath and those kinds of magnificentpublishers can someday figure out a way to get major distributors and chainbookstores on board. Look at the lists of just these three (and at least adozen more) and Random House doesn’t even come close to the overall literaryquality of the books these folks are putting out. But, if they’re not seen, itdoesn’t matter. And that’s the shame of today’s publishing. They’re restrictedto the Intergnat. Not enough, alas.If I were an indie publisher, Ithink I’d be looking to band with other indies and trying to make a case toIngram’s and also to the major chains such as B&N to get their books on thebookshelves and get covered by the major media. As it is, most don’t have thefinancial resources to do it alone, but I have to think that if say five of thebest-heeled indies got together and presented a case for Ingram’s and B&Nto take their product and put it on the shelves and store it in the warehouses,a major breakthrough could be made. What keeps that from happening now is thatno one house has the resources to physically publish enough copies of the booksto make it worthwhile for Ingram’s or B&N to distribute or stock them ontheir shelves. I think someday a visionary will come up with a plan to organizea consortium that would take a book like The Rapist, print 10,000 copiesand then they’d be able to sit at the poker table with Random House and thosefolks and get books out to the buying public. That’s the major difference—thelegacy boys have the bucks to print a significant number of books, send them toIngram’s and made available quickly to bookstores as needed with the flick of acomputer button. If I was younger I’d try to do just that, but that’s a jobthat’s going to require enormous energy to get the right parties together andtalking.Just think about how much better anovel such as Neil Smith’s All The Young Warriors, Richard Godwin’s Mr.Glamour, or my own, The Rapist, would do if it was on the shelves atB&N? Hell, we might even rival those Fifty Shades of Crap books thatare on those same shelves. So much book-buying is done on impulse when acustomer browsing the shelves happens on a copy of a book, picks it up, thumbsthrough a few pages… and then takes it to the sales counter and the personstanding behind them in line spies it, asks about it and then buys his owncopy? Our books don’t have that chance… We can’t even finance our own booktours since B&N and other chains won’t order our books unless they’re inthe distributor pipeline. I think the key to mass market success lies in themajor distributors.There are small publishers who’vedone just this. Algonquin Books, Gray Wolf—there are several. The deal is, theypublished enough copies that Ingram’s could financially take a chance on themas could B&N. Their editorial acumen was good enough that the majorreviewers would also look at their books. I really think if a few of the reallytop indie publishers banded together and started out with a few of their besttitles, this strategy could work for them as well.But, then, maybe I’m just naïve…wouldn’t be the first time…How does it compare to The Bitch?Two entirely different kinds ofbooks, so probably not fair to compare them. The Bitch is a noirishthriller, while The Rapist is a more existential, literary novel. Forsome reason, I seem to have gotten labeled as a “noir” writer, but inactuality, I’ve only written a few novels that fall into that category. I’m notcomplaining! Just a bit puzzled. I do think what they each have in common isthat both explore and plumb the dark parts of the human psyche.As far as sales, The Bitchhas a more commercial appeal. Although both titles are examples of how toirritate the PC folks, The Rapist seems to scare away more potentialbuyers because of its title. I kind of figured that would be the case for both,but my contrarian nature basically said “Fuck it” to both sentiments. Ifthere’s anything I abhor more than PCism, I haven’t encountered it yet.Especially when it rears its ignorant head among so-called “intellectuals” and“academics.” More and more, I find a more anal group doesn’t exist. Freedom ofspeech and freedom of thought don’t seem to exist with these folks in any greatdegree. I used to teach at various universities and haven’t yet experienced amore restrictive atmosphere in any other milieu. In fact there’s a decided andvocal bias against thought that goes against the prevailing political mood andif you don’t subscribe to the ruling thought if you want to keep a job, youeither learn to simply keep silent or else say fuck it. I took the latter tackand that’s why I won’t teach in a university these days. They’re very rigid andvery close-minded. And, in my view, very ignorant.Vicki Lambros Gund, who wrote thereview you have here, presented it to two scholarly review publications and itwas turned down. The reason? The way Vicki presented it to me, they’re run by agroup of “feminists” who rejected it out of hand because of the title and whatthey supposed it was about. As you know, it’s not much about rape nor are therenumbers of rape scenes, but simply a look inside a person’s soul who wasaccused of rape. One might think that a group of people who are againstsomething like the heinous crime of rape might want to investigate somethingthat reveals the inner workings of such a criminal, but like most people whobelong to groups and live their lives by bumper stickers, that would requirethe process of intellectual thought and that’s a lot of work, I presume…Throwing a bumper sticker on their Prius and locking arms and singing Kumbayahtakes a lot less effort…Am I bitter or pissed? Well… yeah.Not because of my little book so much as I am in the general landscape ofliterature, especially in the U.S. I’ve found a much more open audience inEurope. Seems there are still large numbers of people there who actually enjoy seeingand considering other points of view. Not so much over here… at least among theruling class… If you think I’m simply being paranoid, take a look at most ofthe major literary awards. Most are given to folks who toe the party line. Kindof a circle jerk…Sorry. This is the reason I write. Ihate. A lot. And hard. I especially hate small-minded people who’ve made uptheir minds to become part of the herd and have sold their souls for thecongress of other small minds.It’s why I will always come runningany time you want to do an interview, Richard. You have one of the fewremaining bastions of free thought and free exchange of ideas in literaturethat I’m aware of.While political correctness isdriven by ideology, history evinces evidence of the lack of Art underdictatorships. Given that, do you think that pc is the enemy of Art?   I think a truer statement has neverbeen made! The destruction of freedom of speech (which is the directmanifestation of freedom of thought), is the biggest enemy of art that has everexisted, and this is exactly what PCism accomplishes—restricting freedom ofspeech. What makes it even more insidious is that many who find themselvesreacting to a political correct culture, not only practice it themselves butexert pressure on others as well. At least in an overtly repressive societywhere freedom of expression is regulated by the state, there exists a healthyunderground of dissent. In a society that has largely given itself over to a pcculture, Pogo’s dictum becomes the pulse of the society—“We have met the enemyand it is us.”As it pertains to literature, truthis central to the quality. There simply isn’t any way to achieve truth whenPCism is introduced into the formula. The basic unit of writing is the word. Ifwe begin to use words that are in existence solely because they spare someone’sfeelings—real or imagined—we’ve veered from that truth. Instead of the beautythat truth brings, we’ve created fool’s gold. We’ve seen the result of PCism inthe version of Mark Twain’s The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn. PCismhas reduced one of the great works of literature into a pathetic kind of HardyBoys crap. PCism isn’t something new. It’s justthe newest form of censorship we’ve had to deal with. Like many grandioseideas, there is a noble intent at the center of this outlook, but also likemany other popular notions, it has been perverted until it is the antithesis ofwhat it originated as. Being PC nowadays amounts to out and out censorship inmy opinion. For every writer like Bukowski, William Vollmann, and David Sedariswho breaks through and becomes a cult hero, there are hundreds of writers whoare being stifled, vilified, and destroyed, simply because they do not preachthe party’s message nor do they conform to the parameters set up by the PCfolks who seem to be in charge. Too often they are stifling themselves bytrying to placate society. What used to be considered simply bad taste nowadaystakes on a more sinister connotation and that is dangerous if we value freedomof thought and value the time-honored tradition of the debate of ideas which isthe only viable method for advancing knowledge and understanding. And, whichconstitutes true art.Plato himself spoke about politicalcorrectness in The Republic, when he said:“Then the first thing will beto establish a censorship of the writers of fiction, and let the censorsreceive any tale of fiction which is good, and reject the bad; and we willdesire mothers and nurses to tell their children the authorized ones only.” Howabout that.Author Gordon Weaver told me in aninterview years ago that, “If our special interest, as writers and/or editors,is the precise use of language toward the end of a viable perception of andeffect on reality, we may argue there is some virtue implicit in anyutterance (written or oral) that confronts the consensus of any gathering.” Hegives an example. “There is a cost that will be paid by all concerned if onetells a Polack joke in the presence of Poles, but I contend the cost is greaterif one stifles or sanitizes the anecdote.” Gordon has something here, I think.Weaver also told me that academicians are perhaps the newest bullies on thecensorship block and perhaps the most dangerous of all. He stated that, “Thereis a greater danger, it seems to me, when the censors come from the ranks ofthe presumably ‘enlightened’. It is not surprising that a number of college anduniversity communities nurture factions who wish to control free speech; it isunsettling when more sophisticated citizens (faculty) add their clout tomovements desiring to police our utterance in the interests of what minority oranother deems politically incorrect.”Simply as it pertains to literatureitself, PCism influences every aspect of writing and publishing.If PCism wasn’t such an insidiousthreat to free speech, most of it would be laughable. Just this week, reportshave surfaced that the word “illegal” as applied to illegal aliens shouldn’t beused in government reports. That’s just plain moronic. A person who comes acrossour border who isn’t a citizen and doesn’t have permission from the governmentto enter has just broken a law. Therefore, he or she is only one thing.Illegal. And, not an illegal “immigrant.” They’re not immigrating—they’reentering the country illegally. They’re an illegal alien. Nothing but. The sadthing is that there are people who will accept this kind of language seriously.They don’t want to hurt the feelings of people who’ve broken the law? Okay…We’ve got government agenciestargeting individuals and groups for their thoughts and speech. The IRS iscurrently under Congressional investigation for just that. This is somethingevery single American should be incensed at but are they? Nope. As long as theycontinue to get their “free” crap from the government, they’re happy. (Realityalert: It ain’t “free.” It’s paid for with our taxes and our freedoms.)Benjamin Franklin famously wrote that “whoever would overthrow the liberty of anation must begin by subduing the freeness of speech.” These words remain truetoday. What’s truly scary is that the mainstream press is fully complicit inpreventing free speech.What scares me the most is thatuniversities should be the bastion of free thought but the state of the matteris that free debate of ideas is rapidly disappearing from the college campus.As more and more writers come out of university settings and are beinginfluenced by teachers with a decided political bent, the writing they producebecomes more and more insipid. These same writers take over the litmags andeditor positions at publishing houses and impose their political beliefs onthose who submit, publishing only those that can pass the PC test in thecontent of their creative material. As Kurt Vonnegut said, “Literature shouldnot disappear up its own asshole, so to speak.” Well, it’s in great danger ofdoing just that. It’s about halfway up the anus.Alisa Smith, co-editor of TheMarlet, the student newspaper at the University of Victoria in BritishColumbia, says, “Universities are trying to shut down thought, ratherthan newspapers. All the articles that you see are about how PC’s have sort ofgotten a grip on society and how people can’t say what they want anymore. Iguess it’s like a left-wing phenomenon.”Virtually every publisher in thecountry, from the smallest litmag to the largest publishing conglomerate, isterrified of antagonizing any reader whatsoever, unless the person offended isnot part of a highly-organized, highly-vocal political group. It seemseverybody in America has now organized, has a group with a slogan, anewsletter, a home page on the Internet, and a secret handshake. The battle isbeing waged over who gets ultimate control of the presses. And it doesn’tmatter who wins. We all lose. What we lose is freedom of expression. And oncethat happens, we are done as a free society. I go to Gordon Weaver once again,who said it as best as it can be said. “Censorship from without is bad for thelanguage, bad for those who speak or write it; self-imposed censorship, whateverthe motive is worse. If you won’t say what you think, you run the risk oflosing the powers of both speech and thought. I suspect we’ll be safe just aslong as we refuse to accept censorship for anyone.”I’d like to leave you with one of myfavorite quotes. In the preface to the infamous Story of O, Jean Paulhanwrote, “Dangerous books are those that restore us to our natural state ofdanger.”Yes, they do.What else is on the cards for youthis year?  Several things. The launching of mylatest novel, a black comedy crime caper titled THE GENUINE, IMITATION, PLASTICKIDNAPPING from Down & Out Books in October. This one was atrue labor of love. It began life as a short story in The South CarolinaReview, then expanded into a novel as well as a screenplay. The screenplayis still being shopped and placed as a finalist in both the Writer’s Guild andBest of Austin screenplay competitions. I liked the characters so much I’mwriting a sequel and I’ve never done that. In fact, I see several sequels inthe future provided I live long enough to write them.It’s the story of Pete Halliday, adegenerate gambler who was busted out of baseball for… gambling. It picks upten years later in New Orleans where Pete retired to after hanging up his gloveand who has a smarmy sidekick named Tommy LeClerc, a part-Indian, full idiot,who keeps inveigling him into hair-brained schemes. Both are heavily into debtto the Italian Mafia to the point of the duo getting rendered room temperature,and Tommy comes up with the bright idea of kidnapping the head of the CajunMafia (there are a lot of Mafias in the Big Sleazy), but with a twist. Insteadof doing the old-fashioned and boring method of kidnapping, our two heroes planto amputate Charles Deneuve’s hand and hold that unit for ransom. Generalmayhem ensues, including a scene where Pete’s new girlfriend, full-timewaitress and part-time hooker, Cat, helps him escape the Italian Mafia’senforcer, Sam “The Bam” Capelleti who just entered the black bar they’re in, bypretending to have Tourettes and screaming racial epithets for a diversion sohe can slip out the back door while they’re cutting her throat. Or so Peteassumes, but it turns out Cat is slicker than he thought.Tommy’s initial scheme is to kidnapthe manager of a Kenner supermarket and gain cash by holding the guy’s wifehostage while he retrieves the money from the store safe. But… there’s even aprior to this one as they decide they can’t go into this guy’s neighborhoodunless they’re dressed in suits, which neither own. To finance their wardrobe,Tommy lays out a plan where they’ll rob tourists on a streetcar, which goessouth when they discover the passengers are better armed than they are and theyescape in a hail of bullets. They get a loan and buy the suits and show up atthe supermarket guy’s house, only to find out there’s no great love lostbetween the manager and his bride, and that, too, goes quickly south. Itbecomes quickly evident why the Indians lost the war… (This is not a PC Indian,btw—Tommy doesn’t believe in any frickin’ Great Spirits and he’s a polluter parexcellence…)Lots of twists and chases throughthe French Quarters, the Jazz Fest, and other environs and in the end, Pete andTommy get the loot and then Tommy double-crosses Pete. Deneuve’s hand isreturned to its owner, but alas, finds it can’t be reattached as his meathookhas suffered severe freezer burn from when the pair hid it in Tommy’sgirlfriend Wanda’s freezer under the veal cutlets and didn’t realize one needsto burp a Baggie before freezing.In the end, Pete gets revenge onTommy in a particularly ingenious way and he and Cat escape to hide out in theopen in Lost Wages by getting plastic surgery to make them look like famouslookalikes, which Vegas is chockfull of. Only problem is, just before theiroperations by a reputable plastic surgery, Cat spies an ad by a surgeon whooffers a cut-rate on such procedures by not having all the frills such as ahigh-priced office space (he works out of his split-level), nor otherunnecessary items such as a licensed nurse, high-priced anesthetics, etc., andthey end up looking like celebrities, albeit not the ones they envisioned.Instead of Elvis, Pete ends up looking like Liberace with yellower teeth andCat? Well, Cat goes around these days not as the Cher she asked for, but morealong the lines of Bette Midler with black hair and a Jimmy Durante shnozz.She’s not a happy camper…This was just a pure-d fun novel to write.

{"title": "Doing It My Way", "date": "Monday, September 1, 2014", "text": "Hi folks,My buddy, author Marjorie Brody, asked me to write an article for The Thrill Begins, a publication of Thrillerfest and I was delighted to oblige. Here's the article as it appeared:Doing It My Way by Les EdgertonMylatest novel, a black comedy crime caper titled THE GENUINE, IMITATION, PLASTICKIDNAPPING will be released by Down&Out Press in early October. This willbe my 18th published book and is unlike any of my previous work. And, that’s a problem. At least it’s seen as a problem by most agents and editors.Most of those folks greatly prefer their authors establish a “brand” and sinceI’m a dedicated contrarian, I guess I’ve disappointed those folks. It’sdifficult to find more than three books of mine that fit the same category. Do these gatekeepers have a valid point? Absolutely. No doubt about it. When awriter establishes a brand for his or her work, life becomes infinitely easierfor both agents and publishers. For starters—and for the biggest reason—such awriter begins to create a group of followers, and that means dollars. They getthis philosophy from THE MUSIC MAN. Here’s what Harold Hill had to say aboutbranding (slightly paraphrased…):                          With a capital “B” andthat rhymes with “G” and that stands for ‘Gelt.’A vast number of today’s gatekeepers subscribe to Mickey Spillane’s famousphilosophy: “I have no fans. You know what I got? Customers.” Overlooking thegrammatical misstep, this is what drives much of publishing strategy thesedays. Customers. And, books basically are marketed like sanitary napkins. Kotexand Stay Free rule that aisle. My problem is I don’t like that aisle. At least not exclusively. I like to roamall over the store. I enjoy cruising by the produce section, the meat counter,even the refrigerators with the frozen dinners. On a sweltering summer day,there’s nothing better than swinging the door open on the Swanson section andbasking in the frosty air until the second assistant manager makes me close thedoor and come help clean up the spill on Aisle 3. Sometimes, I even like to getoutside and walk the sidewalks or take a ride on the coin pony outside. Agents and publishers don’t like mavericks so much. I know that. I accept that. I have to—it’s reality. Could I change? Yeah, I could, but I don’t wanna. I like being a writer and thefun of that for me is writing about the things that interest me. And, unlikeMr. Spillane, I don’t have many customers. It’s the tradeoff for not becoming abrand name and writing the same book, over and over. What I do have are readers.And, most of my readers are fellow writers. I’m real proud of that. It tells meI’m not seen as a one-trick pony and that’s important to me. I’m kind of likeNabokov—the only two genres I recognize are good writing and bad writing. I was told that the thrust of this article should be to share tips and advicewith my fellow writers on stuff I’ve learned through my own journey inpublishing. The advice I offer is this: At some point, you have to decide foryourself which you want to be. The choices are basically two. One, you canfocus on series or on stand-alone books which fit nicely into a particularniche on the bookshelves.Or, you can roam the entire store. The first choice has a much greater chanceof achieving financial success. The second choice has a good chance of notmaking so much money, but of perhaps having more of that “fun” writing used torepresent when you began. Of course, for a lot of folks, having a lot ofcustomers and making a pile of money represents that ol’ “fun” thing to them.And I’m not denigrating that in the least. It just doesn’t fit my owndefinition.My only desire and goal in writing novels is that each one is better than thelast. I achieved what I consider critical success with my last book, The Rapist.When a guy like Ken Bruen says it’s one of the best things he’s read and “criesout to be a movie,” the temptation is to write another book just like it. But Ican’t do that. If I did that, I would be Mickey Spillane. And, unlike Mr.Spillane, it isn’t customers I’m after. It’s writing a better book than I everhave. And, for me that doesn’t mean to keep on writing the same book. I don’tsee how one can do that by writing a similar book. I don’t feel I can go anydeeper into that particular subject matter than I have. So, I decided to writethe funniest book I was capable of. The book I’m working on now? Well, it’svery different from either The Rapist or The Genuine, Imitation,Plastic Kidnapping. I won’t talk about it here. I’ve found if I talk abouta book I’m working on I kind of lose steam. I’ve already “written” it bytalking about it to others. All I’ll say is that it may not appeal to the folkswho liked Kidnapping. Then again, maybe it will. I don’t know and Idon’t care. Hopefully, without being pretentious, I compare myself to Miles Davis. For youjazz fans who are familiar with both Miles and Dizzy Gillespie, here’s thedifference between them. Miles kept stepping outside his comfort zone andtrying new forms of music. Dizzy took the other route. He found an area thatappealed to lots of people and simply kept on making the same kind of music. Hedid keep getting better. But, he didn’t really step outside his brand. Milesdid. Often with disastrous results. Both were hugely successful, but Miles mayhave become even more so if he’d only kept making the same kind of music. But,he didn’t. I don’t presume to compare myself talent-wise to either, but only intheir approach to their art. And that’s the choice I think most writers have to make for themselves. ShouldI write for sales or should I write what I want to write regardless of sales.If you choose my path, be aware that agents may not swarm to you. You have tobe okay with that. It’s your call. And, either path is just fine. Except, perhaps, to agents. Les Edgerton has a bit of an unconventional background in that he’s anex-con, having spent a bit over two years in prison for burglary, strong-armedand armed robbery, and possession with intent to sell. He’s all cleaned up nowand you can invite him into your home for dinner and won’t have to count thesilverware after he leaves. He’s also earned a B.A. from I.U. and an MFA inWriting from Vermont College. THE GENUINE, IMITATION, PLASTICKIDNAPPING: Pete Halliday is busted out of baseball for gambling and travels toNew Orleans to make his fortune hustling. Five years later, he’s deep in debtto bookies and cohorts with Tommy LeClerc, a Cajun with a tiny bit of Indianblood who considers himself a red man. Tommy inveigles a reluctant Pete intoone scheme after another, the latest a kidnapping caper where they’ll snatchthe Cajun Mafia King and hold his amputated hand for some serious jack. Alongthe way, Pete is double-crossed by Tommy and falls in love with part-timehooker and full-time waitress Cat Duplaisir. With both the Cajun and Italianmobs after them, a chase through Jazz Fest, a Tourettes outbreak in a black barand other zany adventures, all seems lost.“THE GENUINE, IMITATION, PLASTIC KIDNAPPING is a dark crime comedy that willhave you laughing from page one. It crackles with manic energy and mad thrills.If you're looking for a different kind of edgy crime novel, this is the one tograb.” --Bill Crider, author of Compound Murder, Gator Kill and others.“Les Edgerton serves up a gumbo of sexual deviants, small time hustlers, andserious criminals in a caper that reads like a deranged Damon Runyon talerelocated from Broadway to the French Quarter. \"The Genuine, Imitation,Plastic Kidnaping\" is not for the faint of heart, and that's just one ofits selling points.

{"title": "THE GENUINE, IMITATION, PLASTIC KIDNAPPING AVAILABLE FOR PREORDER!", "date": "Thursday, August 28, 2014", "text": "Hi Folks,It is with great pleasure that I am able to announce that you can now preorder the ebook version of THE GENUINE, IMITATION, PLASTIC KIDNAPPING! I'm really, really excited about this! Trade paperback isn't yet available for preorder sales, but should be shortly.This is my favorite all-time book to have written. In fact, I'm writing a sequel to it right now just because I like these characters so much and they have a lot more trouble to get into.Being able to offer prepublication sales on Amazon is a truly big deal for smaller, independent publishers. It presents an opportunity to compete with the \"big boys\" on a much more level playing field. I'm hoping that a lot of folks preorder because what happens on the official day of publication is that all the prepub sales are calculated at that time and what that means is that the book begins with a number of sales--hopefully a significant number!--which means it will open on top or close to the top of the best seller lists. And that, leads to even more significant sales, as it gives the novel a lot more publicity out of the gate.(Official release date is September 30)I feel this is a laugh-out-loud book and the early blurbs it's getting from respected writers are showing they feel the same way also. Here's some of the blurbs we've been graciously given for it:“The most unrepentantlyfunny crime caper you’ll ever find between the pages of a book. Elmore Leonard,eat your heart out!” —Maegan Beaumont, author of Carved in Darkness“Les Edgerton serves up a gumbo of sexualdeviants, small time hustlers, and serious criminals in a caper that reads likea deranged Damon Runyon tale relocated from Broadway to the French Quarter. The Genuine, Imitation, Plastic Kidnapingis not for the faint of heart, and that’s just one of its selling points. Ifyou like crime fiction that cracks wise while offering a peek into the darkerrecesses, this is the book for you.” —Bill Fitzhugh, author of the best-sellingnovel Pest Control and The Exterminators“What makes this wild,wild tale so intriguing is the sense that it must be drawing on first-handknowledge. Edgerton’s sympathetic tough guy narrator gives you anauthentic-feeling glimpse into the unique logic of small time hustlers and bornlosers, with echoes of Ring Lardner and snatches of slam poetry frequentlycatching you by surprise and making it that much more enjoyable.” —MatthewLouis, founding editor of Gutter Books and author of The Wrong Man and CollisionCocktail“Masquerading as anovel, Les Edgerton’s newest gem—TheGenuine, Imitation, Plastic Kidnapping—is really a debauched weekend insteamy New Orleans, loaded with alcohol, drugs, whores, pistols, and a menacingbookie, all available for your personal and private entertainment between thecovers. Narrator Pete Halliday—ex-con, gambler, boozer, ex-baseball pitcher andunwise wiseass—takes us places most don’t really want to go, only to have thetime of our lives when we get there. Listen to him: ‘Coming into New Orleans,you could smell it. First day out of jail after thirty days, you could reallysmell it. Hot and sexy, a couple hundred thousand red hot little mamas,stepping out of steamy baths and showers, their skin sticky from the heat,getting ready for Saturday night...’ Every pitch Pete throws is a hair-raisingthrill, a belly laugh or a clue to the wicked and violent puzzle that hangsover his New Orleans adventure. You know someone has to die.” —Jack Getze,Fiction Editor, Spinetingler Magazine“The Genuine, Imitation,Plastic Kidnapping is a dark crime comedy that will have you laughing frompage one. It crackles with manic energy and mad thrills. If you’re looking fora different kind of edgy crime novel, this is the one to grab.” —Bill Crider,author of the Sheriff Dan Rhodes Mysteries“There are two certainties when reading anythingwritten by Les Edgerton. First you’ll get gritty, hard hitting noir straightout the top drawer that’ll leave you punch drunk on the floor. Second is it’llbe like nothing you’ve ever picked up before. The Genuine, Imitation, Plastic Kidnapping is no exception. Expectthe unexpected. Read it, love it.” —Keith Nixon, author of The Fix“There’s nothing fake about The Genuine, Imitation, Plastic Kidnapping.Les Edgerton’s latest book is the real deal, and has everything to keep youturning the pages. It’s a caper, full of fun and high-jinx, but it’s alsobitter-sweet, engendering a full range of emotions. You’ll smile, you’ll wince,you’ll laugh out loud, and sometimes you’ll even cringe, but you’ll come away fromthe read feeling thoroughly satisfied and entertained. A terrific read.” —Matt Hilton, author of thebest-selling Joe Hunterthrillers“When it comes towriting crime stories, Les Edgerton can do pretty much it all, and TheGenuine, Imitation, Plastic Kidnapping finds him in a mood to have fun.This book is like a raucous party for crime fiction lovers, complete withgoons, guns, and schemes-within-schemes. Best of all, the comic voice of itsne’er-do-well narrator is a pleasure from start to finish.” —Jake Hinkson,author of Hell On Church Street and The Posthumous Man“You’re in for sometwisted laughs as one of crime fiction’s most authentic voices takes on darkhumor. In The Genuine, Imitation, Plastic Kidnapping, Les Edgerton findsevery line that oughtn’t be crossed and drags his characters back and forth’til it’s blurred. You may want to reach in and give his criminal hero a shake,except you’re bound to be aching to see what kind of trouble he can createnext. Humor is human, the blacker the better, and Edgerton serves it up nastyand raw!” —Rob Brunet, author of Stinking Rich“TheGenuine, Imitation, Plastic Kidnapping is like the fever-dream of a two-bit conman who fancies himself acriminal genius. Add in some seedy and saucy New Orleans locales and you’ve gota gumbo of freaky sex, covert mob men and botched amputations. This the mosthavoc ever wrought in one man’s quest for a measly ol’ po’ boy shop, and acreole crime caper you won’t want to miss.” —Nik Korpon, author of Fait Ave and Stay God, Sweet Angel“ImagineLes Edgerton’s writing. Dark, despairing noir. Habitual criminals. Rapists.This is nothing like that. : Edgerton takes a break from The Bitch and TheRapist to exercise his inner Westlake. A ‘no holds barred’ and ‘What else cango wrong’ caper with even more laughs than plot twists. The Genuine,Imitation, Plastic Kidnapping has a plot John Dortmunder would have troublenegotiating, and Edgerton milks it for all it’s worth. Not for the faint ofheart, the crime that really sets the story off involved kidnapping agangster—no, I can’t do it. I don’t want to spoil even that much. Suffice tosay kidnapping, sexual fetishes, forced amputation, Tourette’s syndrome,certain death, and one-way tickets to Skagway, AK are all played for laughs,and he pulls it off. Big fun. My daughter described the movie Ted as “Reallyfunny and wildly inappropriate.” It’s like that. —Dana King, author GrindJoint and A Small Sacrifice“TheGenuine, Imitation, Plastic Kidnapping is a steamy caper novel that reads like an arm wrestling matchbetween Ring Lardner and Quentin Tarantino, while James Lee Burke takes bets onthe outcome. I only stopped laughing to flinch occasionally. A terrific novel,for the strong of heart—and funny bone.”—WarrenMoore III, author Broken Glass Waltzes“Ahard-driving, relentless story with grab-you-by-the-throat characters.”—GrantBlackwood, New York Times bestselling author“There isnothing quite like reading a Les Edgerton novel. His voice crackles with alifelike intensity. The Genuine, Imitation,Plastic Kidnapping is the most incredible, entertaining and detailedbar story you've ever heard. Reading it, you can't shake that feeling thatyou've living a special, unique moment where anything is possible, like thatnight at the bar.”—Benoît Lelièvre, www.deadendfollies.com I am totally stoked by the early opinions of writers I hugely respect.Anyway, infomercial over... please click on the cover photo if you want to place a preorder. And, if you want to wait for the trade paperbook version, just keep checking with Amazon until it appears which it should, shortly.

{"title": "OPENINGS IN OUR NEXT ONLINE CLASS", "date": "Friday, August 22, 2014", "text": "Hifolks,Asmost of you know, I run an online novel writing class that runs for ten weeksat a time and is in operation year-round. We’re coming up to the end of thecurrent session in a couple of weeks, and then will take a couple of weeks offand then begin the next session. Usually, we don’t have openings for new classmembers, but it looks as if we’re going to have a couple of openings this time,so I just want to let folks know in case anyone’s interested. If you are,please send me an email at butchedgerton@comcast.netand let me know. Below, I’ll give an outline of how it works. When new openingsoccur, first chance to join is given to the auditors and after that it’s afirst-come, first-served basis. To be able to devote the proper time to eachstudent, the class will be limited to ten people. An unlimited number ofauditors are taken.AuditorsThoseinterested in auditing the class—which would allow the auditing person toreceive and view everything the rest of the class does, but not be able toparticipate actively, solely as an observer. The fee is substantially less forauditors than participating students. Basically, auditors will sit in on theclass as an observer. There can be an unlimited number of auditors. Some writers are uncomfortable with very many observing their work and our exchangesas, to be honest, many of our comments are brutally frank. Students know andwelcome this, but to someone not directly participating can see it another way.There won’t be any interaction at all with auditors—they’ll be there simply touse the knowledge they might pick up for their own writing or even their ownteaching.Pertinent infofor active class members:Thisclass will be conducted in a workshop format. What that means is each weekparticipants will send a designated number of pages to both me and the othermembers of the class. When I receive each person’s work, I’ll providecomments/criticism/suggestions to improve for each student on their work andthen send it back to them and the others in class. Each person in class doesthe same for each other—reading and providing comments on each other’s work andsending that back to the class and me. It’s exactly like being in an“on-ground” workshop. I’ve found over a lifetime of teaching classes—beginningwith the UCLA Writer’s Program—that this is the single best method of learning.There is a synergy at work with this model. Many writing classes consist of thestudent sending work in and the instructor commenting. That’s okay, in alimited way, but when you have ten others plus the instructor or workshopleader commenting, the value of the class increases almost exponentially.Ibelieve in road maps when embarking on the lengthy journey a novel entails;therefore, I ask each student to submit a 15-20 word outline of their proposed novel. I don’t have the space hereto explain how that works, but I send a handout on how to create such anoutline before the class begins, and it serves to keep the writer focused ontheir novel throughout its creation and also helps the workshop leader and hisclassmates see instantly if the writer is focused or meandering. I’m a firmbeliever in beginning a novel in the proper place and once that is achieved,the remainder of the novel becomes infinitely easier to create. We’ll spend themost time on a writer’s novel beginning than any other part of their novel.Thisclass will be composed of students who’ve previously taken classes with mealong with newcomers. To be able to serve each level of student fairly,students who are well along into their novel and have taken previous classes,will be able to submit up to eight pages per week. New students who haven’ttaken my class, will be allowed to submit up to five pages per week until they’veachieved a publishable opening, and, once they’ve achieved a proper beginning,will then be able to send eight pages each week thereafter. Please know thatthis may sound like favoritism, but it’s not at all. The beginning of a novelis the single most crucial part of writing a novel, imo, and I spend more timeon that than anything else. I’ve learned over many years, that a great manywriters have a poor understanding of a novel’s structure and it’s crucial thata sound knowledge of novel structure (particularly beginnings) be achievedbefore devoting much time to the rest of the novel. I’ll spend much more time onthe newer student’s five pages than I will on the more experienced writer’s.Please feel free to query those in class who’ve been with me before as to theiropinion and I feel certain they’ll agree with me. I’ll be happy to furnishnames and email addresses for those writers should you wish to ask theiropinion.Periodically,I also send handouts to the class on some element of writing, as well as otherpertinent info that’s useful.Beforewarned that this workshop isn’t for the faint of heart! Some have termed it“Les Edgerton’s Bootcamp for Writers.” In “real life” I’m not a mean person, butwith writing I’m not going to hold hands nor hand out false praise. That’s what most localwriting groups are for and they do it well. I expect each person to participatefully and comment on each other’s work just as they would want others to do thesame for theirs. I don’t tolerate very well, those who keep making the samemistakes week after week. For example, the proper and professional format isexplained at the beginning and each class there are always one or two newcomerswho keep making the same, easily-fixed mistake. Here’s a common example: One ofthe format rules is that there is only one space between sentences incomputer-generated material. Many older writers, in the typewriter days ofyore, were taught to use two spaces. The kernaling in computers is different thantypewriters and using two spaces is a sure sign of an amateur who hasn’t keptup with current usages and just another red flag a writer ought to avoid. Iunderstand it’s a hard habit to overcome—I had to do the same myself—but thereis an easy way to relearn this which we give, and even if it takes awhile torelearn this, a writer can at least do a final edit before sending work in andcorrect this. To not do so, indicates to me a writer who doesn’t respect eitherthemselves or their fellow writers or the teacher. Frankly, I don’t want towaste time with this type of writer. I’m not speaking of the writer who makesoccasional mistakes, but of the one who continually keeps making the samemistake after it’s been pointed out.Writingwell isn’t easy. It’s hard. If someone has told you that writing is easy,they’ve lied to you. Typing is easy; writing is hard. Our aim in our class isto help writers create publishable work. By reputable publishers, not vanitypresses.IfI haven’t scared you off, here are the particulars:1.Fee is $400, payable in advance and nonrefundable. Auditor’s fee is $50 and isalso nonrefundable.2.Each week, you’ll send to the entire group and me, your pages. You’ll alsoreceive work from your classmates to read and provide comments on. The commentsaren’t intended to be scholarly or exhibit some high degree of technicalknowledge. We just want to know what worked for you in the person's writing and whatdidn’t and why.3.To help make the class run smoothly, there will be deadlines each week. Forinstance, if the class begins on a Monday each week, you’ll send in your workby the following Wednesday. Then, starting on Thursday, you’ll send in yourcomments on each other’s work. I’ll send my comments to each of you by Saturdaynight. Then, the next week begins on the following Monday.4.Often, the class and I kind of hit a wall. It’s pretty intense. To account forthat event, we may take a week hiatus and return the following week. In fact,you can pretty well count on that.5.We don’t expect a student to be a professional writer at all. It’s a class, notan advanced degree program. Our aim is to help each writer become better attheir craft as a result of the class, and to learn how to professionally submitmaterial, and to hopefully end up creating work that is publishable legitimately.6.While I would never say I would recommend students to agents or publishers,very often I do. The people who finish the class almost always have progressedto the point where their work is, indeed, publishable, and when that happensI’m eager to introduce them and recommend their work to gatekeepers.7.Required reading will be my book, HOOKED, and Jack Bickham’s book, SCENES &STRUCTURE. Recommended reading will be Janet Burroway’s WRITING FICTION.Ifanyone is interested and has more questions, please feel free to email me at butchedgerton@comcast.net.Thankyou,LesP.S.Some additional info…We’ll have a couple of new studentsthis time—most writers keep re-upping each time but occasionally one or twowill drop out for various reasons: demands of a new job not allowing them tocommit the considerable time that is required to participate, needing time offto address the notes their new agent just gave them for the novel he signed,and so on. Most just keep on, even after they’ve gotten an agent and/or sold theirnovel, and begin writing a new one. Almost all who stick out the entire sessioncome back. The ones who quit usually quit fairly soon into the class. It’s notfor everyone. Nobody holds anybody’s hand and every single one of us is focusedon but one thing—helping each other write a novel that’s publishable. It’s atough game and not for everyone.I try to warn people who arethinking of joining us, how tough the class is, but I know from past experiencethat even so forewarned, at least some are going to be in for a shock when theysee that we really don’t hold hands, pat people on the back for minimumefforts, or overlook writing that doesn’t work. I’m not cruel (at least I don’tthink so) nor are any of the oldtimers in class, but most new folks haven’tbeen exposed to a class like ours. The truth is, most writers who haven’t had aclass like ours has been praised in other classes or most likely, has been inclasses that use the “sandwich” method of teaching. You know—that deal wherethe teach applies a bit of praise, then a bit of criticism, and then a bit ofpraise. Well, that ain’t our shtick. Not even close. The comments we allprovide on everyone’s work fit one definition only. They’re honest.This isn’t to be mean or to act likewe’re the only folks around who know what good writing is. Except… we do. I’mnot aware of any other class out there with the kind of track record oursenjoys. Virtually every writer who stays the course with us ends up with a topagent and/or a book deal. That doesn’t happen in a single ten-week session.About the earliest anyone has earned an agent or book deal in our class hasbeen about a year. And, that’s reasonable.The thing is, our writers don’texpect things to be easy.Here are a few comments by students:Hi ________. Since Les opened thefloor for comments from the \"class veterans\" I'm chipping in with mytwo cents. I have a file cabinet filled with stuff I sent Les and then neededasbestos gloves to take the paper off the printer. When I started this journey,I'd never taken an English class past high school. (I was pre-med in college) Ifigured I love to read, so how hard can it be? Okay, quit laughing at me.Clearly, when I wrote my first version of my first novel, I had no idea aboutstory structure, POV, any of that. I figured I'm pretty articulate andtherefore I can write?Les quickly set me straight. All ofthis is to point out that we've all been on the receiving end of Les' brutalhonesty. I will find some of the comments he made on my work and post them butphrases like \"throwing up in my mouth now\" and \"bury this sodeep in the yard no one ever finds it\" are seared into my brain and Idon't have to look to find those!!! The point is, I took other classes before Imet Les and the teachers were kind and gentle and never told me I sucked. If itweren't for Les, I'd still be churning out awful drivel that makes people wantto throw up instead of trying not to throw up while I wait to see if my agentis able to sell my book. I would never have gotten an agent without Les. Sohang in there. Listen to everything he says and if it doesn't make sense, askaway....and... The novel that I am currently tryingto sell has been a work in progress since 2009. The first time Les saw it hesent it back and told me to re-write the WHOLE thing!!! My character was a wimp.She sat back and let things happen to her. I argued a little, rewrote a littleand then moved on to another book. After a year, I went back and reread it andsaw the truth. It was awful. So I took a deep breath and started over. Pageone. First sentence. Re-wrote the entire thing. It took a full year and then Irevised it again. It's definitely a process. But once you get the Incitingincident and the outline steps down pat, it's a whole lot easier. Trust me!!!And you'll never graduate completely. A few months ago, Les and I wenthead-to-head on one single passage. I was trying to be lazy and take the easyway out. He called me on it and I resubmitted three or four weeks in a row,revisions on the same passage. I was sure my classmates were so sick of it theywere going to stick needles in their eyes rather than read it again! But in theend, the passage rocked!! So hang in there!!!!

Robin Williams was without peer.I never had the good fortune to meet himpersonally, but I felt I almost knew him because of the dozens of stories myfriend Lisa Lieberman Doctor told me about him. Lisa was the person he chose tohead up his production company, Blue Wolf Productions, and she acquired dozens ofscripts for him, including MRS. DOUBTFIRE. In fact, one of the first storiesshe told me about him was how they acquired that product.Lisa Lieberman DoctorLisa said that she turned down thescript. It just wasn’t that well-written, in her opinion. However, Robin choseto override her rejection of it—which he could because he was… well, the boss…It wasn’t the script he liked, Lisa said, but the concept. She told me thatscarcely any of the original script made it to the screen. She said Robinimprovised virtually all of it.She told me a funny story that happenedon the first day of principle photography on the set of MRS. DOUBTFIRE. Whenthe cameras begin rolling, large sums of money are being expended, and it’sextremely important nothing slow up the shooting.Well, Lisa said, everyone on the set wasworried when Robin didn’t appear immediately. True, it took several hours toget him into costume and one of the main problems was that Robin was anextremely hirsute man. She said he had hair everywhere and for the scenes heappeared as Mrs. Doubtfire, it took several hours to remove the hair from hisshoulders, back, arms, legs… everywhere. His beard was particularly tough and extremelydifficult to render smooth.Anyway, the tension was rising as hefailed to appear on the set, everyone getting more and more nervous, and then,all of a sudden, he was in Lisa’s office, in full costume, and with a strickenlook on his face. “Lisa,” he said, “I’m supposed to go on camera right now butI’ve got a big problem.” “What?” she said, imagining all kinds of horriblescenarios. “Well,” Robin said. “I don’t know what to do. I’ve got to go on… andI’ve got a woody.”Now, Lisa is a tiny Jewish woman and Icould just imagine her looking up at this large man, dressed in a dress, andlifting her hands helplessly, and saying, “Uh…what exactly do you want me todo, Robin?” And then he laughed and all the tension went out of the room, andthe first day of principle photography went well.Over the years of our friendship, Lisahas told me literally dozens and dozens of stories about Robin. Nearly everyone of them made me laugh. Some made me sad. All were stories that couldn’t betold about any other person. Robin Williams was truly a genius, truly a Renaissanceman. A true original and a national treasure.He’ll be sorely missed.Blue skies,Les"},
{"title": "COVER REVEAL AND ON OUTLINING", "date": "Thursday, August 7, 2014", "text": "Late update: I just received an email from Joseph D'Agnese where he said:Mr Edgerton:I tried to leave a comment on your recent post on outlining but the system devoured it whole. The outlining method you describe was first described by journalist Jon Franklin in his book Writing for Story. Great book, but it is mostly focused on writing in-depth journalism pieces. My wife and I love that book and refer to it often. But I have always struggled with how to apply his method to longer works of fiction. I think my hangup has always been about to describe an entire book in only five sentences. But I think you have nailed it. Thank you!JoeI thanked him for not only letting me know who to give credit for the outlining method, but for going the extra mile in reaching me--much appreciated! So now you know where I got it--from the legendary Jon Franklin!Also, Joe isn't the first person who's contacted me and told me he couldn't post a comment here. I don't know what to do about that--does anyone have any solutions or suggestions? Keep in mind I barely know what a keyboard is and very little about how the Intergnat works--especially blogs! I hate it that people try to comment and are unable to--my apologies!Hi folks,Today, fellow writer Ransom Noble posted an article on outlining in her blog and she graciously mentioned my method. Since I last posted it in 2010, I thought perhaps it might be time for a rerun. Also, I have some exciting news--I have a cover for my newest novel, THE GENUINE, IMITATION, PLASTIC KIDNAPPING coming out in October from Down&Out Books. You'll see it at the end of this article. Hope you like it and hope you'll buy the book when it comes out!  OUTLININGA STORYAnyoneon this blog whom I’ve taught will recognize the following. It’s always thefirst lesson I give in both online and “on-ground” creative writing classes. Idecided to post this because recently, on another forum, I’ve been seeing a lotof conversations based on outlining. What I’ve observed from their remarks isthat the great majority have only experienced one kind of outline—that oldcomposition thing with the Roman numerals that go on for pages… What I’m goingto show here is a very different kind of outline. One that makes sense. Isinfinitely simpler and actually works.Let’scover some history first…Like a lot of writers, I wasted alot of time in my writing career simply because I ignored what is probably thebiggest \"secret\" in creating short stories and novels. I didn'toutline.Outlines were a particular typeof hell English teachers visited upon you - those horrid things with Romannumerals and topics and subtopics and all that junk. Yuch! Outlining took allthe fun out of reading a book.I also read interviews withwriters who said they never outlined. It would destroy their\"creativity\" many claimed. The way to write a story was to create acharacter, start them out in trouble and kind of follow them around as they hadneat adventures. What it took years to realize was that my characters had greatadventures and it was kind of fun following them around...until somewherebetween pages eight and twenty when they would peter out. I had a drawerful ofsome of the best starts of stories you ever saw. Problem was, they never wentanywhere. And most of them never came close to an ending. Oh, a few did, thereally short ones. There were even one or two that came to a respectablelength...after rewriting them twenty times.What I didn't realize for thelongest time was that writing involves the processing and integration of largeblocks of trivial bits of information. As the length of my stories grew, so didthe complexity. All of a sudden, I was on page thirteen and I suddenlyremembered I couldn't have my character chase the bad guy...because on page twoI'd given him bronchial asthma. I had to go back and \"cure\" him. WhatI didn't realize was something pretty obvious. A story, like the life itrepresents, is basically complex. Stories aren't built like a line of dominoes,it more resembles a web, and when you tug a bit harder on one of its manystrands, the whole business vibrates. And changes shape. Not only did I have toremember the many details and their connections, I had to keep them in alogical order. Virtually impossible.I even managed to write severalbooks in this manner. Looking back on those days I cringe. What an awful lot ofenergy I needlessly wasted!Here was my typical process. Ibet at least some of you have gone through the same procedure. I'd get a greatidea, so great that I'd have to drop the baby if I was holding him, and fly tomy typewriter. (Remember - this was in the days of yore when they had thoseancient artifacts...) As fast as my fingers could fly, I'd write. A hundredwords would accumulate. Then, two hundred. Then...well, then I began to runinto problems.Something I did in the firsthundred words didn't quite fit with the three hundredth, but I wasn't quitesure what it was. Something was just \"off\". It would bother andconfuse me, but I didn't want to deal with it. So, I'd push on, fix it later,whatever it was. Just get the stuff out, in the white heat of creativity.That's what rewriting was for, right? To fix stuff that didn't fit.Only now the writing reallyslowed. The next fifty words were the hardest. I was running out of steam. Theidea I'd begun with seemed stale, trite. If I could even remember the originalidea. Crap! I'd say, finally, slamming shut the typewriter case. Maybe tomorrowthe Muse would redescend...Hardly ever happened. On themorrow, a new idea would strike, with the same kind of heat as the first oneand I'd be off and running with that one.With the same results.In no time at all, I had boxes ofunfinished stories. Sound familiar?Well, I learned a trick. I won'tgo through the whole sorry history of how I wasted time and learned, little bylittle, to work smarter. What happened, after many centuries (well, it seemslike that now) was that I began kind of jotting down a half page of notes. Ieven began figuring out my endings before I began.Now I began to finish stories.Not a lot, but a lot more than I had previously. After a couple of years ofthis, I began to expand my notes. Never once did I think of what I was doing as\"outlining.\" There weren't any Roman numeral. How could that be anoutline?And then...one day I got one ofthose Joycean epiphanies. What I was doing was an outline! But, these weren'toutlines like Missus Grundy had us doing back in P.S. 121. These were justnotes. Notes kind of organized. And I discovered something else. Those oldwriters were liars. Hemingway, Steinbeck and Shakespeare - they all claimedthey didn't outline, but they had to. Their stuff all held the kind of integritythat only comes in thinking through a project first before you pick up the saw.They just said they didn't outline. All of a sudden, I knew better.Those guys probably didn't think they outlined either. I doubt if any of themhad Roman numerals on their notes either. I'd bet money they had notes, though,and copious notes...and copious notes organized into some kind of system.Before they ever picked up the ol' writing quill and wrote \"ChapterOne\". Probably what a lot of them did was write a first draft...and thenused that for their \"outline\". Without calling it that, of course, oreven thinking of it in that way. Hemingway didn’t outline—he had 80,000 wordoutlines (also called a “first draft). Same thing, just a bit cumbersome andtime-consuming to create. I bet that's what they did though. They weren't anydifferent than I was. Or you. If any writer begins their story without knowingprecisely where they're going, any mistakes they make at first, any tinyomissions, take on added significance as he or she proceeds. As length growslinearly, complexity expands exponentially. Fact of life. The writinglife anyway.If one is muleheaded enough, astory can be bulled through without outlining. Even fairly long stories. It'skind of a masochistic exercise though. It may take twenty, even thirty rewritesto get a decent story that way.Don't ask me how I know this.I'll begin crying. I'll have to. My wife knows I recall experiences like thisand keeps all the sharp instruments locked up.Novels are the worst experiencein the world without an outline. After you spend several years learning tojuggle thousands of details in your head - you can get pretty good at it - youcan write longer and longer material. Except, that no matter how good you getat retaining all this stuff in your head, you'll probably end up stuck on aboutpage ninety. That seems to be the magic length for novels. Not quite longenough by about three hundred pages. Short stories seem to peter out aroundbetween pages six to eight.If you've got an outline you justdon't have these problems. Stuck? Glance up at your outline and instantlyyou'll be reminded where you are in the story and your perspective will return.The dizzy feeling will recede.Okay. Sales pitch for outlinesover. I learned my technique from taking screenplay writing classes. Those guysalways outline. That's how they can write scripts so quickly. I took aclass in this program with Martin Goldstein and I wrote a 108-page script intwo days. And Mr. Goldstein says it's a great script - has attached himself toit as the producer and not only that - this \"two-day\" script was justnamed a semifinalist in the Academy Foundation's Nicholl’s Fellowships inScreenwriting awards. Not bad for two days work! I wrote the first 64 pages inabout eight hours and the remaining 44 pages in about ten hours. Piece of cake.Of course, I spent about a week and a half on the outline. I do write quickly,so don't use my times as a model. Without an outline, I'd still be writing...Let's get to these puppies.Here's how you create an outline for your story. Ready?1. You make notes to yourself asyou imagine the story played out.2. You arrange those notes.3. As the writing proceeds, yourefer to them.That's it. Or so I thought at thetime. It was a lot easier than what I used to do, but there was still somethingI was to learn.I got lucky. I happened on a bookthat really opened my eyes as far as outlines. I honestly can’t remember thebook—I’ve got thousands and thousands and thousands of books, literally—and Iwish I could so I could give the author his proper credit (I do remember it wasa man), but he gave me the best outlining tool I’ve ever come across. It’snothing at all like those ten-pound puppies with the Roman numerals as you’llsee.The outline I propose you trythat I took from this guy’s book on writing consists of five simple statementsthat describe the major actions through which the story will be told. Onestatement for each major focus. And each statement will be short, consistingonly of two to three words. A human noun, a strong, concrete actionverb, and (most of the time) a direct object. (We won't count articles such as\"a\", \"an\", and \"the\" as words.) The simpler anoutline is the more it focuses on the important relationships in your story.Words actually count for more in an outline than in the story. An outline likeI'm proposing should have no more than fifteen to twenty words in it. Twentywords max for a 400-page novel. In a story, the almost-right word can sometimessuffice, but in an outline, it has to be the perfect word. Another differencebetween this version of an outline and the ones Missus Grundy had you do isthat the statements in her outlines represented topic sentences and as suchspecify what comes at the beginning of the section they represent.That's because in logical writing, the writer states her premise firstand then develops it.In dramatic stories, however, thedramatic action that makes your point comes at the end of each section -where climaxes belong. What this means is that your outline statementsrepresent endings, not beginnings. This is an important point to keep in mind.This is ultra-important to grasp. I’ll say it again: Your outline statements represent endings,not beginnings. I think this is why we hate those old Comp I kinds ofoutlines. It doesn’t allow any room for creativity at all. This does.In almost all novels, there arethree major movements involved as the protagonist struggles to resolve his orher problem. There are dozens—maybe even hundreds—of smaller movements, but byand large, there are almost always three major movements or crucial points.That’s what this kind of outline will show. First, the inciting incident thatkicks off the story. Then, the resultof each of the three major movements. Finally, the resolution. Five statements.That’s it. The whole of your novel is contained therein. With enormous freedomwithin it for those who are afraid their creativity will be stifled…This is so important to graspingthis that I’m going to belabor it a bit. Each statement represents the result of the major action taken toresolve the problem. Not the  beginning and development of the action.Major difference and for those that don’t get this, it’s always because theyhaven’t shifted their thinking and definition of outlines from those old compdefinitions and models. Again, it represents the outcome of the major action. How you as the author get to thatoutcome is totally up to you. It gives you complete creative freedom. Look atit as the same thing as driving from New York to Los Angeles. You know that’syour goal. Get to L.A. There are a thousand ways to do that. You might drivedown and go through Arizona. You might go north and go through part of Canada.You might zig-zag northwest and southwest the whole way. You might go directlywest in a straight line. What’s important is that you end up in L.A., right?That’s what this kind of outline does. It gives you your outcome (arriving inL.A.), but it allows you complete freedom in how you get there. I know I keeprepeating this, but I also know from experience how ingrained those godawfulcomp I outlines are in our brains, that it’s important that you grasp thedifference.I'm going to use my own story IShoulda Seen a Credit Arranger in my collection titled \"Monday'sMeal\" to illustrate a typical outline. The first statement will be:Complicationor inciting incident:Debt endangers Pete (This is the complication thatprovides the occasion for the story. Every story must have an inciting incidentto kick-start it. Something must happen that changes the protagonist's worldand by doing so, creates a problem/goal. This is where stories must begin - notwith setting or backstory. Act I, as it were.)Development: (This is the second part of theoutline. The development steps that lead to the resolution. Act II, as it were,following Aristotle's Poetics)1.Tommy cons Pete into a kidnapping2. Pete and Tommy botchkidnapping3. Pete escapesResolution: (This is the third and finalstep. Act III.)Pete pays for mistakeHere’sthe outline without the extraneous material:Debt endangers Pete.Tommy cons Pete into a kidnappingPete and Tommy botch thekidnappingPete pays for mistake.I usedthis for the 18-page  short story thatappeared first in The South CarolinaReview and then I wrote a 92,000 word novel… using the same exact outline.Worked perfectly for both of them. Oh, yeah. I also wrote a screenplay for thisthat was a finalist in both the Writer’s Guild and Best of Austin screenplaycompetitons… and guess what? You guessed it. I used the same exact outline andit worked perfectly. There are major differences in all three versions, but thecentral story remained the same and was a practical instrument in all three forms.It works!This came to seventeen words, twoover the optimim. If you're under twenty, you're fine. Once I have thisoutline, the rest is just filling in the blanks. But, everything in the storymust contribute to the outline. I can't, for instance, start talking aboutPete's childhood in New Orleans, for example. Not unless it contributes to thesituation he's in.Now. Look at the elements.There's each of the three things I said should be in the outline. A human noun,a strong, concrete action verb, and a direct object. I didn't, for instance,say \"Pete is in debt\" for my complication. Why? Because is isa static verb. Always think in straightforward active terms.You might also notice I didn'thave a happy-sappy \"Hollywood\" ending. Those don't work inliterature. They work (I guess) in direct-to-video movies (and more than a fewthat we see at the theater) and in supermarket novels, but not in qualityfiction, and that's what we're interested in here, I assume.Doesn't look much like MissusGrundy's Roman numeral outline, does it? But, if you read the story and thencompare it to the outline, you'll see it's all there. And it allows for you toroam and be creative within the story. You just have to remain within thestrictures of the outline. But, there's a heck of a lot of freedom there!Let’s look at just one of thosestatements, the first one. Tommy consPete into a kidnapping. In the short story, titled I Shoulda Seen a Credit Arranger, this action took about fourpages. Tommy comes into a bar where Pete’s hustling pool, draws him away fromthe huckleberry he’s hustling to another bar, where he lays out the scam, tokidnap the head of the Cajun Mafia and amputate his hand and hold that forransom. That was how I got to the outcome of the outlined point.Then, in the novel, it took about80 pages to get to the same point. I had more room with the novel. In thenovel, Pete still has the same problem—in heavy debt to the Mafia forgambling—and Tommy cons him into the same kidnapping as before. But, this time,to get to that place, there’s some other developments. First, Tommy talks Peteinto kidnapping a supermarket manager and holding his wife in their home withPete guarding her while Tommy and the manager go to his store and clean out hissafe. But, before that, the pair realize they don’t have suits and part of thesupermarket caper is that they have to go into their nice neighborhood andwithout suits they’ll stick out. So, because they’re tapped out and neitherhave a suit, they decide to pick up operating capital (to buy suits with) byrobbing a streetcar. Which goes horribly wrong. Now, because of a surveillancecamera on the streetcar, their pictures are everywhere on TV and the stakes arereally ratcheted up. Besides escaping the Mob, they now have to worry about thelaw. Finally, they do kidnap the head of the Cajun Mafia and remove his hand.See what I mean about the freedom this kind of outline allows? Enormousfreedom. They still get to the kidnapping, but this time, instead of driving straightthrough, they go way down south to Arizona before they wend back up northwestto L.A. Same outline, same outcome, different way to get there.In the screenplay, they don’t getto the kidnapping until about page 45. And, some other things happen there thatdidn’t in the short story or novel. But…they still end up in L.A. Can you see how this kind of outline gives you aroadmap as well as complete freedom? It really, really does. It’s why when Isee as I did in the recent postings of another forum about people spouting offabout how they hate outlines, I know they’ve never been exposed to this kind.They’re always thinking about 10-page (or longer!) monstrosities with all thoseRoman numerals, describing the beginningsand travel route to their scene or plot point goals. I agree. Those arehorrible, horrible, mind-numbing and creativity-stifling monsters. This isn’tat all. What this kind of outline does isforce you to think through the story before you write it. You spot problemsbefore you waste two hundred or two thousand (or more) words on them. Suddenly,writing becomes a breeze. It really does.In the story above, thedefinition of a story is adhered to. A story consists of a character in trouble- has a need, wants something, etc. A story always begins with theinciting incident - whatever happens to drastically change the protagonist'sworld and create a problem for him or her (it has to be the biggest problem inhis/her life at that point and one the reader will deem worthy enough to followhim in solving it, reaching his/her goal). Pete's in trouble - he owes a lot ofmoney to a nasty bookie. He has to do something about it. He does get trickedby Tommy into an ill-fated kidnapping, but once he's in it, he begins to takehis own action. You can have coincidence in a story, but it should never be acoincidence that helps the main character. It can appear at first to doso, but it never really can. It must always hinder the character. Andstories are drama, which means you must create scenes, not wander around insidethe head of the character, and scenes are by definition, action. Theremust be dramatic action. Also, a protagonist may be reactive at first, but veryquickly he or she must become proactive, acting on his or her own behalf tosolve the problem, gain the goal, etc. Reactive characters (characters to whomthings \"happen\" in which they spend their time on stage reacting tothose things) are boring and don't belong in good fiction. And lastly, becauseof an action the protagonist takes, there must come a reversal and achange in the character. What Joyce called an \"epiphany\". Charactersin fiction, must, as a result of the actions of the story, become profoundlychanged from the person they were at the beginning of the story. Also, the charactercan't just think through the problem, although obviously, that can be a part ofhis epiphany, but it has to be occasioned by an action that he can then processinternally. The epiphany also cannot be attained through a conversation withanother character. There has to be an actual action which changes him and turnsthe story. Once that happens, the story is over. Get out. Start a new story.But first create an outline for it. You'll thank yourself.A logical question is: What if Isee a “better” story or way for the character to get from Point A to Point B?Maybe even an entirely different story? No problem. Just change your outlineand you still have a roadmap that’s easy to follow and one that give youcomplete freedom.The nice thing about this kind ofoutline is that you save paper. You can write the whole thing on a napkin oreven a matchbook cover…Once you've created an outline ofthis sort, it's almost impossible to stray in the wrong direction. If you findyourself doing that, just glance at the outline and get back on the right road.Blue skies,LesAnd now--here's my new cover! Ain't it cool?!"},

{"title": "Guest Post on Addiction by Mark Matthews", "date": "Sunday, June 29, 2014", "text": "Hi folks,A writer pal of mine, Mark Matthews, has recently written a post on his blog about addiction and how writers can write about characters who are jonsing realistically, and since there are at least a couple of writers who use such characters in their fiction who gather here (as well as a few people who've been addicted themselves...), I thought it might be beneficial to look at what he has to say.Here's Mark:IAM 22 YEARS SOBER TODAY, SO I WROTE A POST CALLED \"GETTING YOUR CHARACTERHIGH: WRITING ABOUT ADDICTION\" Around 9:37 am today I am  22 years clean and sober. Yep. 22 years. Whatthe hell is that? Crazy huh. (I’ve blogged on this subject a lot over the years,such as hereand here.) I like to think the hell I put myself through helped me gain theperseverance to run marathons and write books, despite all the forces in theuniverse trying to stop me.Substance abuse and addiction play amajor role in many of my books. On theLips of Children features a crystal meth addict living in adrug-smuggling tunnel who snorts bath salts. STRAYis loosely based on my experience working as a therapist in a treatment center.And my latest release, MILK-BLOOD, featuresheroin addiction in a way I am pretty confident you have never seen before.None of my books preach or try todeny anyone the choice of their drug or drink. Hell, if I could get away withit, I’d be drinking right now. But I can’t. One shot of vodka and I’m drinkingfor days and then using any substance I can get my hands on. My insides bleedout of my ass (literally). Strange days indeed, and the glory is, writers canmake their characters bleed out just the same.So, for my 22 year sobrietyanniversary, I’m putting out a post called: “GettingYour Character High: Writing About Addiction”Herewe go…Torture your protagonist. Toss theminto a pot of boiling water, and make the best parts come bubbling up to thetop. There are lots of ways to do this, but one of the greatest and oft-usedways for authors is to write some drugs or drink into their system. Wether theyhave a longstanding addiction, are in recovery from addiction and relapse, ortake their first hit of that strange looking pill, a character under theinfluence is a pivotal point in many stories. Substances turn a characterinside out.  The filters are gone, the emotions are exaggerated, impulsecontrol is low, libido may be ablaze. Memories and demons and actions they willlater regret come rushing in.   Getting your character high issimilar to dropping them into that pot of boiling water. Here’s some things toconsider:What You Drop In MattersAll Substances are not equal. A tiny dot of crystal meth holds much more power than a drop of Pabst BlueRibbon, and the variances are tremendous. I’ve been around drinking in mysobriety without a problem, but I never want to be in the same room as methagain, for if I do not leave, there will be blood. Social marijuana use, socialalcohol use, and social crack use: One of these things is not like theother. Amounts and TermsGet it right. To make it feeltruthful, characters should use the right amount, the right away, with theright terms. “Weed” is the common vernacular for marijuana, right? And Dopedoesn’t mean “Weed” in my parts, maybe nowhere. Dope is particular to justheroin.  Of course, if you are writing fantasy or science fiction, thisall changes. Spoiled milk got the aliens high in “Alien Nation”, NZT-48 was anintellectual buzz in “Limitless” and Hobbits love their pipe-weed. Oh, theplaces you will go, just have inner-world consistency, and have some fun.Research If your character is getting high,or trying not to get high, then go to an open AA/NA meeting.  Find someYouTube videos of people using.  Listen to songs that capture the tone ofthe specific substance. (RIP Lou Reed).  I’m not saying to go snort somecoke, but, go snort some coke. No, don’t’ snort coke. Ask someone who snortedcoke to edit your work.  Or of course you could just snort some coke. (No,don’t!)RitualsAddicts love rituals. Your charactercan be on the outside looking in, and intimidated and beguiled by the strangeworld, or it can be part of their lexicon. Alcoholics love the ding of the bellas they enter the party store, the smell of old mop soap, seeing all thoselittle stogies at the counter. Heroin addicts come to welcome the prick of theneedle into their flesh, and the comfort of patting their front pocket andknowing there’s a pack of dope inside. Get this right, and the passages willread true to the reader. The scariest moment is always just before you startWhen recovering heroin addict Jane Margolis met Pinkman in Breaking Bad,you knew something had to give. Laying out the temptation and creating theset-up is a great plot builder.  If you can get readers screaming at yourcharacters in their head, \"don'tdo it, don't do it, no! don't!\" you've won them over. A character wecare about acting against their best interest is reason to read on.One generic scene I personallyhate is the character trying to stay sober, sitting at a bar stool ponderingover unresolvable troubles, and in front of them is the drink they justordered. They twirl the shot of whiskey and stare, deciding if they shoulddrink it. I can believe a lot of things, but not this. Once you are at thatpoint, you are already drunk. Cravings are intense, and if you’ve gonethat far, you’re not going to turn anything down, and certainly not pause. It’slike taking a laxative, and trying not take a shit. You may hold on for awhile, but eventually you will give in, and then it will get messy.But that moment before decisions aremade can make the reader's heart stop and their interest zoom in. All You Have to do is read thelabelsSubstances work with much betterconsistency than most things in our life.  In fact, the reason drugs areso enticing is that they work. Want to feel a certain way, there’s somethingout there for you.  Anything your character wants can be found in a drug.Confidence, creativity, strength, expansion of consciousness. Eventually  the drugs will do the opposite that you hoped for, but whilethe character is falling into the pits of hell, it can feel like flying.     \"Most people don't know how they're gonna feel from onemoment to the next. But a dope fiend has a pretty good idea. All you gotta dois look at the labels on the little bottles”Perceptions and ProseWhen characters uses substances,perceptions are altered, and this is where your prose should change. Firstperson point of view will certainly change the most, followed by third personlimited. The deeper you are in the POV the more affected the prose willbe. Make the sentences reflect thesubstance: Drunkards will have big, bold dreams, or violent impulses. Any gooddrunk is always telling you how much they love you or how much they hateyou.  Heroin will make you feel soft and warm, like a return to the wombwhere everything is beautiful and has its place; the ants in the grass are justdoing their thing. Cocaine will have your brain and tongue electric withtangential philosophies. Of course, the pain of craving forand detoxing from these substances will have a visceral effect unique to thesubstances. Making your characters detox and crave is twice as much fun asgetting them high. The possibilities are endless, and characters going throughthe cycle of addiction transform as much as any werewolf.Thought patterns and NarratorReliability.Characters getting high willrationalize insanity until their choices seem perfectly reasonable and actuallypreferable. Their internal dialogue will be filled with lies. What's more funwriting than that?Similar to this, there’s tons ofoptions to hide an addicts true intent with behavior that may seem contrary toexpectations.  Addicts lie, they deny, then they die. There’s a great passage in Michele Miller's upcoming novel(and ABNA semi-finalist), Lower Power, wherea craving crack cocaine addict can’t find a way to afford any drugs so insteadhe goes to visit his son. As we travel alongside him, we think this could be aredeeming quality, until he steals the very  necklace he gave his son fromaround his neck to pawn for crack money. That’s verity. Parents get higheveryday by selling back their kids Xbox games to Gamestop so they can get a 5dollar crack rock.SurroundingsUnlike the pits of hell formurderers and rapists, there are no fences in the pits of hell  foraddicts, for if an addict tries to climb out of their pit of hell, anotheraddict grabs them by the ankle and pulls them back down.  Want to put yourcharacter around some nastiness and see how they respond, send them to a crackhouse or a dive bar. It’s a pot of bubbling madness in there, and yourcharacter's madness is sure to boil right out of them just the same. So there’s some thoughts. Not sure if anyone is listening as I look around thetable, but that’s okay, this sharing is important for me and I'm grateful forthe chance.  I’d love to write a post on how to write someone newly sobersince sobriety to me has been stranger than any fiction or any addiction. Ittook a lot more courage to live stone cold sober 24 hours a day than to clutchonto that 40 ouncer like it’s my baby bottle. For a great read on a newly soberperson navigating reality filled with some wonderful humor, try “Unwasted: MyLush Sobriety” by Sacha Scoblic.For a great story on addiction thatI think will blow your mind to pieces, check out MILK-BLOOD$2.99for kindle $6.65paperbackThanks, Mark.

{"title": "INTERGNAT TROLLS", "date": "Thursday, June 26, 2014", "text": "Hi folks,Today, I happened upon a posting in the comments section ofan Amazon review I’d recently given on Dana King’s book GRIND JOINT. It’s by aguy who for some reason doesn’t use his name but goes by “Mr. Wizard”.Normally, I ignore the trolls who seem to populate the Intergnat, but felt Ihad to say something about this as it challenges my integrity. And, myintegrity is important to me, which is one reason I don’t hide behind somechickenshit alias…Here’s what the Wiz (who lives in Monterrey, California,which explains a lot…) said:MrWizard says:This perhaps would be a more persuasive review except thatthe reviewer has posted 44 similar superlatives, none rated less than 5 stars,since 2009. Apparently there's not a book he's read for which he has not hadthe same exuberant praise. First, to provide some context, I readan average of three and a half novels per week. Each and every week. That meansthat since 2009 I’ve read approximately 800 novels. In my house are literallythousands of novels and my Kindle is packed full. I buy novels, but I alsoreceive novels from friends and publishers to read, sometimes to review orblurb. Forty-four reviews for approximately 800 novels read seems about rightto me and that’s because of my personal review philosophy.Which is, I won’t write a review unlessI think it truly is worth five stars.Whether that’s a good philosophy or notis open for debate. It’s just my personal philosophy.See, I’m a writer, which means I kind ofknow what goes into writing a novel and then finding an agent and then findinga publisher and then finding readers. It’s hard, boobie. There’s just an awfullot of blood, sweat and tears (and luck!) involved. It’s actually a wonderthere are as many books published (legitimately—I’m not talking aboutself-publishing) as there are.With my first novel, I suffered 85rejections. That’s in the pre-Intergnat days when one had to send the mss viasnail mail and provide postage not only for sending the work but for the returnpostage. At a time—for me, anyway—in which we didn’t know where the rent orfood money was going to come from, most weeks, and could ill-afford the moneyspent on postage. And wait weeks and months for a reply. And, when it did finda publisher, it was only because of the advice literary agent Mary Evans gaveme and the rare good fortune it had in landing on the desk of a person who wasn’tgoing to even read it before sticking in the rejection slip, but whosesecretary had spilled her coffee and was preparing a new cup and she decided toread a page or two while waiting on her java. Those are the kinds of thingsthat are behind many books that find their way into print. Not to mention I’dspent a year and a half writing and rewriting it…So, yeah, when I pick up a book, I knowI don’t know the history of that book, but I do know that it most likely wasn’twhipped out in a day and a half and there was probably more than a bit ofsacrifice behind it.Sorry, but I’m not going to be the guywho takes a few hours to read it and then slap a two- or three-star rating onit. I just won’t publish a review that I don’t think is deserving of afive-star rating. This guy—Mr. Wizard—seems to be like more than one personamong us—he judges others’ lives by his own. I venture a guess that he readsabout 44 books in five years and reviews every single one. Which is what heseems to think that I’ve done. Sorry, panther-breath—that’s not even a third ofa year’s reading for moi.In fact, there are a bunch of writerswho I know and whose books I’ve read that I haven’t reviewed publicly.Sometimes, that’s because I don’t feel I could honestly give them a five-starreview. Not always—often I do think it deserves such a rating, but if Ireviewed every single book I read I wouldn’t have much time for reading otherbooks and that’s how I’d rather spend my time. In fact, when I find an author Ilike, I usually end up reading every single book he or she has published, but Iusually only review one book. It’s just a time thing.There are several writers who’ve askedme to review their books and I read them and told them (in private) that Iwouldn’t put my name on it—that it simply wasn’t that good. That’s notsomething I enjoy doing and I’m pretty sure they didn’t enjoy hearing. But, it’sthat integrity thing. And, more than one of them wrote another book and askedme to review it and that book was great and I gave them a review. A five-starreview. They’d earned it.Reviews are a funny animal. My idea ofthe perfect and best-written book of all time is THE STRANGER by Albert Camus.Recently, I went to Amazon and read a few of the reviews for it. One (well,more than one!) reviewer gave it three stars. Three stars! I looked up thisreviewer’s history and saw she’d reviewed books like FIFTY SHADES OF CRAP andJames Patterson novels and gave them five stars. That kind of illustrates the literaryacumen of some reviewers perfectly. I don’t have any problem with her givingfive stars to FIFTY SHADES, but I do kind of have an issue with giving a bookof true genius three stars. But then, as my old pappy used to say: “Considerthe source.”Which might have been the trigger forMr. Wiz’s comments. I kind of dissed those kinds of books in my review of Dana’sbook. Perhaps he feels those are examples of good literature…Who knows? The only thing I know is that as a rule, someone who doesn’t havethe trouser beans to use his real name behind his comments is what we used tocall, in the days before political correctness—a chickenshit. (My apologies tochickens everywhere…)Am I pissed? Well… yeah. Mostly, I’djust like to meet Mr. Wiz and whiz on him…Rant over… but one last thing. If Ireview a book on this blog or anywhere and give it five stars, I’ve not onlyread a pile of books I didn’t review, but that it absolutely was a five-starread for me.You can count on it.Blue skies,LesP.S. I'm aware that the common wisdom is to simply ignore these kinds of assholes but sometimes they're just so much of a punk that it's hard to. And, I'm not commenting on a bad review he gave me, but to his challenging my integrity, so hope that counts for something."},
{"title": "Dana King freebies!", "date": "Wednesday, June 25, 2014", "text": "Hi folks,Awhile back, I posted areview of Dana King’s novel, GRIND JOINT, which I loved.Recently nominated for a Shamus award, Dana King is making all four of hise-books available for free on Kindle from June 25 – 29. A Small Sacrifice isthe nominated book, the story of private detective Nick Forte and what happenswhen he tries to clear a man’s name and discovers why it had been muddied inthe first place. The other freebies include two books from Dana’s Penns Riverseries, set in an economically depressed Western Pennsylvania town: WorstEnemies, and Grind Joint; as well as Wild Bill, the story of how an FBIinvestigation into Chicago’s organized crime goes awry when a mob war breaksout.Here’s my review of GRINDJOINT, as originally posted:I read tons and tons ofbooks. Last count, I’m averaging 3 ½ novels a week. That’s a lot. The trulygreat ones I try to provide reviews for. At last count, I’m about 15 booksbehind. Here’s one I read several weeks ago and just re-read it. For the thirdtime. That kind of tells you how I liked it, I think. But, if that wasn’t a bitenough clue, here are some other thoughts I had about it:GRIND JOINT by Dana KingOne of the best novels I’veread this year. Period. I’d read three of King’s novels previous to this oneand waited and waited for it to become available on Kindle and finally I wentahead and bought the paperback copy, simply because I couldn’t wait any longer.(Note: get the other three—they’re as good as this one is.)I’m glad I did. Not so muchbecause I finally got to read it—that’s a for-sure plus—but because I’ve nowgot a physical copy. That’s important because there are dozens and dozens oftechniques I want to steal for my own writing and to pass on to my writingstudents and this just makes it easier to bookmark and make the theft and getout before I’m caught.In some of the reviews I’dread of GRIND JOINT, it was often mentioned that King was bringing back to lifethe subgenre of mafia crime books. I guess I’m out of touch—I never realized ithad died. Well, if it had, this definitely gave the genre new life. And, if ithasn’t, this is pumping steroids into it. Make room at the table, Mario Puzo…Reviews very often aren’tabout the book itself so much as they are about the reviewer. Some see that asa negative. Not this reviewer. Sure, the plot is complex and sound. Sure, thecharacters are entirely interesting and plausible. Sure, the world it containsis realistic and well-drawn. But, I read differently than someone who’s not awriter and is just looking for a great way to kill some time. GRIND JOINT doesthat for sure, but what impressed me more than anything is that I consciouslylooked for weak places—places I could set it down easily and go and dosomething else. Well, very few books are capable to achieving that kind ofeffect on me… but this one did. It’s simply Grade A, Top Quality, SterlingSilver. 24-Carat Can’t-Put-It-Down.Trust me on this. Better: Don’t trust me. Grab a copy and see if I’m not right.I couldn’t find a single page anywhere in it that didn’t grab and hold myinterest. Not a single page.If you like an insider’slook at the criminal world and are intrigued at stories that reveal how people “inthe life” think and what drives their actions, this is the book for you. If youenjoy stories that draw back the curtain on the seamy side of town as well ason the good side of the tracks, this is the book for you. If you get youradrenaline going when you encounter tales where you see behind the curtain,this is the book for you.If you prefer novels about vampiresand fifty ways to make your eyeballs bleed and your trouser worm get exercise,and characters that are 6’8”, Hollywood-blond, can bench-press Buicks, go 24hours without sleep, food or water, and can defeat 9,000 ninjas in warehouses(why are these guys always in warehouses?), and only need a toothbrush and amicro chip inside them that draws bad guys to their vicinity like six-year-oldsto chicken nuggets to make their lives complete, then this probably isn’t thebook for you.On the other hand, if you’relike one reviewer who said she finished reading this book “on a gurney in anemergency room with crying kids, a car accident victim and a loud drunk”keeping her company, and she “barely noticed them,” then, yeah, this is yourkind of book.It’s exactly like that.Here’s a short descriptionof the four free books:ASmall Sacrifice. Nominated for a Shamus Award for Best Indie PI Novel,it’s the story of Chicago investigator Nick Forte, who is asked to clear thename of a man who has been publicly vilified as the murderer of his young son.Forte learns, while Doug Mitchell might not be guilty, he’s no innocent, andthe circumstances place Forte and his family in jeopardy.Grind Joint. Named by The LA Reviewof Books as one of the fifteen best noir reads of 2013, Grind Joint is the story of what happens in a small, economicallydepressed Pennsylvania town when someone gets the bright idea of solving theirfinancial woes by building a low-roller casino. The local cops find themselvesup against more than they bargained for when the Russian mob takes an interest.A Small Sacrifice’s Nick Forte playsa supporting but pivotal role.Worst Enemies. The first of thePenns River books, the story of what can happen when someone takes the scenarioof Strangers on a Train way too seriously.Detectives Ben Dougherty and Willie Grabek have to solve two murders organizedby a person who is close to both victims, yet operates at some distance.Wild Bill. A standalone tale of FBISpecial Agent Willard “Wild Bill” Hickox, who’s ready to retire but wants toput the cherry on his career by bringing down Chicago’s Number One crime boss.When a gang war re-arranges all the players, Will must choose between duty,experience, and a combination of the two if he is to ride off into the sunsetas planned.Blue skies,Les"},

A safe cracking thiefextraordinaire, Jake has long moved on from his criminal ways in favour offamily life and the dream of owning his own business; a hair salon.

Lee and I met a few years ago at a Bouchercon and have become great friends. He's a terrific writer and I'm delighted to help give him and his work a bit of additional exposure. He also provides some great tips for writers here. Without further ado, here's Lee...From Lee Thompson's desk...(Lee and his nephew Austin)A Texas Senator andhis wife go missing… On the same day, their son is slaughtered by an enigmatickiller on the lawn of ex-Governor Edward Wood's residence. Sammy, Wood's drugdealing son, suspects his father of the crime. After all, his old man snappedonce before and crippled his wife with a lead pipe. But there's something moreto these events…something deeper and festering just beneath the surface…In direct oppositionto Homicide Detective Jim Thompson, Sammy begins an investigation of his own,searching for the truth in a labyrinth of lies, deception, depravity andviolence that drags him deeper into darkness and mayhem with each step. And indoing so, brings them all into the sights of an elusive and horrifying killerwho may not be what he seems.A brutal killer on arampage of carnage…a hardened detective on the brink…an antihero from theshadows…a terrifying mystery that could destroy them all…Welcome to Lee Thompson’s A BEAUTIFUL MADNESS blog tour!This blog, and the others participating, will receive a paperback copy to giveto a random reader who leaves a comment and shares this post. Throughout the book tour, I’ll be sharing fun facts about myfirst Mystery/Thriller, and also offering dubious advice to novice writersbecause I’ve had writers and editors farther along the path than myself give metips that have helped me tremendously. If you want to up your game, payattention and pass what you find useful on to those in your critique groups.If you’re here as a reader, thanks so much. You’re everyauthor’s life source. You’re the yin to our yang. The stories we set down onpaper don’t seem to exist until someone else has read them, and the more themerrier. First/Easy Ideas (Arethey worth writing?)A writer (let’s call him Charles) gets an idea andimmediately starts writing his story. The excitement of that idea might helphim finish it, and then later, looking back a month or year from now, Charleswill probably find that certain elements of his story still interest him (thatquick bit of snappy dialogue, or a certain description) but with moreexperience and distance he’ll probably also find what had seemed amazing duringthe creative portion now reads and feels only ho-hum. I think lots of easy ideas are a waste of time. Many amanuscript isn’t sellable because the first idea that strikes Charles’ fancyhas occurred to ten thousand other writers, and the same idea will find tenthousand other writers next year. Editors want fresh ideas, ideas only youcould write. Yet it’s understandable why Charles loves ideas like this. They’reeasy to write. But they’re also incredibly predictable.If you want to write something more original you have toresist the easy ideas that are more than likely someone else’s vision, and findyour own. As a reader, picking up a book where Charles copies a Lee Child, orStephen King, or Dean Koontz idea,the copy comes off terribly tepid. And it’s sad in a way, because in Charles’deluded mind—I’m speaking from experience, I’m very deluded—he will believethat his creation is nearly as goodas Child or King or Koontz. I believe experience is the best teacher, and we can getbetter at judging the value of our ideas nearly instantaneously, which is kindof cool.Want to read some Crime novels with interesting and freshideas? Check out THE RAPIST by Les Edgerton, and FEAST DAY OF FOOLS by JamesLee Burke, they’re two of my favorites. In A BEAUTIFUL MADNESS I wanted to avoid a lot of the Crimetropes I’ve read in a lot of other novels. Luckily my heroes paved the way bywriting their own stories instead of taking the easy, boring, predictableroute. In their novels, and in my own, the story is about more than just onemain character, which is nice because it adds depth to the story and brings outsides of every character that might have otherwise been unattainable.

Top Tips: Recommended Reads   May 31, 2014 by Paul D. Brazill     Galviston by Nic PizzolattoHaunting and hard-hitting, Nic Pizzolatto’s Galveston is a fantastic spin on the man-on-the run sub-genre of harboiled crime fiction. Prose as tight as a snare drum. Dashes of lyricism that never overpower the storytelling. Great, realistic characters and situations. Marvellous stuff.Just Like That by Les EdgertonJust Like That has it all. Great dialogue, whipcrack scenes and meaty characters haul you along on a hardboiled crime road-trip worthy of the Elmore Leonard and Joe R Lansdale. This then transforms into a terrific look at life behind bars. Most of all, this is a brilliant charter study full of a love of life and you can see why Edgerton has been described as a mixture of Charles Bukowski and Eddie Bunker. A shot to the heart as well as the head, Just Like That is highly recommended.Phone Call From Hell and Other Tales Of The Damned by Jonathan Woods.Jonathan Woods’ latest collection is a belter. The quirky and inventive collection starts off with quotes from Anthony Burgess and the Coen Brothers and leads with a story called ‘The Handgun’s Tale’ which is just that – the world from the perspective of a gun.Other gems include the title story in which an eternal loser gets a phone call from Charles Manson, ‘The Old Man’ is classic and classy, ‘The Other Suitcase’, the story of Kafka’s missing smut and ‘Hearing Voices,’ which has a smart and funny twist on the femme fatale trope. ‘Crash & Burn,’ the final story, is a cinematic, high octane thriller. Rich writing full of strong images. Twisted and funny and brilliant.White Rabbit by K A LaityK A Laity’s White Rabbit is a marvelous and potent cocktail of crime fiction, screwball comedy and the supernatural. A cracking yarn choc full of brilliant lines that reminds you of Wodehouse, Preston Sturges and the Coen Brothers and yet is like nothing you’ve ever read before. Fantastic stuff. More please!Hard-Boiled Witch: Hocus Pocus, You’re Dead by K A LaityWith her new short story series, Hard-Boiled Witch, K A Laity once again mixes crime fiction, the supernatural and smart writing to come up with a lethal cocktail. Marvellous.The Killer Among Us by George BeckThe Killer Among Us is classy stuff. A gripping and engrossing study of American small town life with echoes of Jim Thompson and John Steinbeck.A Man Alone by David SiddallDavid Siddall’s brilliantly hard-boiled debut novella A Man Alone is a gripping urban western worthy of a Walter Hill filmAll Due Respect Magazine 2The second issue of All Due Respect magazine is a 100% gem. Owen Laukkanen is the star of this issue with N.F.G, a brilliant take on the fisherman’s yarn, as well as an excellent interview with Chris F. Holm and an insight into the story. This is followed by a sharp slice of Gothic grunge from C S DeWildt. Other cracking stories, including the remarkable The Gulf by Scott Alderberg and Ice Cold Alibi a great piece of old school noir from the ever brilliant Eric Beetner. But every story is a gem and the reviews which finish off this issue are also well worth a read."},
{"title": "MATT HILTON - GENIUS AT VILLAINS", "date": "Saturday, May 24, 2014", "text": "Hi folks,Still working on a post about my adventures in Texas, but in the meantime, I want to shout the praises of the most recent Matt Hilton thriller I just finished. I've read everything Matt has out and just want him to write faster--I'm jonsing for another one!I was fortunate enough to meet Matt at the Bouchercon in Cleveland--at least I think it was in Cleveland, although with my memory, it could have been in Albany. We kept trying to get together to drown some suds, but alas, never were able to. Next time...Here's the blurb I recently gave him for NO GOING BACK...Blurb for NO GOING BACKI had to read the ending of Matt Hilton’s latest thriller,NO GOING BACK, more than once. Why? To avoid nightmares, that’s why. To becomeas reasonably sure as I could be that Hilton’s latest villain, Samuel Logan,has been incapacitated. I think he is, but one can never be sure with a Hiltonbad guy. The best-named bad guy in literary history—and yes, I’m aware of a guynamed Hannibal Lector—is, hands-down, Tubal Cain. That sucker just kept comingback and coming back… Logan is a worthy heir. For one thing, you can shoot hima bunch of times and the guy doesn’t even feel it. Just keeps on coming afteryou. How are you going to go to sleep knowing he’s out there somewhere? I’lltell you what—I love reading Lee Childs’ thrillers, but for the life of me I havea hard time remembering who Jack Reacher went up against. With Joe Hunter, Iknow all of ‘em, up close and personal to where I can describe their breath.Hot and nasty, just like they all are.. Dantalion, Luke Rickard and TubalCain—just aren’t folks you forget when you put the book down. Samuel Loganextends Hilton’s legacy once again. This is just a superb thriller It's theposter child for thrillers. I lost a lot of sleep as I couldn’t lay my headdown until I finished it. Wondering if Samuel Logan is perhaps still out therewill most likely cost me some more uneasy nights.That's it, but... I cannot recommend this book enough! Get it and you'll thank me. Then, if you haven't already, pick up his other Joe Hunter books. Check out the villains--they're brilliant.Blue skies,Les"},
{"title": "SPINETINGLER MAGAZINE REVIEW OF THE BITCH", "date": "Friday, May 16, 2014", "text": "Hi folks,I returned from a grueling two weeks in Texas yesterday and am thoroughly exhausted. It was one of the most intense periods of my life, both for the quality of the two writing events I was privileged to present at and the unfortunate decline of my health. I have COPD and it really accelerated during my stay there. I'm still exhausted and trying to recuperate so won't post much today and will try to post more about my time at the DFW Writer's Convention in Dallas and the WRW event at the Purple Sage Ranch outside of San Antonio, and my time spent with my buddy Bob Stewart at his house in San Antonio as soon as I get some strength back, but wanted to share something that I got while at WRW a couple of days ago--a wonderful review of The Bitch by the awesome Spinetingler Magazine that really perked my spirits up just when I needed a lift.Below, is the review that Peter Dragovich, the Nerd of Noir, posted in Spinetingler. SPINETINGLER MAGAZINEThe Bitch by Les Edgerton – review   May 13, 2014Les Edgerton’s The Bitch is a straight-up old-school noir novelthat will pin your ass to the break table at lunch at make you late for work.It’s a story told by ex-con, now-hairdresser Jake Bishop, a guy on the vergeof living the American Dream. He’s got a beautiful wife, his own house and he’sabout to open his own salon in South Bend, Indiana. But then Walker Joy, hisold cellmate from Pendleton, comes asking for a favor: help him rip off a jewelerat the request of another jeweler who has some shit over Walker Joy’s head. Atfirst Jake begs off but then Walker ‘fesses up that this jeweler has shit onJake as well. Now Jake has to risk losing everything in order to get out ofthis jam alive or worse: catching “the bitch” of the title, the life longprison stretch that inevitably happens following a criminal’s third felony.Edgerton sets all this up masterfully and then brings the hurt down onBishop one catastrophe after another. If you’re worried in the early stretchesof The Bitch that Edgerton won’t go “full-dark” (as the Nerdadmittedly was) let me put your fears to rest: this shit gets truly fucked upin act two and beyond fucked up in act three. So if your idea of a good timewith a book involves stomach problems (which we all know is the only type ofreader who would look to the opinion of some asshole calling himself the Nerd of Noir), then The Bitch should be the next beast perched atop yourTBR pile. I was really hurting when this appeared on my puter that morning and it helped put a new spring in my step! Thanks, Spinetingler and Peter Dragovitch!Blue skies,Les"},

Then, Carl heads home to Oakland, CA, and Bob and I mosey on out to the Purple Sage Ranch north of San Antonio for 8 days at the WRW. I'm consulting a manual right now to find out which is the head and which is the rear end of a horse just in case they want to mosey up some doggies or whatever they do...The director of WRW, Jason Sitzes, just told me they have a couple of openings left for the WRW retreat so I told him I'd post the info here in case somebody's looking for a place to hook up and do some serious writing and mingling with other writer folks.

She began an internship with Kimberley  Cameron & Associates in the fall of 2012. During the internship she  discovered a passion for assisting others to develop their stories and  helping books reach readers. She especially loves developmental editing. Now  she balances three jobs: author, editor, and agent, and finds that the  experience in each helps and supports the other. She appreciates literary  fiction in the style of Herman Hesse, Jane Austen, or John Steinbeck. She  also loves a good commercial book. Commercially she is looking for unusual fantasy,  grounded science-fiction, and atypical romance. Strong female characters and  unique cultures especially catch her eye. Although she will not consider most  non-fiction, stories about any kind of dance or native and pagan cultures may  interest her.NYT Bestselling  Novelist Grant Blackwood  The New  York Times bestselling  author of the Briggs Tanner series, (The End of Enemies, The  Wall of Night,  and An Echo of War) Grant Blackwood is also  the co-author of the Fargo Adventure Series (Spartan  Gold, Lost  Empire,  and The Kingdom) with Clive Cussler, as  well as the co-author of the #1 NYT bestseller, Dead  or Alive,  with Tom Clancy, and the upcoming thriller, The  Kill Switch,  with James Rollins.

{"title": "INTERVIEW WITH TONY BLACK", "date": "Tuesday, April 29, 2014", "text": "Hi folks,Haven't had much time to tend to the ol' blog and I'm getting ready to head out to Texas to participate in a workshop and a retreat in Dallas and on a dude ranch near San Antonio, so I thought I'd repost an interview I participated in with British bestselling author Tony Black. It's raw and nothing is held back in this one, so... beware...Hey LesGreat you're up for the interview - it's a lengthy one, Ihope that's okay!Some of the questions aren't questions, more likestatements: just comment on those, please.I may fire over some follow-ups if that's okay.Thanks again, you're a gentleman.Tony.Thankyou, Tony, for this opportunity—I appreciate it, sir! Especially from such a well-regarded andbrilliant writer as yourself. As for the “gentleman” bit, you may change yourmind after reading some of my answers…I've done quite a few of these interviews now,Les, and I have to say this is the first where I don't know where to start - tosay you've led a colourful life is a bit of an understatement . . .Let's start at the start, then. You've said 'dysfunctional families germinatewriters' - discuss . . .I think if you talk to just about any writer worthy of the name,you’ll find they came from a dysfunctional family. It’s abackground that just germinates writers. Think about it—if you grow up in a happyfamily, you wouldn’t have anything to write about and you’d probably end up sellinginsurance. Fiction is about one thing only—trouble—andif you’ve never had much trouble in your life, you won’thave anything to write about or probably even understand what trouble is.I was at a writer’s thing one time where Mary Karr (THE LIAR’S CLUB) was appearing andshe made the statement that all writers come from a dysfunctional background.All of us writer-types standing around nodded sagely at this precept and thensomeone asked if she could define a dysfunctional family. Karr laughed andsaid, “That’s easy. A dysfunctional family is any family with more than twomembers.”Tolstoysaid it the best in ANNA KARENINA with the line: “Happy families are all alike; everyunhappy family is unhappy in its own way.”My own familywas fucked up in just about every way they could have been. My mother was areligious fanatic—“fanatic” isn’ta strong enough word for what she was and is—and my father was basically a brutewho abused me in just about every way you can imagine. My father didn’t spank me. He whipped me with variousobjects, including a live king snake, and usually would taunt me to fist-fighthim and when I got bigger would do the same saying that I ever whipped him, he’d just go get a 2X4 and take care ofme like that. Nice guy… My mother did her part in the abuse department, mostlyemotionally and mentally.Two yearsago, at the age of 68, I discovered the man I had been told was my father allmy life wasn’t.To compound the injury, my mother named me after him—I’m a frickin’ junior!—and to this day won’t tell me who my real father is.However, she claims God has forgiven her. I guess lying to your son for all ofhis life doesn’trequire forgiveness in her mind…A lot of writers also talk about the influence of a big reader in their family- I believe your grandmother was the big reader.Yes. She had a library better than the public one in our town ofFreeport, Texas. And, she didn’t believe in limiting what I read because of some age bullshit.The first writer I read at the age of five was Guy de Maupassant. Never did the“Hardy Boys” thing like many kids—didn’tread one of those until I was in my twenties and out of curiosity. After I readone, I’m thankful I wasn’t given that to read for my first reading experience or I mighthave become… an insurance salesman… And your mother force-fed you the bible three or four times a year, didn't she?Well, we read the entire Bible three or four times a year. We readit every single day—an average of probably three chapters a day.Did anything particularly stay with you from those Bible readings in childhoodinto your adult life?Oh, absolutely. Until very recent times, most of our great Westernliterature owes much to the Bible and Shakespeare. I always feel kind of sorryfor readers who aren’t familiar with the Bible when they read a work like NO COUNTRYFOR OLD MEN, as they’re missing a lot of the meat of a book like that. Not to mentionFaulkner or James Lee Burke or any number of great writers.I'm almost itching to ask you about the later stuff but the early experiencesseem important to you - you moved about a lot when you were young, didn't you?If by “a lot” you mean several times a year, then yep. One of mywives can remember her third grade teacher’s name—I don’teven remember what state I was in in the third grade. Probably several. Infact, until I hit my forties, I’d never lived in more than one place for more than two years max.I loved moving, especially when I got older in junior high and high school. Itmeant I got to reinvent myself each time and get rid of the stuff that I didn’tlike each time. It also meant a lot more action with the opposite sex. Girls inhigh school like the new guy. He’s exciting and exotic in away ol’ Jimmy who they’ve known since the first grade isn’t. I always tried to takeadvantage of that.You mentioned one of your wives - how many times have you beenmarried?Five times. One only lasted an hour so maybe Ishouldn’t count that one… I guess I should explain that one now that I’vementioned it, right?Well, Lucille (not her real name) and I had thekind of relationship that led to our splitting up. What I mean by that is thatwe each had interests the other didn’t share and we pursued those with others.For instance, Lucille liked to bowl and I’d rather get my toenails pulled outthan go near a bowling alley. So, she had a male friend she went bowling within a mixed-doubles league. No funny business going on—they just shared thatinterest. I love music—all kinds, from C&W, to rock, to opera, toclassical—whatever. If it’s done well, I love all forms of music. At the time,I subscribed to the South Bend Symphony and attended their classical music symphonies.Lucille hated classical music, so I went with a female friend who also enjoyedit. Again, nothing sexual going on—just two friends who enjoyed the same thing.Well, we lived together for quite a few months andgot along wonderfully. From time to time, we talked about getting married butnever did. And then, one Saturday night we had a “salad” party (that’s whereall the guests bring 10-20 pills with them and dump them into a salad bowl andyou just reach in and take a handful, not knowing what you’re taking… Needlessto say, most folks get pretty fucked up. And we did. We woke up the next day,hung over, still high, and decided to get married. We drove up to Michigan,just across the line, and found a justice of the peace and got married. We returned home, had a little “honeymoon” andthen I took a shower and came out wearing a suit. “Where are you going?”Lucille said, and I reminded her that it was the last symphony of the year.“Oh,” she said. “Well, have a good time and I’ll see you when you get home.”And I left like that. Everything was hunky-dory.When I got home, she was gone and had left anangry note. Something to the effect that I was an “insensitive bastard” forleaving on our wedding day and she never wanted to see me again. I figured outinstantly what was going on. I figured she called her mom who hated me and toldher the news and her mother probably said something like, “Let me speak to thegroom,” and found out I’d gone to the concert and began yammering how“insensitive” I was, et al. I imagined that Lucille was just experiencing coldfeet and I was pretty sure that if I just went over to her folks’ house andcopped a few deuces, I could talk her into coming back.But… I was having cold feet myself. Good riddance,I thought, and packed up my shit and drove down to my folks’ house. I spent thenext day calling people to find a landing place and got hold of an old friendof mine in Bermuda—Wendell Burgess, a black gay guy—and he said, sure, Les—comeon over and you can stay with me and work in my store. He owned a photographyshop on Queen Street in Hamilton. Wendell was always a gentleman—I knew hewanted to nail me but had never been overbearing about it. I bought a planeticket and flew to Bermuda and stayed with Wendell for a week and eventuallygot my own place and another job as a bouncer at Danny’s Hideaway, a sleazy bar(yes, Bermuda has sleazy bars…). I ended up living in Bermuda for about a yearand got tired of it and came back to Indiana. When I got off the plane, I toldthe cabbie to take me to my folks’ place—I was going to stay there until Ifigured out where to go next—I was thinking Mexico maybe—and on the way there,I changed my mind and told the guy to drop me off at this bar in South Bend Iused to hang out at. I thought maybe I’d run into some old friends and get aparty going for that night.Well, I walked into this bar and it was aroundnoon and outside it was bright sunshine and inside it was dark, which made ithard to see. I sat down at the bar and saw there were only three of us there.Me, the bartender, and this girl sitting down at the other end. She lookedattractive, so I called down to her and asked if I could buy her a drink andshe said, sure. I picked up my drink and walked down and sat next to her andlooked at her closer and she looked familiar but I couldn’t place her. “Hey,cookie,” I said. “You’re going to think this is the biggest cornball lineyou’ve ever heard, but you really look familiar.” She looked at me, laughed,and said, “I should. We used to be married.”It was Lucille! As soon as I realized that, Igrabbed her drink and said, “Gimme that. I’m not buying you a drink.” Well, Iwas just kidding—I slid it back and laughed.As it turned out, what had been just a regularneighborhood bar when I left town had been changed into a stripper club and shewas working there as a stripper. It was her day off and she’d just come inearly to pick up her check.We talked and I found out what had happened. WhenI left, her dad tried to get our marriage annulled, but since we’d gone out ofstate, they wouldn’t allow it, so they had to file for a divorce. It took sixweeks to get the divorce—based on abandonment. So, technically, I was marriedfor six weeks, but since I was only with her about an hour after I said “I do”I count it as my hour marriage…And, she wanted to get together, go out, but Isaid no. I don’t do strippers. Are you kidding? Only losers do strippers!Do you think you were you sub-consciously gathering material for your writingwhen you were on the road?Nothing subconscious about it at all. It was a decidedly consciouseffort. Ever since I read my first book I knew I was going to be a writer andhave never wavered for a second from that. And, up until a few years ago, Ibelieved that the way you became a better writer was by accumulatingexperiences, a la the Jack London School of Writing, and that’s allI was ever after. A few years ago, I read a Flannery O’Connor interview in whichshe said that if a person grew up in the same house in the same town for herfirst seventeen years, she had all the material she’d ever need as a writer.Kind of wish I’d heard that long ago—it would have saved me alot of grief!I name checked the Kerouac novel there to be a smart-arse - you do believewriting should be experiential, don't you?Of course. If it’s not, it’s not writing. It’s typing.There's plenty of material in Les Edgerton's experience, can we take a fewhighlights - or lowlights - and talk about them? Let's start with your timeworking as a gigolo 'servicing older women' . . . I don’t know if I’d term it as being a “gigolo.” Well, maybe it was. What happenedwas one of those strokes of luck. I had one of my girlfriends, Cat, stabanother girlfriend, Rachele, and almost kill her and try to nail me as well. Igot the knife away from her and took Rachele to the emergency room. When I waswaiting there, Rachele’s mom showed up with this guy and told me that if Rachele died, Iwould too and the guy with her would be the one to render me room temperature.Turns out, she was connected and that’s exactly what this guy wouldhave done. Well, it’s what he would have tried to do—I wasn’texactly helpless. Anyway, Rachele pulled through and we began to date heavier,which was tricky as she couldn’t move much or she’d pull her stitches out. Anyway, she and her mother both workedfor a guy who was kind of a criminal kingpin. He had a cottage industry wherehe hired older women like Rachele’s mom to make thesefishing lures in their home ala piece work, and to grease the deals with thenational buyers of stores like K-Mart, he gave the buyers lots of coke andweed. He also had a regular drug business and used people like Rachele whenthey were under the age of 18 to transport his drugs from Houston to NewOrleans. If they got busted, since they were underage they’djust get probation and he’d never use them again. Rachele was over 18 but had never beencaught, so she was still working for him.Well, after she got out of the hospital, I started going with herto Houston and that was an experience. We’d go to this Quonset hutwarehouse with tons and tons of weed piled high and all of these illegal aliensmoving pallets of weed around with forklifts. Quite a sight. Anyway, the guywho Rachele and her mother worked for and me got to be friends and he hadanother sideline business—an escort service where young studly dudes like myself went outwith older, wealthy women. I’d made several stag movies years ago when I was 18 and living inBermuda and he found out about that and asked me to work for the escortbusiness.It forces you to learn to be creative in the sack . . . Myfavorite client was the heir to the famous Ponchartrain Hotel—shewas in her eighties and actually still fairly good-looking. She took me toPuerta Vallarta with her and her girlfriend. She rented the villa that used tobelong to Richard Burton and Liz Taylor and it was a really fun week!That's a book right there, Les . . .I think you’re right. And, I have one…I'm serious, you've led the kind of life that if it was put on thescreen people would accuse you of making it up . . . is there a memoir on thecards?I’vehad a memoir written for years, titled ADRENALINE JUNKIE. Just looking for theright publisher. Actually, it was sold at one point to the University of NorthTexas Press. You may find this story interesting.I’dsold my first two works of fiction to UNT—a novel and a collection of shortstories—and the editor, Charlotte Wright and the publisher, Fran Vick, signedAdrenaline Junkie—except it was titled MY SECRET LIFE in those days. That’sbecause I was hiding my past from everyone in those days. I thought it wouldhurt me for jobs and stuff (like dating so-called “decent” girls) if peopleknew I was an ex-con.Anyway,they sent me a contract and I was assigned a copy editor and we began to workon an edit. A couple of weeks after this happened, Fran retired and Charlotteresigned to take the job as managing editor of the University of Iowa Press, aposition she still holds.Thatweek, I took a trip to Hollywood to meet Paul Bennett, who had just signed meas my manager for film projects. I happened to have the hard copy of my memoiras I was doing edits on it and told him of the sale and he asked if he couldread it. The next morning, he told me he’d stayed up all night and read itstraight through. Anyone who knows anything about Hollywood knows these guysnever read, so that was a huge compliment. Before Paul became a manager, he’dbeen the V.P. of HBO and was the guy who created the Comedy Relief specials. Heasked if I’d mind if he showed my mss to his best friend, the president of HBO.Uh… duh? Of course, I said.Well,this guy called Paul the next morning and said he’d done the same as Paul.Stayed up all night reading it. And these guys never read anything! Paul hadtold him it was sold to UNT and he asked that I not show it to anyone else inthe movie industry, that they wanted it. He told Paul that it “was a Permanent Midnight, but with balls.” Hesaid they wanted to wait until it was published and gathered reviews andperhaps some awards or nominations so that it had an audience and that they’dmake the film.Greatnews, eh? Well, not so much as it turned out…Aweek or so after I returned home, the editor who had been assigned to medropped off my grid. Didn’t return emails and then phone calls. I finally gothold of the new chief editor and my world fell apart. He claimed they couldn’t “findmy contract,” so I didn’t have one. In a panic, I called Charlotte at Iowa andshe said she’d been expecting my call. She said the new guy was doing the samething to all the authors she’d signed. That he wanted his own stable of writersand was claiming to not have contracts for us. Which was insane, since bookcontracts there had to be vetted and okayed by their board of trustees or regents or whatever. Icouldn’t find my contract as my bookkeeping and record-keeping is… well… bad. Iknow it’s here still somewhere, but where in the stacks of papers and books Idon’t have a clue. Charlotte said she’d be glad to send me a copy of it and shealso said that since I did have a contract, I could sue and they’d have topublish it. But, she said, “Do you want someone to publish your book whodoesn’t want to?”Well,no, I said. I guess not. I called my then-agent and told him what happened andhe said not to worry. He’d find a publisher for it. But, first, he wanted tosell a new novel of mine and then he’d get a new publisher and for a lot moremoney. So, I ceased talking to UNT and got on with my life.Wait.It gets worse… My agent at the time—Jimmy Vines—took the novel I’d justwritten, titled THE PERFECT CRIME, and thought it was so good he put it up forauction. That was an exciting time. I was getting phone calls every fiveminutes from him with updates. Finally, it came down to between St. Martin’sand Random House as the others dropped out. St. Martin’s offered $50,000 andRandom House offered $45,000. Jimmy gave me my choice and I made the worstdecision of my life. I took the lower offer because… it was Random House.St.Martin’s wanted to publish it as it was—not change a single comma. In fact, theywanted at least two more books with the character.Theeditor who took it for Random House was Scott Moyer who had just come over fromVillard as a senior editor and mine was the first book he signed for R.H.Later, I don’t think he’d even read it—I don’t know this for sure, but I thinkhe just got caught up in the excitement of the auction and bid on it. Firstthing he did was change the title to OVER EASY. He thought there’d be more andsince it was set in New Orleans he changed the title to reflect the town (theBig Easy).AnnGodoff, the president of R.H. called my agent and told him she loved the bookand that when it came out it would not only be a bestseller, it would come outat #1 on the bestseller list. She could promise that because she said bestsellerlists are determined by copies printed, not sales. It would be coming outsimultaneously in paper from Ballantine and hardcover from R.H. And they wereprinting 50,000 copies in paper and 5,000 in hardback, which would guarantee itwould open at #1. Big stuff for what they considered a first novel. My futurewas assured! At the time, I owned a hairstyling salon and we were at the pointwhere our five-year lease was up and I had to make a decision whether to keepon cutting hair or become a full-time writer. I made the wrong decision… But, Ihad a deal from R.H., had a memoir that HBO wanted and what better time?Sorrythis has turned into a book on its own! Anyway, to make a long story somewhatshort, during that period Bertlesmann bought Random House and they beganjettisoning books. Mine among them. I ended up getting $12,500 in my firstinstallment and never a dime after that. They cancelled the book. Which I’drewritten eight times for Moyer. At the end, he said, “I wish you wrote likeRussell Banks.” That’s when I lost it for the first time and fired off an angryemail and that was the end of our “relationship.”Afew years ago, I talked to an old-school agent I respect very much and told himthe story and he nodded and said it made perfect sense from his own experienceswith them. He said that Random House always put out this fiction that theynever turned down a book once it was contracted for but that they did it allthe time, only used other reasons to turn them down so they could maintain thatfiction. Live and learn… The thing is, it’s impacted my life financially and upto this very day.Myagent, Jimmy, said he’d never heard of such shoddy treatment of an author andthat he’d never deal with Random House again. That should have tipped me off asto where he was, but it didn’t. He was going to refuse business with thebiggest house in the business because of what they did to this little unknownin Indiana? In those days I guess I had just fallen off the turnip truck…Whichleads me (finally!) to the end of this. Because the novel deal disintegrated,my memoir lay languishing in a drawer. Where it’s lain until today…Onemore thing. In your question, you said: “…if it was put on the screen peoplewould accuse you of making it up.” You’re right. Especially after James Freyand all that mess. In fact, a good friend of mine, writer Bob Stewart, read itand said he believed it all except one part where I describe a day where I wentto bed with five different girls. Well, I’d toned it down just for that reason.It was actually seven girls and I know that people judge other’s lives by theirown so they probably wouldn’t believe the truth, simply because of their ownexperiences. When Bob said that, I knew I couldn’t win, so I said fuck it andrewrote the truthful version.Thething is, I’ve had weeks in my lifewhere more happened than in other people’s entire lives. I’ve really done someshit—major shit. And a great deal of it isn’t in the memoir. It would simply betoo long and I’ve left off the past thirty years as it is. It’s a memoir, notan autobiography. I really always have been an adrenaline junkie and sought outexperiences. And, I’ve toned down everything in it—lowered the volume—but Iknow there are going to be those who think I’ve embellished things or even madethem up. People really do judge other people by their own experiences.You're very frank about your past, how do you view your time as a drug dealerand as a burglar now? You served time for housebreaking, I believe.No—I was never a home creeper! I did over 400 burglaries but theywere all second-degree burglaries—businesses. In Indiana you’re amoron if you burglarize houses (first-degree burglary). At the time, if you gotcaught doing second-degree burglary, there were two possible sentences—2-5or 1-10. Homecreepers drew sentences of ten and a quarter (10-25). And, forwhat? Grabbing some fucked-up TV you couldn’t sell and getting ahernia carrying it out to the car? No thanks! I ended up getting a 2-5.I sold drugs, off and on, for a long time. Mostly heroin and weed,although at the end coke was becoming big and I moved coke as well.As to how I view it, I see it as a mostly fun time. I’dstill be doing it, but don’t like the downside as much as I used to. I’m notan outlaw these days because I had some kind of “coming to Jesus” moment, butonly because I’m too old to jail these days. The food mostly sucks.The low point came when you found yourself homeless, eating out of a dumpster .. .That was just one low point of many! You’re referring to the timeI was homeless in Costa Mesa, California, I presume. I was also homeless inBaltimore and in New Orleans. That’s no big deal, really. Thelowest point was probably in New Orleans when my partner took off with both ourhalves of a coke deal and that represented my rent money. Turned out he lost itgambling. Every day for three days, I approached him at night, sitting out bythe pool at our complex drinking beer and he didn’t have my money. If Icouldn’t pay my rent I’d be out on the street and I knew the only way I’dsurvive would be by holding somebody up and if I got caught I’d endup at The Farm in Angola. Did not want to end up there . . . So, I took astraight edge to him and chased him all around the complex, trying to give hima second smile. I was dead serious and he kind of knew it. One of the girls Iwas screwing at the time came in and broke it up and I gave him two hours toget me my money or we were going to do this all over again, and he did. That tome was probably the low point. Also, there was a group of off-shore riggers inone of the apartments who I owed part of the money to (we’dripped them off in our deal—stepped on the coke a bit too much and got caught at it) and if Ididn’t get caught pulling a robbery or something to survive, they wouldhave exed me. That was kind of tense. Homeless isn’t that big of a deal.There’s better food in most of our Dumpsters than many third world folkswill ever get to enjoy . . .You paint a picture of yourself, back then anyway, as what we'dironically call a 'charmer' over here, but I've read your work and there's somedeeply sensitive writing in there: how do you explain the contradiction? Idon’t see a contradiction at all, Tony. Here’s the deal. I’m smart. Reallysmart. My I.Q. is 163. That means I’m a really good actor and to be a goodactor means you’re blessed with great empathy and insight into others. Thatdoesn’t necessarily mean the same as sympathy. It just means I can put myselfin almost anyone else’s shoes and see instantly their motivations, understandtheir behavior, etc. And, take advantage of it. I can do the same in mywriting. I can write just about any character and be believable, simply becauseI understand that person and know what makes him tick. Most people areridiculously easy to figure out. I’ve always been able to do that. Since I’vemoved so often all my life, I’ve built up very, very few friendships andcreated no “legacies” anywhere, simply because I was never in one place verylong and never developed any relationships. If I run into a person I knew inthe joint, he’ll have an entirely different image of me than the student Itaught at the University of Toledo. Or the two teachers I did a three-way withevery lunch hour in Warsaw, Indiana… They all know a different person.Were you rebelling against your sensitive side because you perceivedit as a weakness, and if so, when did it become a strength?Yes. Like I said earlier, when youmove a lot, you have the opportunity to reinvent yourself each time and Ialways did. I’ve been a lot of different people and will continue to be. Itbecomes a strength simply because you make it a strength. It’s that easy andit’s that simple.Despite reaching your nadir, over and over, the thing that strikes me about youis your lack of bitterness or anger. You do have the Hemingway bullshitdetector installed though, don't you?I think so. Plus, why get pissed? I got myself into whatevertrouble I got into, and I knew the chances I was taking, so why would I get mador bitter? It’s just part of the deal. It’s a cliché, but realcriminals really do believe in the adage, “Don’t do the crime if you can’t dothe time.” I’ve been shot at, shot back, chased by cops, beaten by cops, hadfolks trying to stab me, been in prison, all kinds of stuff, but each time itwas because of a choice I made consciously and knowing the downside. Insurancesalesmen don’t end up in those situations as a rule. So any trouble I’vehad was created by myself. Nobody to blame but me! And, that’sfine. It’s just the cost of doing business as an outlaw. The rewards at thetime far outweighed the downside. When you’re an outlaw, you’reabout as free as anyone can ever be and it feels really, really good! And, mychoices were made at a time when outlaws had honor. That seems to bedisappearing today. I see these punks on TV who’ve just been busted and .. . they’re crying! What kind of sissy cries? That’s a guy whose end I canforesee once he gets in the joint . . .That's the third time you've mentioned insurance salesmen . . . theyreally are the epitome of the shiny-arsed suit, aren't they?Yeah, kinda. I actually sold insurance at one time. And, was good atit. In fact, a guy told me awhile back that they still use a video for trainingthat they had me make when I was a salesman and that was 30-40 years ago.There’s a thing they want you to do and that’s to gather as many referrals asyou can with each policy sale. I was the king of referrals. They wanted you totry to get at least one for each sale and if you could get three that wassuper. I averaged seven, so they asked me to do a video showing my technique.I used the same techniques when I wasa hairstylist. I have three books on building a salon business that still sellwell and send me great royalties each year.There’s just no challenge in sellinginsurance. It’s frickin’ boring. If a person has any intelligence at all, it’sa get-rich-quick shuck. The thing is, money has never ever been my motivator orgoal and never will be. Money’s easy to make if that’s what a person wants. Ijust never did. How many cars can you drive, how many suits can you wear, howmany beds can you sleep in at one time? What’s the point of money? I just don’tget it. It just seems so… average. Shallow. It’s like when I was robbingplaces. I never did it for the money. Didn’t need the money. I did it for thethrill.Publishing is a business you've spoken of in the past, you see through thesmoke and mirrors don't you?I think so. Because publishing is run by people that means it hasall the strengths and all the weaknesses anything else does in which humanbeings are in charge. Unfortunately, today, publishing is powered by the bottomline. It wasn’t always so. What a lot of folks don’t realize is thatpublishing never in history has made a lot of money for the folks who ran it.The average net profit by the ones who made a profit was less than threepercent. A smart investor would run from anything like publishing. Publishinghouses weren’t run to make money in those days, although they tried their bestto do so. If a bright young person wanted to get rich, they didn’t gointo publishing. Publishing in former years was a largely idealized profession.Run by people who valued literature above everything. That’swhat’s changed. Except for a very few, it’s now run by beancounters.Profit goes before everything. And, that’s what’skilling the business, in my opinion. There are no more Bennett Cerfs or JohnMartins . . . at least in the traditional publishing milieu, the so-called Legacy6. These guys are springing up in the indie presses—guys like Jon Bassoff,Allan Guthrie, Eric Campbell, Cort McMeel and Brian Lindenmuth and a fewothers, but very few in traditional publishing. At least not to my knowledge.How do you feel the current business model is holding up?Not too well. Kind of on its last legs. B&N is about to foldand then what? Look at where their prime floor space is going these days. Notto books. To Nooks. To figure out where publishing is going just look at what’s goingon in the brick-and-mortar stores. Fairly accurate forecast.It can be quite a depressing experience going into a book store now,almost as depressing as listening to the people from the Legacy 6 talking aboutthem. In the UK book stores now account for only 30% of paper sales but there'sa lot of evidence to say readers are using them to browse . . . I heard one CEOseriously advance the idea of charging readers to browse. This is the stupiditywe're up against . . .You’re right, Tony, and the stupidity isginormous… There are a lot of clever and smart people but not that many who aretruly intelligent. There’s a big difference. The CEO who proposed this idea isa prime example of the kind of person we used to call, “penny-wise anddollar-ignorant.”Is the future digital?Oh, it seems quite clear that it is. Although, I think it will bea combination of digital and print. They’ll work out a mix thatmakes sense eventually, I think.The 'attraction' of a big publisher seems almost lost on me now butwhen I started out it was the only gig in town; the shift's been seismic butpublishing doesn't seem to have noticed the elephant in the room, or does it?Oh, I think they notice it, but they studiouslyignore it, hoping it will go away. It won’t.Is it harder now to make a living as a writer, or easier?I don’t think it’s ever been easy to make a living wholly as a writer. Very fewwriters—no matter at what place in history—have been able to make aliving just from their writing. Ray Carver, one of our best writers was unableto and this was several decades ago. Except for a handful, the way writers makemoney isn’t from sales of their books, but by appearances and talks andteaching gigs and that kind of thing.I believe you were about to give up on your ambition to get into print when ithappened . . . the advice that changed gears for you was to write every day.I didn’t realize that writing was a job. I approached it the way a lot ofwannabes do—waiting for the muse to descend. I’d get things published, butit was sporadic and not regular. I was just about to throw in the towel when afriend who knew how much writing meant to me had a talk with me. She told me ifI’d just write every single day that in a week I’dfind I couldn’t not write. She asked if I was a jogger—foolish question!—andwhen I said no, she said it was just like jogging. She said if you jog everyday for one week, thereafter you couldn’t not jog. It would feellike missing a meal or worse. I was desperate at the time and I had heard thesame advice over and over and it always went in one ear and out the other. Butthis time, I was desperate. So, I tried it. And she was right. At the end ofthe week, I absolutely couldn’t go a day without writing. And, that’s continued to this day.If my wife died—and I love her more than anything in the world—I’d bedevastated, but I’d still write that day.When I began writing every day, I began getting publishedregularly. Direct correlation. Writing’s a job, just likeplumbing’s a job. You never hear of “plumber’s block” because it doesn’texist any more than writer’s block exists. Plumbers don’t always feel like goingto work, but they do anyway. There are many days when a plumber doesn’tfeel like sending that snake down the drain but they do. And that’s thesame thing writers need to do if they want to be successful on a regular basis.Get over what you “feel like doing.” Just frickin’ do it.What other lessons did you learn about being a writer from the process ofwriting?For myself, not to buy into that common advice to “just get itdown lickety-split and then go back and fix it”. For my writing to work, I haveto make sure it’s as perfect as I can make it before I go on to the next page.For another, never assume you’ve arrived or that you’velearned everything you can about writing. Not possible if you live tenlifetimes and even if you were somehow able to . . . it would soon change. Theonly constant about writing is that it changes.You've written two books on how to write and coached several writers - canwriting be taught?Absolutely. To a certain level. That said, there are some thingsin writing that I don’t believe can be taught. Recently, I read an article by a sportswriter who related an anecdote he had while interviewing Barry Bonds. It wasduring his record year when he hit 73 home runs and was after the occasion ofBond’s 52nd homer of the year. The writer described thesituation which amounted to an impossible feat where Bonds hit a pitch off thehandle of his bat for a home run that no one else in baseball could have withthat particular pitch. He asked Bonds if he’d tell him how he did itand Bonds simply said, “No. I’m not going to waste my time and yours trying to tell you.”Bonds went on to say that there are some things in hitting you can’tteach. That you either “have it” or you don’t, and this was one ofthose “you don’t” instances. He wasn’t being arrogant, but justtruthful. There are some things that can’t be taught and that don’t fitwithin parameters or rules. It amounts to a gift or a superior intellect or atalent only that person has been granted. And, it’s this way in any artform. There are certain things in writing that not everyone can do or master.And those are the folks whose work lives on and on. Does anyone seriously thinkthat Faulkner can teach another writer—no matter how good or evenbrilliant—to write as well as he did? Don’t think so.Have you ever had to advise a student to give up?Sure. Not in those words, probably, but if the work sucks I sayso. And kind of in that language. The thing is, if anyone—includingme—can make a writer quit writing by what we say to them, that personwas never going to be a writer anyway. If it was my words to them that madethem quit, then I think I just saved them a lot of time—I’m pretty sure they wouldhave figured out eventually that they didn’t have what it takes.The thing is, today the culture tries to tell everyone they’re“special” and that they can do anything they set their minds to. Well, lifejust ain’t like that. If everybody’s special, then no one is.If everybody was capable of becoming a good writer, then it doesn’thave much value. But, writing does have value and it’s because not everyone cando it. Often, it’s not simply a lack of talent but a lack of a work ethic and lackof a thick skin. And, I don’t waste much time worrying about those folks. They’reprobably better off if they learn something they’re more suited for, likeplumbing or brain surgery. Or selling insurance. It’s a hard world out thereand having people tell you isn’t doesn’t do anyone any favors.Do you work to an outline when you write or are you a seat of the pants author?Outline, absolutely. But not the kind most people think of.Writing a novel requires a huge devotion of time in one’s life. Why would I wantto waste it? The outline I use is the same one I require my students to use. Itconsists of 15-20 words. None of those Roman numeral Comp I things. Itconsists of five statements. The first is the inciting incident that createsthe protagonist’s story problem. The next three are the three main turning pointsevery novel has, and the fifth statement is the resolution which must contain awin and a loss. That’s it. It gives the writer a road map and it also gives the writerenormous freedom. It also forces the writer to put some thought into the noveland not just start off pedaling. Just like I wouldn’t set out for a long roadtrip to say Adak, Alaska, I wouldn’t set off on the longjourney that writing a novel requires without a map. If I did, I’dprobably end up in San Diego or Nova Scotia instead of my destination.There have been many writers who claim to be “pantsers.”Hemingway, for example. He took great pride in the fact that he didn’toutline. Except . . . he did. The thing is, his outlines were about 100,000words long and he didn’t call them or think of them as outlines, but referred to them as“draft 1, draft 2, draft 3 . . . draft 8.” Same exact thing as an outline, butto my way of thinking a huge waste of time.What about the actual process of compiling a word count - do the words comeeasy?Not sure what you mean by “compiling a word count” Tony. I don’t setmyself limits each day for so many words. I get up at about five am and writeall day until about six in the evening. Seven days a week. Some days I get apage or two and others I might get twenty to thirty or more. As for the wordscoming easy, almost always they do.I just mean getting the words on the page . . . how long does ittake you to write a typical novel?It used to take an average of a year, year and ahalf. Now that I’ve developed an outline system and make each page as perfectas I can before going on to the next, about three-four months.I mentioned the typical novel there but after having just read your latest - TheRapist - I wonder if there is such a thing as a typical Les Edgerton work. TheRapist is a quite exceptional novel.Thank you, Tony—I really appreciate that! I’m also not sure what a“typical” work for me would be. A lot of people today are only familiar with mylast few novels, but I’ve also written a coming-of-age novel, a YA semi-horror novel,several baseball books, business books, etc. My first story collection, Monday’sMeal (which I consider my best work probably) would be considered “literary”and was—the NY Times compared me to Raymond Carver and severaluniversities did studies on it and it got starred review in places like theLibrary Journal, Publisher’s Weekly, etc.A couple of years ago, I did a workshop with Don Maass and we weretalking and having a drink and he knew I was looking for a new agent and askedwhy I didn’t approach him. Because, I said, I know you want your authors tokeep writing the same kind of book and establish a “brand” and I don’tever want to do that. I have too many interests to be limited like that. Donagreed—that was exactly what he and most agents want—itjust makes easier and more profitable marketing and establishing a readership—andwe’re still friends. If I ever wanted to write the same book over andover, I’d look him up in a nanosecond, but I don’t, and my current agent,Chip MacGregor understands this and it’s fine with him. Well, Iknow he’d rather I become a brand and keep writing the same kind of book,but he knows I’m not going to…Where did the idea for The Rapist come from?I had two stories in mind that provided the impetus. The first wasa brilliant short story of Charles Bukowski’s, “The Fiend,” and thesecond was the ending in Richard Brautigan’s novel, A ConfederateGeneral from Big Sur.I feel that Bukowski’s story is the bravestexample of literature I’ve ever read and wanted to see if I could match his guts inwriting it. Brautigan’s ending in his brilliant novel represented the best definition I’veever read for our existence and God and humanity and what’sreally going on in the universe. Just tried to marry them up.Even talking about the book now I have a slight uneasiness about the title andit's not a pretty subject - I'm presuming it was a hard sell . . .Actually, I thought it would be but as it turned out, it wasn’tdifficult at all. I wrote it 26 years ago and didn’t send it out for thatvery reason. I had an advisor, Dr. Francois Camoin, at Vermont College when Iwas getting my MFA, and I showed it to him and he said pretty much what Ithought as well. He said he thought it was a brilliant book but that I’dhave trouble finding a publisher for it, but that if I persevered I would andwhen it came out, it would win literary awards. He also said he’dsuggest I seek a European publisher as he didn’t think the averageAmerican sensibility would “get it.” He thought it fit perfectly the Frenchintellect and I do as well.It is a hard sell to the public because of the title and I knew itwould be going in. However, I’m the poster boy for being against anything politically correct,so if it suffers in sales because of the title, so be it. It’llkeep the kind of mushhead that follows PCism out of the pages of it so that’sgood and worth the tradeoff.You handle the story with a kind of matter-of-factness that's unavoidable -were you consciously employing this as a shock tactic?Nope. It’s just the way I see the world. A psychologist would call me asociopath or psychopath. Actually, that’s pretty much what theprison shrink in Pendleton called me. Probably accurate . . . I just can’t getall worked up about death or crime. It’s just part of life. Ihave pretty much an amoral view of the world. Shit happens . . . Get over it .. .The prose in The Rapist is beautiful - it really set me in mind ofNabokov - rhythms in your prose are obviously important, how hard do you workat those?Not at all. I just . . . write. That sounds arrogant and if so, sobe it. Writing has always come easily to me—I imagine it’sbecause I’ve read voraciously all my life. It’s how we learn to write—byreading—and so the rhythms and all of that are pretty well ingrained in mybrain and subconscious. I really don’t think about much when I’mwriting. Just get it down. I don’t rewrite at all. Justabout every book I’ve written is the way it came out in the first draft. Like Bonds,I can’t explain to anyone how I hit a particular home run nor teach themhow to. I can just do it.And, however others judge my writing, it’s been the same since Ibegan. I have a story in my story collection, Monday’s Meal, that Iwrote when I’d just turned 13, titled “Hard Times.” The only change Imade was the title. Originally, it was “A Mother’s Love” but in the interimbetween when it was written and when it was published I learned a bit moreabout melodrama and therefore toned down the title a bit. Other than that, Isat down and wrote it in one day then and haven’t changed a word sincethen. I think if you read it, you’d think I just wrote itlast week.Up until recently, I wasn’t quite as honest as I amthese days about my writing, and tried to come across as this humble,self-effacing dude. I turned 70 a month ago and something has happened to me. I’mpretty sure I don’t have long to go—have severe COPD among other things—and suddenly it’simportant to me that I say exactly what I think. Like Bonds, I feel I have agift and I no longer want to sugarcoat things and pretend I’msomething I’m not. That pisses folks off, but at this point, so what . . . Notenough writers are pissing people off these days, methinks. It’sbecome a lost art. We’re all too concerned about building those “platforms” andgaining “friends.” I’ve got enough friends and most of them just want to borrow mylawnmower. The friends I cultivate mostly are writers I admire and respect.I also think that too often we want to combine the author and thework in one. As in the work defines the person behind it. I hope that I’mmore than that. At least my wife doesn’t confuse the two . . . Ihave more than one author whose work I absolutely adore and have absolutely nodesire to hang out with them or adopt their politics. And, I’mpretty sure they feel the same about me. And, that’s perfectly all right.What means a lot to me is when you give my work a compliment asyou did above, Tony. In my view, this isn’t praise from someanonymous Amazon reviewer who doesn’t have a clue what they’retalking about, but represents an opinion I value because I value the level ofwork the person delivers to the world.It’s genuine praise, Les . . . but back to you: you mentioned ageingthere, and you’re obviously at time of life where you’re appraising what’s gone- how do you feel about the body of work you’re created and, not to be toomorbid, how it will be viewed and represent you when you’ve shuffled off thismortal coil?I hope it will be seen as worthy. But,who knows? Nobody knows. Richard Brautigan certainly didn’t. Herman Melvillecertainly didn’t. John Kennedy Toole didn’t have a clue. It’s not up to us. Idon’t know who it’s up to!But, I’m angry at this point in life,even though earlier I claimed not to be. I lied. Why am I angry? Because Icould have written so much more. I didn’t know that one loses energy at thistime of life. The kind of energy required to write well. When you’re younger,you don’t realize how physical writing is. I mean, we’re either just picking upa pen or typing on a keyboard. It’s not digging ditches, exactly. And yet, itrequires enormous strength and energy that you don’t realize until you begin tolose it.I’m angry at just about everythingthese days! I wouldn’t have said this even five years ago, but time is runningout and it’s important to me now to be truthful.I’m tired of all the posers. A goodexample is my latest book, THE RAPIST. I had thirty-one of what I consider someof the world’s best writers give it rave blurbs before it was published. Sinceit’s gone up for sale on Amazon, it’s garnered 22 reviews and every single oneis a five-star. And, all are from writers and readers I respect.So what am I angry at? Well, if thismany writers and intelligent readers think it’s a great book, how is it that nopublisher except folks like Jon Bassoff and Brian Lindenmuth wanted to publishit? The same thing applies to my novel, THE BITCH. This is a great novel. I saythat without reservation. I know itis. So how come an agent can’t move it; how come a publisher doesn’t see theworth of it? Who are these peoplerunning publishing? Many writers of worth feel exactly as I do, but no onewants to be the one on record saying so. Well, I don’t give a fuck.And, it’s not just the FIFTY SHADES OFBULLSHIT kinds of books that I’m angry about. Those kinds of culturalphenomenons are always going to be around. It’s the novels in the same genre asI write in that get published that people praise and they’re absolutelymediocre. More and more, I think there are no editors left who actually have abit of acumen and who love books and ideas. In other words, there don’t seem tobe any geniuses left in publishing. Or at least any who have a set of balls.The gatekeepers today are mostlymediocre as a group. That’s why they’re failing. They’re putting out mediocreproducts because they really don’t know what’s good and what isn’t. And,they’re worried more about their 401(k)s than they are in their work. It mustbe absolutely miserable in those folk’s bathrooms when they face their mirrorsin the morning.I’m just… pissed. Time to take mymeds, I guess…The Rapist's protagonist is something of a Humbert Humbert fromNabokov's Lolita; you've claimed the literary novel is dead but this is anunashamed literary novel, is it not?I’mglad you used Nabokov for your example, Tony, as I subscribe to his view onliterature wholeheartedly. He said he didn’t believe in any genreother than “good writing” and “bad writing.” I feel precisely the same.I also understand the comparison to Humbert and others have madethe same observation. Personally, I think Truman compares more closely to theBukowski character Martin in “The Fiend.” Which reminds me—mydream of complete and utter success would be to do the same as Bukowski did andcollaborate with the brilliant artist R. Crumb in a joint work. If anyone outthere is friends with Mr. Crumb . . . The Rapist, I think, would beright up his alley . . . I’d love to send him a copy . . .Market-wise, literary fiction is over. If folks don’tbelieve that, look at the sales figures. Look at the shelf space literaryfiction is given these days in comparison to other books. It’sbeen drastically cut back just in the past seven years and is being cut backeven more.But, it hasn’t. It’s only been reduced if you buy the academic’sdefinition of literary fiction. Their silly definition that literary fiction is“character-based” while genre or “commercial” fiction is “plot-based” ordriven. That’s a wholly bogus definition to begin with. Character and plot areequally important and each depends on the other in equal proportion in anyworthwhile book and the emphasis of one over the other doesn’tdetermine if it’s literary or commercial, except in the minds of the definer. Plot—causalplot--is simply what reveals and defines character. It’s how the character reactsand acts toward the obstacles encountered in the story that deliver a characterand a character arc. If there is no or if there is little plot, then it’s not“literary” at all. In fact, it’s largely unreadable. Those kinds of books are simply a writerregurgitating his or her largely bullshit thoughts as he contemplates hisboring-ass navel that no one except writers of like ilk care anything about,and they only care about it as it reflects the stuff they’retyping and hope some other mindless literary type publishes.Writers like Joe Lansdale, Allan Guthrie, Ray Banks, James LeeBurke, Tom Franklin, Neil Smith, Richard Godwin, Paul D. Brazill—yourself,for God’s sakes!--and a thousand other writers are writing gorgeousfiction that in any intelligent view of what is literary and what is not, isjust that—literary fiction, provided the definition simply means the bestwriting. The academics don’t consider it such, but who cares what they think except for afew, under-read college freshmen who haven’t yet learned to think forthemselves and make their own value judgments?Part of the problem is that by and large, the great unwashed nolonger have much faith in their own acumen in deciding what’sgood and what isn’t. Therefore, they rely on pompous pedants in telling them what’s“good.” Another part of the problem is that the big awards—theBooker, the National Book Award, the Pulitzer, the Nobel, the Governor-General’sAward and the like—are almost always given to books by academics, particularlyleft-leaning academics (that’s an oxymoron, isn’t it?), and books that are actually entertaining are almost alwaysnever on the lists.Even the lesser awards are usually determined by what awriter-friend of mine called “clubitis.”Those things are virtually all about politics these days and havevery little to do with storytelling. Well, I’d rather be known as agood storyteller than just about anything else.Well, now that I’ve pissed just about everybody off… I’m off to open a bottle ofJack… Sorry to be so arrogant and self-absorbed, but since this is maybe one ofmy last chances to go on the record and say what I really think, so be it.Thank you again for this opportunity, Tony. I appreciate it.Well, that was it, folks. Hope to see some of you in Texas!Blue skies,Les"},
{"title": "Tom Pitts' new novel HUSTLE is superb! Snubnose Press does it again!", "date": "Saturday, April 19, 2014", "text": "Hi folks,I'm extremely proud to let you know that my friend Tom Pitts asked me to write the foreward to his newest novel, HUSTLE, and I can't begin to tell you how proud that made me. This book is groundbreaking in its content and approach and to use a term that is overused but apt in this case--absolutely brilliant.Here's the foreword as it appears in the book:FOREWORD FOR TOM PITTS’ “HUSTLER”Tom Pitts’ Hustleris, quite simply, one of the very best novels I’ve read in a long, long time.There’s just no other way to describe it. Years from now, I’m convinced it willbe viewed in the same light as the early work of Charles Bukowski—as aground-breaking classic. To be honest, there is no one to compare Pitts to withthis book. It will be the novel that will be considered as the first—and best—of,for want of a better term—“hustler” noir.Perhaps the best comparison—not in the writing, but in therevealing of an underworld lifestyle—would be to Robert Beck’s seminal classic,Iceberg Slim. The difference is,Pitts doesn’t attempt to portray his protagonist as heroic as Beck does, butmore along the lines of Jean Genet’s character Divine in his brilliant Our Lady of the Flowers. But, while bothof these writers and both of these books use the settings of the underworld ofsex-for-pay and/or aberrant sex-for-pleasure, there is a significant differencein Hustler, in that Pitts’protagonist, Donny, isn’t portrayed as a man who sees himself as a maverick ora rebel, raging against the system and defiantly proud of his rebellion, butsimply as a human being to whom drugs have reduced to an intolerable lifestylewhich he is unable to escape, although the entire book is about his struggle todo so. Both Iceberg Slim and Divine embrace their lifestyles, but Donny doesnot. That is the difference and why, even though there are similarities insettings and lifestyles, Donny is more akin to Bukowski’s Martin Blanchard thanDivine or Slim. And yet, he isn’t like Blanchard either. The thing is, he’s anentirely different character than just about anyone in literature. Donny sharessimilarities with other literary creations, but in the end, he is a whole newcreation. And, because of that, Hustleris a whole new category of noir.And, while Donny doesn’t see himself as heroic, of course heis. He’s a survivor and that is the best proof of heroism that exists. He’sproactive on his own behalf to escape the hell that he’s in and against moreterrible odds than Hercules or Atlas ever faced and what makes him extremelylikeable is that he doesn’t see himself as heroic in the least.Hustler is goingto be seen by its critics as both remarkable and abhorrent. Often both by thesame critic. It’s going to offend some crime writers I suspect, becausecompared to their own work, which of course they will in their own minds,they’re going to realize that their efforts—compared to Pitts’—are more along thelines of The Hardy Boys Have Adventuresin Sugar Creek. In other words, there are many pretenders and poserswriting crime and noir novels, who have little or no experience with theelement they are writing about. Pitts knows his milieu and better than anyoneI’ve ever read. His novel rings loud and clear with hard, honest truth. Heknows these guys and he doesn’t judge. Readers looking for the comfort ofstereotypes are bound to be disappointed. Like Bukowski’s Martin Blanchard, heallows his characters to have souls and, indeed, insists on it.Pitts told me that there was some pressure on him to editsome of the rougher parts to make it more palatable for readers. In his words, “They'retrying to have me soften it a little, I'm trying to hold fast.” Please do, Tom!If any of this gets “softened” it will only prove that as a culture, we have,indeed, become so PC’d we’ve lost our souls. To “soften” this book would meanliterature has lost to moronic politics. And we’ll all be the poorer for that.END OF FOREWORD The novel is available in an ebook format as well as in paperback. It's just one cool-looking book and my preference is the paperback version.Tom and I had become friends online a couple of years ago and then I got to meet him at Bouchercon in Albany this last year and we knocked back a few brews together and instantly bonded. He told me a bit about this book then and I knew right away I had to read it. It's based on his own true life experiences and those are always the best books. You just get the kind of verisimilitude other writers just can't come close to in cases like this.It's also by the Snubnose Press folks and these people know their crime and noir fiction. Brian Lindenmuth is simply a class act and his books all rock. I'm a bit prejudiced I suppose--they chose to publish a small collection of my short stories a couple of years ago--Gumbo Ya-Ya.Anyway, I hope you glom onto a copy. You'll see that I haven't steered you wrong at all. It's a book that's going to make a bunch of those \"Best of\" lists and it deserves to.Blue skies,Les"},
{"title": "YOU GOTTA READ THIS...", "date": "Monday, April 14, 2014", "text": "Hi folks,I'd like to introduce you to a book and a writer I'm very excited about. MatthewLouis is the founding editor of Gutter Books and the anarchic pulpfiction zine, Out of the Gutter. He lives in Portland, Oregon.  And is one helluva writer!Here's my review of his novel, THE WRONG MAN: It’s kindof rare to come across a novel as perfectly structured as THE WRONG MAN is. Itstarts out exactly as it should—a guy trying to live a righteous life andbefriend an old pal is suddenly involved by that friend in a race to stay aliveand protect himself and his family and before he knows it or can do anythingabout it, he’s got his back to the wall, in the middle of a shooting war, withthe bullets whizzing closer and closer, the bodies falling, and the scent ofdeath everywhere. I read as a writer and believe me, an entire class could beprofitably taught using just this novel. The fictive dream is establishedimmediately and there’s no departure point where the reader can leave. MatthewLouis has crafted one of the most interesting, best-paced and plotted novelsI’ve read in a long, long time, and I just hope he keeps cranking ‘em out asfast as he can.If youlike your novels to be as dark as the far side of the moon, move like a runawaytrain with the engineer out from a heart attack, while the hapless passengerleft aboard the only one who can keep it from plunging down the mountainside,and who begins to grow into the heroic figure he will become, this is your kindof book. This one’s a winner in every way. Gonna be in my top five of the yearfor sure. I’ll be saying to everyone I talk to: “You gotta read this.”You gottaread this.Check it out.Blue skies,Les"},
{"title": "Raves for Rob Boley's first novel, THAT RISEN SNOW", "date": "Saturday, April 5, 2014", "text": "Hi folks,I take great pride in today's post. I want to tell you about a good friend of mine's first published novel, Rob Boley's THAT RISEN SNOW. I've kind of gone along the journey a bit with Rob and feel a \"brotherly\" pride in what he has created.I met Rob a couple of years ago when I was asked to be a presenter at the Antioch Writer's Workshop in Yellow Springs, Ohio. This was one of the most pleasurable weekends I've ever spent at such an event and Rob was one of the reasons why. He was part of the writer's group I was privileged to work with (we dubbed ourselves \"The Best Writer's Group\" and we were...). Every single member of our group was not only a uber-talented writer but the nicest group of people I think I've ever got to hang out with.Rob and I became instant best friends. We hung out just about every hour except when we were sleeping. Our favorite place was \"The Gulch\" my kind of bar, along with our other best friend, Amanda Winfield.Well, each member of our talented group read to the assembled folks at Antioch and Rob's reading tore the roof off the place with the wild reaction it garnered. Just plain laugh-out-loud writing. I saw it immediately as something that should be published and I introduced him to one of my publishers who jumped on it with both feet. At last count, Aaron Patterson of StoneGate Ink is planning on publishing a series of Rob's books of at least eight, I believe. This is the first one and they're all a riot of laughs.Rob and I have continued our friendship. He's been over to spend weekends with me and my wife Mary and son Mike a couple of times--the last time he also brought his fantastic daughter Annabella. And, she truly is fantastic. I've never seen a warmer and more loving relationship than these two have.Anyway, without further ado, I want to introduce Rob and his first novel and urge everyone to run right over to Amazon and glom onto an ebook copy. It will also be out in paperback in a couple of months.For another treat, check out Rob on his blog with his amazing daughter! At http://www.robboley.com/blog/Tell 'em I sentcha! THAT RISEN SNOW by Rob E. Boley Book One of the Scary Tales: A Killer Serial DESCRIPTION: The zombie sequel to Snow White begins where the classic fairy tale ends, withthe Prince’s kiss waking Snow from her cursed slumber. Snow wakes up, but shedoesn’t wake up right. Now a deranged zombie, Snow infects both the Prince and the seven dwarfs’leader. That leaves the young dwarf Grouchy, who is secretly in love with Snow,to find a cure for her malicious curse. So begins an epic journey that pits thelovesick Grouchy against dwarf-hating human soldiers, Snow’s ever-growingzombie horde, and his own bad temper. But when Grouchy and his motley crew of survivors escape Snow’s clutches andseek refuge in a nearby human village, he soon finds that her affliction hasspread faster and further then he ever could have imagined. Snow is hell-benton spreading her horrid curse across the land, and it’s up to Grouchy to stopher before it’s too late. For fans of horror, dark comedy, horror comedy, dark fantasy, zombies, andmashups such as Pride and Prejudice and Zombies; Abraham Lincoln, VampireHunter; Sense and Sensibility and Seamonsters; Little Women and Werewolves;Queen Victoria: Demon Hunter; Henry VIII: Wolfman; Jane Slayre. REVIEWS: “Part delicious dream, part nightmare, That Risen Snow is an aberrant fairytalethat is just as much a horror story. Boley has a knack for dark comedy andwitty prose, and he blends it with a nearly-hardboiled voice uncharacteristicof (and therefore pleasantly unique in) dark fantasy fiction. It’s a storyyou’ll want to tear ass through but will equally want to slow down for, so youcan savor the prose.” —Brady Allen, author of Back Roads & Frontal Lobes “In 1912, the Brothers Grimm published an old German fairy tale they titledSnow White. Little did they know that a guy named Rob Boley would come along ahundred years later to reveal the ‘true’ and adult story of Ms. White, or‘Snow’ as she was known in real life… No one could have possibly foreseen whatwould become of Snow in the hands of a diabolical, maniacal imagination likeBoley’s… Such a nice boy… with such a fevered mind. Read this with the lightson and a baseball bat or shotgun handy… you’re gonna be glad you did. This is aSnow White you ain’t gonna find in the middle school library… Get it, read it,and try to keep the screaming down.” —Les Edgerton, author of Hooked, Just Like That, and The Bitch “That Risen Snow and That Wicked Apple make a deliciously diabolical tale—partWalking Dead, part turned-on-its-ear fairy tale. Rob Boley strikes the perfectbalance of depth, drama, and dark humor to keep readers devouring the pages andleave them hungering for more.” —Linda Gerber, author of the Death by Bikini MysteriesThat's it, folks! Blue skies,Les"},
{"title": "A GOOD DAY!", "date": "Wednesday, April 2, 2014", "text": "Hi folks,I just ran across a couple ofblogposts that I wanted to share with you guys. The first is from author LisaFernow, who made my day when she talked about my newest novel, THE GENUINE,IMITATION, PLASTIC KIDNAPPING, a black comedy crime caper coming out in Augustfrom Down&Out Books. This book is my personal favorite and I’ve beenwriting a sequel to it for some time. KIDNAPPING began as a short storypublished in The South Carolina Review and then I wrote a novel based on it andthen a screenplay. The screenplay was named a Finalist in both the Writer’sGuild and Best of Austin competitions. The novel has a German publisher inPulpmaster, and the owner of that press, Frank Nowatzke, liked it so much, hetook it to Berlinale, the European film festival that is a sister festival tothe Frankfort Book Festival. Frank received great responses to it he told me, butall see it as a movie that would have to be filmed in the U.S. and not Europe.Hoping it attracts some attention here when it comes out!Anyway, here’s what Lisa had tosay about it:The Genuine Imitation PlasticKidnappingPosted by: LisaFernow In: Accomplices, Book Stores andWriters I Love, Books 31 Mar 2014 Comments:1 http://lisafernow.com/the-genuine-imitation-plastic-kidnapping-2/I happenedto be reading Publishers Marketplace, the industry rag that lets you know whatbooks are being sold to publishers by various agents, and I came across a bookthat made me laugh so hard I nearly wet my pants.Here isthe description: Les Edgerton’s THE GENUINE IMITATION PLASTIC KIDNAPPING, inwhich a couple of two-bit hustlers come up with the bright idea of kidnapping acrime boss’ fake hand, and hold it ransom for some serious money, to EricCampbell at Down and Out Books, by Chip MacGregor at MacGregor Literary.I just hadto write to Les.

If you like someone’s work, write to them and tell them so. Itreally makes their day.  And sometimes it makes yours, back.Thanks,Lisa! Any time a description of one of my books causes someone to laugh so hardshe nearly wets her pants, my day has been made. (And, PW got part of this wrong--it's not a \"fake\" hand but his real meathook that gets whacked off.)And then, I came across ablog I visit regularly, Col’s Criminal Library, and saw a really cool shout-outof my novel, THE BITCH.COL'S CRIMINAL LIBRARY Tuesday, 1 April 2014MARCH2014 READING LIST AND PICK OF THE MONTH March provided a decent monthof reading, without me finding that book that was truly stand out andmemorable. I had a slow start to the month with the Hunsicker book, which has made medecide, as much as possible to avoid long books at the start of the workingweek as I just get bogged down. Better to save them for a holiday or a weekendstart when I can eat a big chunk up and make some progress. My enjoyment of The Contractorsprobably suffered as a result, though a mark of 3 appears generous.      Book of the month! 9 books were read in the month, which is 1 shy of my goal of10 to achieve 120 for the year. I have yet to hit that magical figure in anymonth in 2014 - hopefully I will catch up later in the year.All 9 books were authors new to me, (18 from 26 so far in 2014 - I've decidedto count Agatha Christie as a new author last month),4 of the books were debut novels and I would happily read more from all debutauthors - Kirschman,Veste, Harvkey and McCrary.2 were by females (making 5 from 26 for the year - 19% go me! Double lastyear's % but could still do better)5 were Net Galley books (God, I really went overboard on there didn't I?), 2were received from the author, 1 from the publisher and 1 book was actuallybought, though it subsequently transpired it wasn't even a whole book, just aportion of it.7 were US authors - no surprise there, 1 from Australia, 1 from the UK.In the course of the month my reading took me to Sydney, Liverpool, Cincinatti,Texas, New York, Missouri and Indiana, with some flying visits to Arizona andMexico as well as a couple of unknown locations!Progress on my challenges - no Vintage Reads, no Scottish reads, no Espionagereads, no TBR Mountain reads, 1 for my Down Under challenge and a few statesfilled on my USA challenge (6 from 51, so I'm making some progress there). Most of my reads were very good, just a bit short of great. Tough to pick abook of the month, but as I read it cover to cover in about 3 hours flat it hasto be EllenKirschman's Burying Ben. The good news is, she's writing a second DotMeyerhoff book!      Runner-up! A close second would be Les Edgerton and The Bitch.The full list of March reads is as follows:Harry Hunsicker - TheContractors (3)Les Edgerton - The Bitch (4)Mike Resnick - Dogin the Manger (4)Ellen Kirschman - BuryingBen (4)Mike McCrary - GettingUgly (4)B. Selkie (aka Peter Robb) - FinalCut (aka No Sweat) (aka 1/3rd of Pig's Blood and Other Fluids) (3)Mike Harvkey - Inthe Course of Human Events (4)Luca Veste - DeadGone (4)Dorothy Uhnak - Codesof Betrayal (4)---------------------------------------------April aims - hit 10 for the month, keep up the female count, chip away at someof my challenges, clear the Net Galley burden from my shoulders - free is notalways a good thing!Thanks, Col!A good day!Blue skies,Les"},
{"title": "Fun time with Libby Hellman", "date": "Tuesday, April 1, 2014", "text": "Hi folks,Sorry to have been gone so long, but my son Mike and I had a week's vacation in Cave Creek, AZ as guests of my best friend, Tom Rough and his family, wife Lisa and daughter Nicola. It was wonderful! Mike and I and Tom got to go to a Giants' game where we beat the A's and I got to meet up with some of my class members at Federal Pizza.Joe and Maegan, me, Linda, Suzanna and Kristen--all uber-talented writers and fantastic friends. Well, Joe isn't a writer but he takes the load off Maegan so she can write and he's just one of the nicest guys I know.When I got back home, I needed to plunge right into the new session of my online class and that kept me busy until yesterday. I owed a friend a chapter for a new crime book he's asked a bunch of us to contribute to and that leads us up to... today!Where, when I opened my email this morning, I received the following post from the brilliant writer, Lilly Hellman. Her words warmed the ol' cockles of my heart and I thought I'd share them with you.It’s SteveSanders’ Fault; Les Edgerton’s tooMarch 21, 2014 I was at a Christmas party two years ago at which WGN  news anchorSteve Sanders was also a guest. We started to chat, and when he found out I wasa crime writer he told me he had a story for me. Those words are like catnipfor a kitten — I’m a sucker for a good story. So I followed Steve into a cornerwhere he proceeded to tell me about a Ku Klux Klansman in Alabama who was inprison for lynching a black man. A few years into the Klansman’s sentence, ayoung black man was wrongly convicted for raping a white woman. No one reallybelieved the boy was guilty, but the jury was all white (it was the earlySixties), and the kid didn’t have a chance. The young man apparently was assigned to the same cell as the Klansman,and over time, the two became great friends, confounding the expectations ofalmost everyone in the penitentiary.  I don’thow much of that is, or was true, but it stayed with me. A few months later, Ihad an opportunity to submit a story to the Fiction River Crime Anthology edited by thewonderful Kristine Rusch and Dean Wesley Smith, and I decided to tackle thatstory. However, aside from a couple of visits to Cook County jail and a woman’sminimum  prison in Racine, Wisconsin, I am woefully unfamiliar with prisonprocedures. So I put out a request on Facebook for someone who might point mein the right direction. One name kept coming back; Les Edgerton, a terrificcrime writer and himself a one-time inmate at Indiana’s Pendleton penitentiary,which had the honor of being called out by LBJ in the Sixties as one of theworst prisons in the country.I got intouch with Les, read his book JUST LIKE THAT, which recounts his experiences atPendleton (and which I highly recommend.)  After that, we emailed andspoke on the phone several times. Les’s patience and generosity was endless,and I am in his debt. There is no way this story could have been writtenwithout his help.Of courseI embellished, changed, and added some noir elements to the story—I was in mydark period. The result is No Good Deed which amazingly, did make itinto the anthology released this week.I am delightedto share space with acclaimed authors Doug Allyn, Brendan DuBois, my goodfriend Julie Hyzy,Steve Hockensmith,and more, and I urge you to check out the anthology. Meanwhile, here are the first few grafs ofthe No Good Deed.GertieMorton’s baby kicked so much in the womb that she knew the kid was going to bea troublemaker. Luther didn’t disappoint. Born in 1943, the colicky babyscreamed so much that Gertie thanked the Lord their closest neighbor lived halfa mile away. Once the colic was over, teething began, and Gertie gave Lutherliberal amounts of whiskey that her husband cooked up in their still.  Shesometimes wondered if that was the root of Luther’s problems.Luthergrew into a rowdy boy and even rowdier teen: stealing bikes, then cars, thenwhatever he could get his hands on.  Which wasn’t much—they lived in adirt-poor area of Southern Indiana. Luther wasn’t much of a student either,until a sheriff’s deputy caught him smoking and drinking whiskey at the poolhall. Luther seemed to clean up after that, and Gertie was surprised when hecame home with a decent report card in twelfth grade. She proudly proclaimed toeveryone she knew how he was one of the best students in the school.Shelearned the truth a few months later when Luther told her that his high schoolEnglish teacher was a member of the Ku Klux Klan and had recruited him into thegroup. Gertie remembered the problems the Klan had caused in Indiana over theyears, and while she didn’t exactly disagree with them, she didn’t think itwould end well.It didn’t.A few weeks after Luther’s twenty-first birthday, he was convicted of takingpart in a lynching. Sentenced from fifteen to life, Luther was sent to thestate prison at Pendleton near Indianapolis. Enjoy! Libby HellmanThanks, Libby.Blue skies,Les"},

Tell him I sentcha!Book Review HOOKED: Write FictionThat Grabs Readers at Page One and Never Lets Them GoBy Les EdgertonWriter’s Digest Books, 2007Hooked is the book about beginnings.Books about fiction-writing tend to fall into one of threecategories:  A-Z     books, which address a wide spectrum of fiction-writing issuesQuasi-biographical     books, which are as much about the author as they are about writingNarrow-focus     books, which take an in-depth look at a specific aspect of fiction-writing  Hooked, by LesEdgerton, focuses on one aspect of fiction-writing: beginnings.  In general, readers should expect anarrow-focus book to:Adequately     address its topic of focus, compiling and reorganizing the body of existing     informationDebunk     misinformation and out-of-date practices about the topicOffer     new ideas and insight about the topicLes Edgerton has accomplished all of these in Hooked. Why a whole book about beginnings?  As explained by Edgerton, “The simple truthis, if your beginning doesn’t do the job it needs to, the rest of the storymost likely won’t be read by the agent or editor or publisher you submit itto.”Edgerton addresses misinformation and out-of-date practices froma historical perspective and as they relate to literary fiction.  Whenever an author sheds new light on asubject, there is a risk that someone will be offended: no exception here.  Writers, of any genre, in the habit ofbeginning stories with hefty servings of backstory or description get anearful.  Those who believe that studying the classics is the key tounderstanding fiction may be turned off by Edgerton’s take on beginnings: “. .. many of the great books from the past aren’t practical structure models fortoday’s market, particularly in the way some of those books begin.”  And, “Beginnings have changed more than anyother part of story structure.”Likewise, fans of literary fiction may take exception tosome of Edgerton’s observations.  “Bookscanhas revealed the decline of what is usually referred to as literaryfiction.  This category of fiction may bedying because it has stuck with the story structure model of yesteryear muchmore so than any other category.”Hooked is organizedinto eleven chapters:Story     structure and sceneOpening     scenesInciting     incident, initial surface problem, story-worthy problemSetup     and backstoryCombining     inciting incident, story-worthy problem, initial surface problem, setup,     and backstoryIntroducing     charactersForeshadowing,     language, and settingOpening     linesRed     flags Opening     scene length and transitionsView     from the agent’s and editor’s chairThe last chapter is structured as questions and answers fromagents and publishers.  For example, fromagent Jodie Rhodes: “ . . . the more modest the writer, the better thewriting.  That’s because good writersknow how much they still have to learn.”Hooked is a mustfor the bookshelf of serious students of fiction.SUMMARIZATION: A fairly malignedfiction-writing modeBy Mike KlaassenShould you always \"show\"rather than \"tell?\" Summarizationis the fiction-writing mode whereby story events are recapped. In summary modeevents are told rather than shown. Action mode shows an event in detail as it happens, summarization tells about it. The old writing axiom \"Show.Don't tell.\" implies that summarization is inferior writing, to bediscouraged. This is unfortunate because telling, in the form of summarization,has a vital role. Any event may be portrayed either inthe action mode or in summarization. Consider the following gunfight in actionmode:As the sun reached its zenith, Cisco strode onto the dust-filled streetand faced Black Bart. Without warning, Bart reached for his pistol. Cisco divedto the right as Bart fired. Cisco rolled in the dirt and drew his Peacemaker.He fanned his hand across the Colt’s hammer in rapid succession, sending threeslugs into Bart’s chest. The same event may be summarized as: At noon, Cisco faced Black Bart and gunned him down inthe street. Summary mode has many applications.It may be used to: (1) report an event that doesn't warrant the detailed,as-it-happens treatment of the action mode, (2) shift from one time or locationto another, (3) setup a writing passage by \"catching up\" the readeron what has happened since the previous scene, sequel, chapter, or section or(4) vary rhythm, pace, tone, or texture.[i]REPORTING EVENTSSummary mode is appropriate forreporting events that don't warrant detailed, real-time presentation. Asfiction writers we make many decisions. We choose which events to report andwhich to leave out. We choose which events to report in detail and which tosummarize. For example, depending upon the objectives of the author, the summary of the gunfight described abovemay be appropriate. Readers may need to know that event occurred but don't needto know the details. Telling lets thereader speed past less important action. If fiction were a video player, actionwould be accessed with the \"Play\" button, and summarization would bethe \"Fast Forward\" button, where events are skimmed over. Summarization may be particularlyappropriate when there is repetition of events.[ii]For example, if Black Bart was one of five gunfights Cisco had that day,showing each of these events in action mode could become tedious for thereader. SHIFTING TIME OR LOCATIONSummarization provides an opportunityto telescope time and shift locations. Rather than showing all the details inan uninteresting journey, the writer might summarize it. For example: Over the next three hours as the storm continued, they followed thewinding path around and over one dark hill after another. Like a time machine fitted with aglobal-positioning device, summarization can transport the character acrosstime and space.SETTING UP A NEW PASSAGE OR VIEWPOINT CHARACTERSummarization may be used to set up anew scene, sequel, chapter, or section—even a change in a viewpoint character.This may be accomplished at the beginning of the new passage simply by namingthe new viewpoint character and describing what he is doing, thinking, orfeeling. For example: Fortney reached the top of the hill and stopped. Before him, as far as hecould see, stretched rolling, grass-covered hills. VARYING RHYTHM, PACE, TONE, OR TEXTURESummarization and action, even whenused to describe the same event, have a different pace, rhythm, tone, andtexture (Just think of the gunfight described above). The decision to use oneversus the other becomes a tool for manipulating the story. For example,imagine a medieval battle with knights engaged in a series of sword fights. Thewriter might decide to describe the first fight in action mode, summarize thenext three (Over the next hour Arthur dispatched three more dark knights.), andthen show the climatic fight in gory detail. As with each of the other tenfiction-writing modes, summarization has both advantages and disadvantages.Action involves the reader and is intimate and immediate, but too much actioncan fatigue the reader. Summarization distances the reader and lacks immediacy.Summarization offers one distinct advantage over the action mode, and that isbrevity.[iii] Summarization deserves respect as afiction-writing mode. Without summarization, fiction could be tedious anddisjointed. For any particular passage of fiction, the challenge is to showwhen appropriate and to tell when appropriate.

Here they are, unexpurgated (which means I didn’t mess with ‘em).Well, I didn’t personally purgate them, but the person who put them on the ‘Gnathas taken the liberty of casting them in present-day English for easierinterpretation by today’s public school students.Dear WilliamShakespeare,I was recently onholiday, and happened to attend a performance of a play at the new theater overat Stratford (the Globe, which has the best darn popcorn I think I’ve evertasted! The beer, however... skunky!). A play I understand you’d written, titled RichardIII. While I think you’ll agree that you’ll never be a Christopher Marloweor even a Thomas Nash, I have to confess that I was somewhat impressed by theperformance (enough that I could overlook the obvious historical fallacies towhich I ascribe the fault to lay at “artistic license.”). I think you have somepotential. I do feel it would benefit you to employ a better editor than theone you currently use. For instance, that line, “Now is the winter of ourdiscontent,” is more than a bit ponderous and clumsy. I can doubtless help youwith those kinds of things among the other services I can provide.If you’re not yetaware of whom I am (please indulge me a polite laugh as I’m sure you do unless you’vebeen living in Manchester or Newcastle!), I am Leonard Cojone, literary agent extraordinaire.And, it is in this role that I am contacting you, sir.

ShakespeareDear William,Well! This posesa problem for me! You say you’re writing a comedy? But, the other plays I’veseen or am aware of from you have all been dramas. Why would you do this toyourself? To your career? Are you not aware of the value of building a brand?You seen to have secured a bit of a foothold with your dramas (even with thehistorical errors, not to mention some elements that I would have changed,i.e., the situation where there is far too little violence—only Richard himselfdies on stage and I think you know as well as I that our gentle English folksmuch enjoy far more bloodshed upon the boards than you’ve allowed), and as one whohas his finger on the pulse of the public, to venture into another form seemsto me to court professional suicide.Besides, when onesays he writes “comedy,” I confess I have to take that with the proverbialgrain of salt, sir. It is one thing to claim to have a humorous bent of mind,but my experience has been that those who claim that particular skill, almostalways are just not funny, except to relatives and other prejudiced parties.This presentssomewhat of an obstacle for me. I think you may have somewhat of a future indrama and tragedies; I am not so sure that switching to comedies wouldn’t bethe kiss of death for your career. I should like to dissuade you from puttingpen to humor, sir. If not, perhaps I am not the agent for your future success.Please advise.Sincerely,L. Cojones, Esq.Dear Mr.Cojones,Please don’tmisunderstand. I plan not to abandon dramatic works nor tragedies; I simplypossess a wider range of interests and although it is possible I cannot writehumor—I do have valued friends who have convinced me that I can. My friend,Francis Bacon, has told me more than once when we are in our cups down atthe tavern, that he has often “spurted ale through his nose” at some of thewitticisms I uttered. Many times, he has smiled and told me he was going to “steal thatline” at some pithy saying I threw out. Might I not send you a copy of the playI am currently putting to parchment, with the working title, “A Midsummer Night’sDream?”Yr Humble Svt,Wm. ShakespeareDear William,May I call youBill? Bill, I believe you are making a tragic turn in your career. Not only arecomedies not selling well these days, this appears from the title to have supernaturalelements. Well, sir—I am here to report that supernatural plays are over. OVER!Their day has long passed. No theater in England will present a play withsupernatural bits to it. Are you mad, Bill? Are you taking meals at the hatters and perhaps accidentally ingested some mercury in your bitters?Oh, Bill, I wishI could make you fully aware of the professional suicide I see you are makingwith these foolish notions of writing comedy! You seem to have a bit of a knackat creating drama, but I see nothing but disaster and a sad ending for youshould you pursue this folly of mounting a comedic play! The thing is, Billy,through much scientific research and polling, we have determined the only wayto create and sustain a profitable career in the theater is by creating a brandfor the author. A brand, Bill! That means your name becomes synonymous with asingle element. In your case, that brand is tragedy.If you cannot seethe wisdom of this advice and persist in following your foolish and ill-advisedtack of persisting with this comedy idiocy, then I have no recourse but to endour communication and withdraw my offer of representation to you. I see no profit in continuing our discussion.This is a sad dayfor me, sir. I honestly thought I saw a bit of talent in you. Alas, I was wrongit seems.Regards,LeonardDear Lenny,Go fucketh thyself.

It'll bury you!,February 27, 2014 By Rob E. Boley - See all my reviewsAmazon Verified Purchase(What's this?) This review is from: The Bitch (Paperback) From the first page, this book grabbed hold of me andwouldn't let go. The protagonist Jake describes his situation as an avalanche,and that's an apt metaphor. This book comes at you fast and hard. It'll buryyou!The pacing is spot on, and Edgerton always keeps you guessing. He drops justenough hints at Jake's prison back story to make you curious to find out more.And he keeps the tension of the core plot cranked way high, making you anxiousto see what'll happen next. What's more, he makes you care about Jake. At theheart of this story is Jake's marriage, which comes off as a very realrelationship, full of bursts of passion, smoldering resentments, tendermoments, and enduring hope.This is a brilliant example of how genre fiction (in this case, thriller) canbe every bit as poignant and expertly-crafted as \"literary fiction.\"Buy it, read it, and be prepared to lose sleep over it.Thanks, Rob!

{"title": "NEW FIVE-STAR REVIEW OF THE BITCH", "date": "Tuesday, February 18, 2014", "text": "Hi folks,Just got another 5-star review of THE BITCH on Amazon! Making this old geezer a happy camper!5.0 out of 5 stars         Between an Expensive Rock and a Hard Place, February 18, 2014              By Wag The Fox (Canada)  - See all my reviews        This review is from: The Bitch (Kindle Edition)      Previously published a couple years ago, New Pulp Press has breathed new life into Les Edgerton's The Bitch with a new release this winter. I had heard about Edgerton last year through the Booked.Podcast, raving his novel, The Rapist, and didn't hesitate when I got the chance to read this one. While the title is a bit deceptive to those unaccustomed to prison slang, the hard-edged storytelling is there in full glory and made it hard to put this book down.Jake Bishop used to be a heck of a burglar when he was younger, but he still managed to get sent to prison twice. With the threat of winding up there a third time hanging over his head, he resolved to go straight. He got married, got a good job as a hairdresser, even setting himself up to start his own business pretty soon with the money he has saved, which is great because he has a baby on the way, too. And then his old cellmate shows up in town and all his best laid plains crumble like rotten snow.The Bitch is impeccably paced and the tension rises from mildly uncomfortable at Jake's first contact with Walker to downright excruciating when the secrets Jake keeps from Paris pile up like a house of cards. Some of that cringe-inducing tension comes from the anticipation of what Jake's bad choices, one after another, are likely to lead to, but there's also the unanticipated repercussions that throw Jake's already careening life into a brand-new tailspin.Jake is a likable guy, relatable even, but there are moments where it's difficult to root for the guy. Even with detestable characters like Walker Joy and the scumbag jeweler blackmailing Jake into one more heist, the tug-of-war going on with Jake's sense of right and wrong gets more than a little compromised, especially when it becomes harder and harder to hide the truth from his wife. As much as there is intrigue into whether he can pull off the job as smoothly as he's planned it, there's even more intrigue over just how low down he's willing to go to do what he convinces himself is best for his wife and kid.It's early in the year still, but The Bitch is a novel I will not be at all surprised to see show up on my fave five list of 2014 novels at the end of the year. If you enjoy Joe R. Lansdale's stories, or those of Scott Phillips or Anthony Neil Smith or others who deal with noir fiction, you'll be doing yourself a favor by reading something by Les Edgerton.  To be compared to my heroes like Lansdale, Smith, and Phillips just warms the cockles of my heart. At least, I think it does... if I was just sure what cockles were...Blue skies,LesMe, being a happy camper..."},

{"title": "New review of THE BITCH by Mark Matthews", "date": "Sunday, February 16, 2014", "text": "The Bitch~ Les EdgertonFebruary 16, 2014 by MarathonMarkTitle: The Bitch   Author: Les EdgertonGenre: Crime NoirFormat: KindleSource: NetgalleyReviewed by: Mark MatthewsRating: 5 out of 5 Description: Ex-con Jake Bishop is several years past his second stint in prison and hascompletely reformed. He’s married, expecting a child, and preparing to open hisown hair salon. But then an old cellmate re-enters his life begging for afavor: to help him with a burglary. Forced by his code of ethics to perform thecrime, Jake’s once idyllic life quickly plunges into an abyss. Jake soonrealizes that there is only one way out of this purgatory . . . and it mayrupture his soul beyond repair.Review:  First off, I should note that the title “The Bitch” is inreference to the main character’s fear of being labeled a “Ha-Bitch-ual”criminal.  More on that later.Ex-contrying to fly straight and be a family man gets called back into the lifestyle.Sure, you may  have seen this done before: But this author does it so wellthat it never gets trite. Feels like true crime, with a language that is neverforced.Thetension escalated beautifully. Unpredictable, yet always getting higher, likethe tick, tick, ticking noise you hear the roller coaster make as you climbthat first hill. You weren’t sure what twist it was going to take, only thatthe author showed so much skill you would trust it would be somewhereinteresting. You get to know the main character so well, that it’s hard not totake him out of the book and back home with you.As far asthe title referring to the legal implications of being labeled a “Ha-Bitch-ual”criminal, I don’t think the author would mind you thinking otherwise. In someways, the main character lets his past make him his bitch, so to speak, bytrying to live by the code of his old world and be happy in the new. Likewise,his wife, tries a ‘cross-over’ with similar results. There is moral ambiguityhere and a value system that the main character has that you don’t have toadmire, but you will certainly feel it along the way. As the main character,Jake, goes rifling through what to do next, you want to scream out to him,“Dude, did you realize you just ((spoiler alert)) how are you going to shoot amove through this one?”I have tobelieve that crime fiction speaks to the voyeur in all of us. The part who wantto know how criminals live and what they think. And the best crime fictionmakes us realize they are one of us, or we are one of them. We find ourselvesidentifying with the character at some parts, wishing they had more of a moral compassat other parts. We may get disgusted at their choices, other times we may justwish they’d be more slick and get away with it. All of these things and morecrossed my mind as I committed crimes alongside Jake and Walker.Read thisfor the story, for the plot, for the characters, and for the concise as aconcrete slab prose. If you are lucky like me, you can read it at your parentscottage, isolated, surrounded by snow, which was exactly the setting thecharacters found themselves in as they tried to cover the tracks of theirmisdeeds. I was able to go home and live happily ever after with my family. Thecharacters of this book may have not been so lucky.Thanks, Mark--tickled pink that you enjoyed the read!Blue skies,Les"},
{"title": "CHARACTER DESCRIPTIONS--FROM DAVID MAMET", "date": "Wednesday, February 12, 2014", "text": "Hi folks,As some of you know, I’vegotten into the habit of providing a literary quote of the day in Facebook. Ihave personal experience from my own writing life that “proves” the quote Iprovided today, at least for me. First, let me provide that quote:Quote of the day: (Ondescribing characters.)“Bruno Bettelheim, in The Uses of Enchantment, writes that thefairy tale (and, similarly, the Drama) has the capacity to calm, to incite, toassuage, finally, to affect, becausewe listen to it nonjudgmentally—we identify subconsciously(non critically) with the protagonist.“We are allowed to do this,he tells us, because the protagonist and, indeed, the situations are uncharacterized aside from their most essentialelements.When we are told, forexample, that a Handsome Prince went into a wood, we realize that we are that Handsome Prince. As soon asthe prince is characterized, ‘A Handsome Blond Prince with a twinkle in hiseye, and just the hint of a mustache on his upper lip…’ and if we lack thatcolor hair, twinkle, and so on, we say, ‘What an interesting prince. Of course,he is unlike anyone I know…’ and webegin to listen to the story as a criticrather than as a participant.”David Mamet from his book Writing in RestaurantsYears ago, in my days ofcutting hair, I talked to most of my clients about my work. That was a bigmistake—I later discovered that when I talked about the work, especially thecurrent work—that I’d expended the energy of actually writing it that nightwhen I went home and faced my computer.But, in those days I stillhadn’t learned that lesson. What was profitable from those conversations wasthat I learned something from my readers. Most had read my work, particularly Monday’s Meal, my first collection ofshort stories. We’d talk about them and I’d answer the usual questions—how didyou come up with that idea? did that happen in real life? how come there are alot of characters who have their hands or fingers cut off? And then, one day, Inoticed in our conversations, very often the person would describe one of thecharacters in the stories. That’s odd,I remember thinking. I couldn’t ever remember providing character descriptions.It wasn’t because of something someone had told me not to do—I’d experiencedlittle or no writing instruction of advice in those days and wrote purely froman instinctual stance. I went back to see if I had, inadvertently, provideddescriptions. I hadn’t.So then, I began asking theperson I was chatting with if he or she could describe the character in thestory we were talking about. Sure, they said, almost to a person, and proceededto deliver a very detailed, sometimes exhaustivedescription of the person. And, I began to notice that in these very complexdescriptions always there would be a characteristic that belonged to the persontelling me the description.“And where,” I said, “didyou get this description from?” “Why, it was in the story,” they’d say. “No, itwasn’t,” I said. I’d open a copy, turn to the story, and ask them to point outwhere their description came from. They’d skim through it, a puzzled look ontheir faces, and finally, say, “Well, I was sure I read it.” And then, we’dlaugh and go on to other topics.I think the best way tolearn to write well is to read lots and lots and lots. Something I’ve done allof my life. One of the things I’d always thought boring in a novel was when theauthor described their characters. Especially when they overloaded the detailsof those descriptions. I knew that my brain switched off at those passages andI’d almost always skip those parts and go ahead. And, usually those kinds ofstories were fairly boring to me. At the time, I couldn’t articulate why thatwas so, I just knew it was.And, like Harry Crews (whosaid it first and these days it’s inaccurately attributed to Elmore Leonard,who included it in his book on writing and had taken it from Crews) I wasalways acutely aware of those parts I tended to skip when reading and did myutmost to not provide those parts in my own writing.And, then, a few years ago,I happened upon David Mamet’s book, Writingin Restaurants, and when I read the quoted passage above, had one of those Eureka! Moments.I didn’t change anything. Ididn’t pay closer attention to avoiding character descriptions—that was alreadyfinely-honed in me to not do so, but it is always great when you encounter abona fide writing “authority” that confirms what you’ve been doing is spot onthe money. Kind of validates what you’re doing.How about you? How do youfeel about character descriptions? Are you like me or are you the opposite? Areyou one who really enjoys the author laying out exactly what the protagonistlooks like? If you are, can you say honestly, if upon encountering such adescription you begin reading as a critic or remain identifying subconsciouslywith the protagonist? Or, does it even matter to your own personal experience?I’d really like to know!Blue skies,LesAnd, if you haven't read Mamet's book, I highly, highly recommend it to all writers--it's an amazing book."},
{"title": "Review of Dana King's GRIND JOINT", "date": "Monday, February 10, 2014", "text": "Hi folks,I read tons and tons ofbooks. Last count, I’m averaging 3 ½ novels a week. That’s a lot. The trulygreat ones I try to provide reviews for. At last count, I’m about 15 booksbehind. Here’s one I read several weeks ago and just re-read it. For the thirdtime. That kind of tells you how I liked it, I think. But, if that wasn’t a bigenough clue, here are some other thoughts I had about it:GRIND JOINT by Dana KingOne of the best novels I’veread this year. Period. I’d read three of King’s novels previous to this oneand waited and waited for it to become available on Kindle and finally I wentahead and bought the paperback copy, simply because I couldn’t wait any longer.(Note: get the other three—they’re as good as this one is.)I’m glad I did. Not so muchbecause I finally got to read it—that’s a for-sure plus—but because I’ve nowgot a physical copy. That’s important because there are dozens and dozens oftechniques I want to steal for my own writing and to pass on to my writingstudents and this just makes it easier to bookmark and make the theft and getout before I’m caught.In some of the reviews I’dread of GRIND JOINT, it was often mentioned that King was bringing back to lifethe subgenre of mafia crime books. I guess I’m out of touch—I never realized ithad died. Well, if it had, this definitely gave the genre new life. And, if ithasn’t, this is pumping steroids into it. Make room at the table, Mario Puzo…Reviews very often aren’tabout the book itself so much as they are about the reviewer. Some see that asa negative. Not this reviewer. Sure, the plot is complex and sound and tight. Sure, thecharacters are entirely interesting and plausible. Sure, the world it containsis realistic and well-drawn. All \"reviewery\" things. But, I read differently than someone who’s not awriter and is just looking for a great way to kill some time. GRIND JOINT doesthat for sure, but what impressed me more than anything is that I consciouslylooked for weak places—places I could set it down easily and go and dosomething else. Well, very few books are capable to achieving that kind of deep hypnosis upon me… but this one did. It’s simply Grade A, Top Quality, SterlingSilver. 24-Carat Can’t-Put-It-Down.Trust me on this. Better: Don’t trust me. Grab a copy and see if I’m not right.I couldn’t find a single page anywhere in it that didn’t grab and hold myinterest. Not a single page. This guy's a writer's writer.If you like an insider’slook at the criminal world and are intrigued at stories that reveal how people “inthe life” think and what drives their actions, this is the book for you. If youenjoy stories that draw back the curtain on the seamy side of town as well ason the good side of the tracks (which aren't much different), this is the book for you. If you get youradrenaline going when you encounter a protagonist you want to hang with and have beers with,this is the book for you.If you prefer novels about vampiresand fifty ways to make your eyeballs bleed and your trouser worm get exercise,and characters that are 6’8”, Hollywood-blond, can bench-press Buicks, go 24hours without sleep, food or water, and can defeat 9,000 ninjas in warehouses(why are these guys always in warehouses?), and only need a toothbrush and amicro chip inside them that draws bad guys to their vicinity like six-year-oldsto chicken nuggets to make their lives complete... then this probably isn’t thebook for you.One reviewer said shefinished reading this book “on a gurney in an emergency room with crying kids,a car accident victim and a loud drunk” keeping her company, and she “barelynoticed them,” then, yeah, this is your kind of book.It’s exactly like that.Blue skies,Les"},
{"title": "GAMBLING AND THE SUPER BOWL...", "date": "Sunday, February 2, 2014", "text": "Hi folks,Well, it’s here—SUPER BOWLSUNDAY!I’m pulling for PeytonManning.Today brings up thememories of the only time I got to go to a Super Bowl. I went to Super BowlVIII, the Minnesota Vikings vs the Miami Dolphins.For a hundred bucks.That’s the truth. Thatincluded airfare from South Bend, Indiana to Houston, Texas and back. Itincluded the game itself, for a seat on the 45-yard line. It included drinks and meals onthe plane there and back. It included a visit to an all-you-can-eat-and-drinkseafood restaurant after the game.For $100.Here’s the story. It’smostly about gambling so those who aren’t interested in that activity, youmight want to go on to something else. For those who like gambling tales,stick around.At the time, I was a year or two out of the joint and was cuttinghair at Michael and Friends Hair Salon in South Bend. Directly across thestreet from the famed Linebacker Inn and a block from the Notre Dame campus.Not only was I cutting hair in the best hair salon in the state, I was heavilyinvolved in gambling. At the time, I was averaging $2,000 weekly in wagers. Thatdoesn’t mean I was winning or losing that amount—that was just the averagebeing bet each week. And, I won, fairly often. Averaged a profit of around$5-600 a week. And, I was the piker in the shop. Michael and a couple of hisfriends averaged a lot more. It’s a myth that all gamblers end up losing. Justnot true. Gamblers usually win. Weekend betters usually end up losing. Weekendbetters are those amateurs who bet on the teams they follow, that they’re fansof. I was taught to gamble by some of the best gamblers who ever lived. MichaelMurray, the owner of Michael’s and several of his friends, including one guywho owned a small chain of supermarkets and sold them and ended up making hisentire living the rest of his life by gambling. A much better living that hissupermarkets provided previously and that was a handsome living. But, he did alot better when he devoted all of his time to it.(There is a side storyhere. Michael and another friend found this guy (I think I remember his name as Bob David but could be wrong) in his apartment one Sunday after he hadn’tshowed up at his regular haunts for a few days. He’d been executed,gangland-style, with the typical two .22s behind his ear. Whoever did itwas never found, but it was pretty clear it was over a debt he was slow-walkingto the local Mafia. And, yes, the Mafia was alive and well in South Bend thosedays. Might still be as far as I know, but I’m not in that life any more so don’tknow.)Michael had a couple-threetelephones in the back room, all devoted to gambling. They were connected tobookies in different parts of the country. The “secret” to making moneyconsistently in those days was accomplished by “middling.” Alas, amateurbetters—those aforementioned “weekend betters” ended up ruining middles for uspros. I haven’t gambled much since.For those who may beunfamiliar with the term “middles,” let me explain. At the time, Vegas came outwith the spread on college and pro football on Mondays. There’s some backgroundinfo non-gamblers need to know at this point. The point spread has almostnothing to do with the game itself. There used to be a single guy in Vegas whoset the spreads for the entire country. Then (as now, I believe), the Mafiacontrolled gambling nationwide. It’s just gone more underground, but it’s stillthe way it was. Just looks more corporate these days…Anyway, this guy wasn’tinterested in providing a number that reflected who he thought was going to winor lose. That had little or nothing to do with the spread he posted. Contraryto what some seem to think, bookies don’t make their money by inducing bettersto lose. Gambling is a business. What the mob or local bookies want is toinduce 50% of betters to bet each way. If there are 100 gamblers, they want themoney to go half on each team. Professional gambling is conducted with hardbusiness principles. Bookies make money on the 10% the losers pay on their bets—thevigorish or “vig” or \"juice.\" And, it works. If you can run a business with analmost-guaranteed 10% net profit, you’ve got a winner. Week in, week out,bookies earn 10% on their handle. It’s as sure a thing as there is.What the guy who set theline did was set a line that he felt (through experience) would attract equalnumbers of betters to each side of the contest.Well, it would be easy ifthe initial line did just that, but it doesn’t. Betters usually end upoverloading one side or the other. Usually, by simply being from differentparts of the country. And, that’s expected. For example, let’s say Alabama isplaying Notre Dame. A lot more money is going to be going to be placed onAlabama in Huntsville than it is in South Bend which will go ND’s way. For a localbookie, the magic number was $10,000. Whenever the handle went to 10K for oneteam over the other, the local bookie “adjusted” the spread half a point toattract betters to the other side to even it up. (Keep in mind throughout thisthat the vast amount of money bet is by those “weekend” or “amateur” betters.Who almost always bet with their hearts and not their heads.) If it stayslopsided, the local bookie will usually “lay off” his excess with anotherbookie who has the same problem with his bets. For instance, the South Bendbookie will lay off with his counterpart in Alabama. This traffic is conductedthrough Vegas who directs bookies to each other. If the handle becomesoverloaded nationally, the national spread is adjusted, plus the layoff is madedirectly with Vegas who is basically the “mother ship.”The professional gamblerknows and understands all of this. The amateur doesn’t.And this is what the phonesin the back room were for. Michael had connections with bookies in the South,in the East, and in the West. Even though the initial line was set by Vegas,fairly quickly, local bookies had already adjusted their lines. And, wouldcontinue to do so up until game time. This means that in the example of ND vs ‘Bama,the line in South Bend might have the Irish favored by three points close togame time, while in Alabama, the line might be ten favoring the Crimson Tide.If a better had access to both bookies, he could create a “middle.”He could bet say $1,000 onNotre Dame “with” the points, i.e. a grand on the Irish on a bet where theywere favored by three points (with an Alabama bookie). He could then turnaround and within a minute or two, create a like bet, but this time taking Bama…and ten points.What this means is that thebetter can win one and lose the other in the worst-case scenario. Which means he’s reduced his exposure toa five percent loss and not a ten percent. In gambling, that’s huge. But… andthis is a big but… he can win both ways if both bets fall within the spreadeach way. I.E. a “middle.” And, they pay off a lot. The bigger the differencein spreads becomes the better chance for a middle to hit.This was all right as longas only the pros were aware of how it worked and the weekend betters didn’t.However, more and more pros would let their buddies in on it and like all goodthings, it came to an end. Vegas didn’t have a problem with the pros making alittle like this. Pros were usually careful not to abuse the situation, butamateurs are an entirely different matter. They effectively killed the goldengoose. This is the reason they don't issue the spreads now until the weekend.And, that’s when I quitgambling.Michael taught me anothervaluable trick. Vegas knows the heavy hitters well—the ND’s, the Alabama’s, theOhio State’s, the USC’s, the LSU’s. They can set the spread in their sleep withthese programs,  just over years ofexperience and knowing how the money will go. But, there are bunches of otherteams they know little about but put out a spread anyway. That’s where I reallymade my money. I picked 4-5 colleges that were little known. Schools likeSlippery Rock University. I subscribed to their college papers, to the townpapers, to every single source of information I could get my hands on. And,those were the teams I bet on or against. The lines Vegas set on these kinds ofteams had nothing to do with reality. It was just a number they felt wouldattract equal numbers of betters each way. What I would do was consult my researchon the team and the team they were playing and write down what I felt was arealistic number they would win or lose by. I’d do that on each Sunday. Then,on Monday when the spread came out, I’d look for anomalies between the Vegas spreadand what I thought would happen, based on my research and knowledge of the teamand their opponent. If, for instance, I thought Slippery Rock would beat Toledoby 12 points and the Vegas line had them favored by three, I’d jump all overthat. Had a winning percentage of almost 75%. It just comes from preparation andunderstanding how spreads are created.And, that’s your gamblinglesson for today. There are some other tricks and strategms of the trade, but I’mholding them close to the vest in case I decide to start gambling again… Plus, I'm considering writing a gambling novel and don't want all the inside info to become common knowledge.Which (finally, eh?!) leadsus to the Super Bowl.The entire season thatyear, I had made a ton of money off Fran Tarkenton and the Purple People Eatersand the Minnesota Vikings. Tarkenton could do no wrong that year. Didn’t paymuch attention to the Dolphins who, the year before had gone undefeated, butthe general feeling was that they’d taken advantage of a soft schedule.A week before the game,Michael told me that our neighbor across the street, Stan Pietzak, owner of theLinebacker Inn and a serious gambler and our friend, was taking a group to theSuper Bowl and that I could get in on it. Stan had purchased a plane some timebefore this and formed a “travel club” and it was the club he’d gotten ticketsfor it for. I’d previously joined as they often had what they called “MysteryFlights” where you and your wife or date would jump in the plane with 40 othersand the plane would take off, parts unknown. Well, the pilot knew where he wasgoing but the passengers didn’t. One time, I remember we ended up in Buffaloand were taken to a really classy restaurant. Another time, we ended up inWindor, Ontario (this was in the days when you didn’t need a frickin’ passportto go into frickin’ Canada, forcrissakes!).Since I was already amember, I just called Stan and told him I wanted to go. The fee? A hundredbucks. For everything. Flight, meals, seats at the Super Bowl, et al. Remember,this was in the days before Pete Rozelle made it into the Second Coming.Most of the members of Stan’stravel club were bookies or heavy gamblers. His friends.We got to the South Bendairport that ayem and climbed aboard. Stan hired his waitresses from the bar tobe our “stewardesses.” During the flight, they delivered box lunches to us, saton our laps, partied down with the rest of us. It definitely wasn’t DeltaAirlines!During the flight, I satnext to a guy named Buddy who was one of our chief bookies. His uncle was theGodfather of South Bend. We got into a heated argument about who was better—Dolphinsor Vikings—and I ended up betting the Vikes against his Dolphins, straight up,no points—for $2500.We got to Houston and thegame had been changed at the last minute from the Astrodome to the RiceUniversity football field. Pipes had burst or something at the Astrodome.Well, we get to the game—seatson the 45-yard line—and I sat just in front of Jimmy Wynn, the home-run sluggerfor the Houston Astros they called “The Toy Cannon” on account of he had suchprodigious power and was a little guy. He was short, but heavily muscled. And,a really nice guy. We chatted all throughout the game. Next to me was anotherSouth Bend bookie and before the game started we started arguing just as Buddyand I had and I ended up betting another $2500 with him… me taking the Vikes, natch…Well, that turned out to bethe longest game I’ve ever sat through. And, while I can’t prove it, lookedlike the “most-fixed” game in football history. All year long, Tarkenton hadtorn apart defenses with his rocket arm and pin-point passes. Not in this game. It seemed like everysingle play there were multiple receivers wide open, nobody around them for ten yards,yet Tarkenton elected to always throw it to the guy downfield who was beingtriple-teamed. We were screaming at him the whole game. I mean, it wasblatantly clear that he was ignoring wide-open receivers, play after play. Idon’t have a clue what it looked like on TV, but in person if the fix wasn’ton, it was a primer in how to run one.Game over… and I’m out fivebig ones. I’d had a bunch of good weeks up until then, but it still hurtbig-time. Pretty much wiped out everything I’d won the month before…After the game, we allpiled into a bus and they took us to the San Jacinto Inn, a huge seafood placedirectly across from the San Jacinto Monument. (Side note: When I got back home,a week later I was talking to my mother and told her where we’d eaten and sherevealed to me that that restaurant had been founded by mygreat-great-grandmother. Wish I’d known that while we were there!). It was ahuge room with these big picnic tables that were groaning with shrimp and crabsand all kinds of seafood. There were these big oil drums full of ice and beereverywhere and it was all you could eat and drink. Again, included in the $100ticket.Afterwards, they took usback to the airport where we boarded Stan’s plane and flew back to South Bend.On that leg of the flight, once again there was all you could eat and drink andcavorting with Stan’s waitresses.Except for the gamblingloss, a really cool trip. I miss Stan. He was one colorful character. One time, the IRS padlocked the bar's door for tax debts... and Stan just cut a hole in the side of the building and people could enter that way.Sometime I’ll tell youabout attending the 1987 Final Four game where my wife Mary and I watched KeithSmart sink the winning shot for my alma mater, I.U. against Syracuse in thelast second at the Super Dome. We went to that game for even cheaper than theSuper Bowl. Paid ten bucks apiece for our tickets…Hope you enjoy the SuperBowl! I’ve got my money on Peyton Manning and hope that doesn’t screw it up forhim…Blue skies,Les"},

Take the cannoli. \"It always seems impossible until it's done.\" Nelson Mandela Right now Shakedown (Kirkus & Booklist*starred* reviews) available on Kindle for $.99 ...Thursday, January 30, 2014BookReviews … Movie Review … the Sleaze Column(s) … the Stoner Bowl … HappyAnniversary, Principessa! Amici:Books … The Bitch,by Les Edgerton … there’s a basic noir formula that goes something like this:introduce a dark character (sometimes with a touch of light in his soul), thenput him in a vice and keep squeezing; put him in the wrong place at the wrongtime doing the wrong thing and then make the wrong people show up in the wrongplace at the wrong time … and so on. How the formula is delivered is what makesit work or not. Anthony Neil Smith mentioned chops in hisforward to Les Edgerton’s The Bitch … I’ve also seen words likeverisimilitude and gravitas attributed to Edgerton’s works … and it’s all true… not to mention the crafty hooks he leaves at the ends of chapters that demandyou turn the page just that much faster (rather than put the book down and waituntil you have some free time later in the day). Edgerton gets you to make timefor this novel about a twice fallen con struggling to maintain a peacefulcivilian life through hard work and commitment to family. And the vice he getssqueezed by is his past—2 bits in the joint where he made enemies and friendsalike, so when a former cellmate he owes his life to shows up, you know itcan’t be good. So does Jake know it can’t be good … Walker (Jake’s formercellmate) needs Jake’s help … reciprocity can be an MF’er in the criminal world… owing anybody never works out well … so when Jake is forced into performingone last criminal act (or is it the last one?) … things unroll so fast andfurious, each turn of the page comes with great anticipation and fear. And talkabout people showing up at the wrong place at the wrong time … No spoilers here. Buy the book and findout the rest. The author himself has paid the price of incarceration and comeout shining.

{"title": "BAD... NO, TERRIBLE NEWS...", "date": "Wednesday, January 29, 2014", "text": "Hi folks,I’m afraid I have some badnews. Let me take that back. I have some terriblenews. Bad news is when your wife saysshe’s leaving you for the water softener man. This is far worse than that. Thisis on the level of news that she’s leaving you for the guy who lives down bythe river in his refrigerator carton…Okay. Ready? Sitting down?Here goes…It’s official. Once again,I didn’t win the Pulitzer Prize for Literature. How many times must I taste thebitter truth that time is running out? Once a year, I guess, until I run out…And, what beat me out thisyear? The Orphan Master's Son by AdamJohnson. You’re kidding, right? Here’s the description:An exquisitely crafted novel that carries the reader on anadventuresome journey into the depths of totalitarian North Korea and into themost intimate spaces of the human heart.It’s abook set in North Korea? Who the hellnominated this? Dennis Rodman? Who even reads books set in North Korea? EvenNorth Koreans don’t read books set in North Korea. Well, that’s not exactlytheir fault—they aren’t allowed to by that sweet little cherub, Dear Leader.Speaking of cherubs, I woke up this morning with a sweet little cherub in myskivvies… Or was that a chub? Whatever. They both look the same.I suspectit won because of the author’s name. He’s named after two American presidents. Jingoismat its worst.I shouldhave known I wouldn’t win once again after last year when they couldn’t find asingle book to give the award to. There were only five million books publishedlast year (even taking out the four million self-published autobiographies thatreally suck swamp water, that still leaves a million books, give or take a fewhundred thousand.).How canyou not give one single book the award? Even the year the Miss Americacontestants were all dogs, they still gave the award to someone. Bert Parks.That was the year there weren’t any brunettes from Mississippi and Georgia.But, hey—they still awarded it to somebody.I’ve hadit. I’m taking serious action. I’ve just composed a strongly-worded letter toall the judges of next year’s Pulitzer committee, notifying them that I’mofficially withdrawing any and all of my books from future consideration. I’m sendingit via Overnight Delivery, Certified Mail. That means it won’t arrive in their mailboxes until August, 2015 on a rainy day when the mailman can't play golf and has to tend his route, but I have no control over that. They’ll at least beaware of my sentiments.And, as ithappens, I’m outlining a new novel that fits all of their crappy requirements.It’s set in (some obscure country which I haven’t decided yet, but one withlots of consonants and only one vowel) and it’s about the Mayor of Cracktown--or as it's dubbed in the tome, \"Crktwn\").It’s about this guy who lives in a village with the Entering and Leaving signson the same pole, and in this little tarpaper shack with a fridge on the porch and with a bunch of farm animals ofvarious religious persuasions living inside with him. He has no money (always arequirement of these kinds of books and which immediately makes him a genius). Hehas a major fight with the garda (This is a hint as to what country it's set in...) whohave discovered he’s far exceeded the legal quota of farm animals allowed in adomicile, one of which he claims shouldn’t count as it’s a very pretty Merinoewe to whom he’s pledged his troth. He’s not sure what a “troth” is but it’s ina lot of Dickens’ books he read as a kid so he knows it’s important to pledgehis. Especially to a noble farm animal like his beautiful Sndrznsky who has stolen his heart.In thisbook, I devote a lot of pages to his internalizing, which seems to be high onthe list of stuff these Pulitzer folks look for. There’s one really dazzlingscene where he ponders how clichés came about and fantasizes about their origins.Like that delightful phrase “blind alley” (which, I, for one can never hear toomany times.). He ruminates and ponders and rumes some more and comes to theconclusion that it originally denoted a place where German shepherdscongregated en masse, waiting to be hired by the seeing-challenged (PC term forblind people) and veterans with PTSD. This riveting scene takes up 26 pages,which is guaranteed to manipulate them even more than a teenaged boy’s chubduring bathroom time. And, in much the same way.There's another powerful scene in which he stares at clouds and figures out their shapes and how they affect his life. Don't start this scene if it's late at night and it's important to be at work early the next day! One of the indoor farm animals will be a dog. His onlyfunction is to be in the book so I can use his picture on the cover and on theIntergnat. You and I know it’s just a frickin’ mutt, but people on theIntergnat have assigned a mystical aura to dogs and cats. You know, those critters that eat their own poop, coughup furballs and lick themselves all day long. We know that mostly they’re glorifieddoor mats, but people get all weepy about them and giggly and attribute themwith the same wisdom they do old Indian guys crying over some trash on Highway10. THEY SELL BOOKS. And influencePulitzer judges… Taking a break from his butt-licking and getting ready for his photo-op...The protagonist will be a creepy loner with really bad breath, who, in reallife, people would take a wide berth around when they see him with his signbegging for Ripple outside Target, but instantly make into a wise man simplybecause there’s a whole book centered around him and we see he thinks aboutpithy stuff like blind alleys. And clouds that look like jism... If hewas so frickin’ wise why ain’t he a plumber’s assistant or a governor orsomething?My protagonist is also an orphan. And a master (of Sndrznsky). Andthe son of a dog (not the one on the cover). This makes it a sure winner.Yes, Icould easily win next year, which makes my protest even more meaningful. I knowwhat it takes after studying these things for hours days weeks. It’simportant to know who’s handing out the hardware. The judges are elderly folkswho braid the hair in their noses (the women) and meet at Golden Corral todiscuss the nominated books. The men on the committee treat the books nominatedthe same way they do the fine wines they own. They don’t open them. That woulddestroy their value and besides, who has to actually read the nominated book?They can learn all they want to from the glorious Intergnat. The men also havelush bushes in their noses, but they use them differently than the women (mostof the women…). They weave them cleverly around their noggins kind of like thecomb-overs aging sportscasters do. Along with a few well-placed strands fromthe ear hairs.This isthe real secret as to why my book never gets nominated. I labored for yearsthinking they actually read the books. Don’t laugh—I bet you know at least oneperson in your own circle who thought the same thing. So maybe you knew, but are you willing to saythat all of your friends wear those helmets and rode the short bus to h.s. andtook all A.P. classes? So—cut me a break here.The trick to getting on these judges’ radar is toeffectively utilize the Intergnat. Most of us writers have been sold a bill ofgoods about what the ‘Gnat does. Social media doesn’t sell books. It doesn’tsell squat. It doesn’t sell books—it sells social media. No one cares aboutyour stupid book on social media. They pretend to… so you’ll buy theirbook. Writers who can’t sell books have one problem—they write crappy books.Yakking about them all day long on social media sells three books total. That’sit. And that’s to trolls who are burning to write one-star reviews on it. Whensocial media sells books, let me know. Otherwise, lay down by your dish with yourbutt-licking dog.But, Pulitzer Prize judges do look at the Intergnat. Allday long. It’s why they don’t have time to actually read the books themselves.Too busy Facebooking each other or Twittering about “that wonderful book aboutNorth Korea Dennis Rodman likes so well.” Think about this. 1. Dennis Rodman'spicture with Dear Leader was on the “Gnat” one million, three hundred thousandand sixty-nine times last year. 2.  Dennis Rodman was the guest host, subbing for Chris Matthews 36 times, talking about stuff tingling down his leg. 3. A book set in North Korea won the Pulitzer.Make the connection, dummy! This ain’t nuclear physics!So, if I weren’t about to withdraw from consideration, here’swhat I’d do. Get me a babe to do my networking for me. As Lo Hai Qu soeloquently pointed out—“Blogbitches rule, blogdicks drool.” Okay. I acceptthat. If I was going to remain involved in the competition, I’d be on my kneesbeseeching my pal, Anonymous 9 (Blogbitch Supreme) if she’d please help thislowly Blogdick (me) out.Anonymous 9 - Blog... Babe... But I won’t.You can relax, 9. I’m out of all this. I just hope you nice folks “twit” and “face”my new book all over the Intergnat. I have but one goal for next year. That allthe UPS drivers who deliver my books are forced to buy trusses.(I hope you know this was all in fun, folks.Although, if I have to say this, it takes all the force away…) I do love theIntergnat and I truly do love the folks on here. True that. And they do sellbooks. Books on how to use the Intergnat to sell books…)As John Goodman once (wisely) said, “Seeya in the funny papers.”Blue skies,LesP.S. Attention MacArthur Grant peeps. I'm still available for this, but time's running out. Please take note..."},

This review is from: The Bitch (Kindle Edition) I've watched a lot of cop shows, so I know The Bitch iswhat criminals call laws that say three strikes and you're out -- gonzo is theman convicted for the third felony to rot in prison for life. Something thievesand other non-violent cons think very hard about when they leave prison for thesecond time. (I figure violent guys can't help themselves.) In Les Edgerton'sTHE BITCH, which sports an ex-con and a nice guy for an author -- I call himButch -- the authenticity and likability shine through protagonist Jake Bishop,a two-time loser. If I call this tale classic, true or traditional Noir, youknow -- basically -- what's going happen to our new friend Jake. It's almost aspoiler. But the way Edgerton spins The Bitch out for us, shows us the workingsof Jake's mind and soul as he travels down that frightening road of baddecisions, we know this wonderfully told, neatly written story is really aboutus -- every man and every woman. We know exactly what Jake Bishop's world feelslike because it's a world we all think we know: Everything is fixed against us,no matter how hard we try. Careful. This book will touch you.Thanks, Brandon, Carson and Jack! I’m just plain stoked thatyou liked these books. I appreciate the time you spent on writing a review—it meansa lot.Blue skies,Les"},

By “true noir,” I mean theclassic story of a person who is not necessarily bad, but can be nudged in thatdirection, either through opportunity, or forced by events. This person makesdecisions that go sour, though the options at the time ranged from bad toworse; the die was cast with the first unfortunate choice. The stories areengrossing because readers can’t help but wonder what they would do in the samesituation, and are relieved at the end because they didn’t have to do it.  Today we have plenty of neo-noir and “thrillers.” Too muchneo-noir consists of bad people reveling in their own depravity. Bad thingshappen, and they’re often okay with it. The “protagonist” may, or may not, faceconsequences. Readers rarely empathize, because the reader would never be incircumstances remotely similar; too many unconscionable decisions were made inthe backstory. The stories are often more schadenfreude than noir. Modern thrillers often have protagonists with noirpotential, but the opportunity is lost when the protagonist invariably choosesthe option most likely to make the situation worse at every opportunity.Readers wonder what they would do for a while, until—if you’re like me—theystart to root against the protagonist because he/she’s too dumb to be allowedto reproduce.  The Bitch is true noir.  Jake is a two-time loser. Another felony conviction willmark him a habitual criminal, which carries an automatic life sentence. (The“bitch” referred to in the title.) He learned to cut hair in prison and foundhe had a talent for it. He’s gone straight, married a woman who accepts hispast and loves him for his present and future, and whose family has done thesame. Jake and Paris have saved enough money to open their own shop in a fewweeks; Paris is pregnant.  Enter Walker Joy, Jake’s old cellmate. Walker saved Jake’slife once in the joint, and he’s calling in the marker. Walker has not gonestraight, lost some diamonds, and needs the help of master burglar Jake to makethings right. Jake is torn, and doesn’t have as many options as he at firstthinks.  What happens next put me in mind of the classic A SimplePlan. Decisions are forced on Jake that continue to escalate the situation.He chooses as best he can from limited options, all foul. Every decision isframed by the fact he can never cut his losses and turn himself in; The Bitchlooms. Only his conscience acts as a governor on his behavior; the law’sposition is set in stone, no matter what else he does.  Les Edgerton has written a story that is effective onmultiple levels. Time and again the reader will see a new crisis and realizealmost simultaneously with Jake what has to be done, cringing as it happens,not knowing what else could be done and still avoid The Bitch, which will costhim Paris and his child forever.  As if the engrossing personal situation isn’t enough,Edgerton weaves social commentary into the story without ever preaching aboutit. Habitual Offender laws have become commonplace, society’s way of dealingwith people who just don’t seem to get the message. I had no problem withthem—when properly applied—until I read The Bitch and realized atwo-time loser has no reason not to go all the way once an act worthy of StrikeThree has been committed. He’s already getting the maximum sentence; anythingelse he does to evade capture is without risk.The Bitch is a fascinatingstory of how close any of us might be to the edge, where a single event couldchange our lives forever for the worse. True, few of us are twice-convictedfelons, but it’s only the scale of Jake’s misfortune that differs. We’re allone phone call--chance meeting, lost job, medical emergency, car crash, randomact of violence—away from a situation where every option is a bad one, and themost likely favorable outcome is to slow the rate at which your life circlesthe toilet while hoping for a miracle. Read The Bitch. If it doesn’t affect you on multiplelevels, read it again. You weren’t paying attention the first time.Thanks, Dana! He made a prescient observation when he compared it to Scott Smith's A SIMPLE PLAN. That's how this novel came to be, actually. Some years ago, my then-agent Jimmy Vines asked me to write a novel along the lines of Smith's book and this was the result. I'm so glad he didn't ask me to write one along the lines of LITTLE WOMEN... That would have been difficult...If the folks here are looking for some great noir and/or thrillers, check out any of Dana's books--they're superb!Blue skies,Les P.S. This morning, along with seeing this review, I received an email from the great Ken Bruen who had just read THE BITCH and THE RAPIST and, while I hadn't asked him for a blurb--I sent him these two books (via an intro from mutual buddy Larry DeVore) and simply because I just wanted to get on his radar because I respect him so much as a writer--here's what he wrote:Dear Les              Thank you so much for the books and the superb novels.You sure have lived the life and have a nice light touch in describing it.I loved the novels.Here is my blurb Les Edgerton is the reincarnation of our beloved Eddie Bunker.The writing is as tough and tender as Bunker with that wonderful sense of dry humour that underpins even the most violent of scenes.This guy can write and like a focused Bukowski.Make no mistake, here is the real deal.The books cry out for movie deals. Warmest wishesKen If you catch me this morning, you'll see me with a grin from ear to ear that I can't wipe off!"},

He is an ex-con and served twoyears for a single charge of burglary, reduced from 182, two strong-armrobberies, an armed robbery, and a count of possession with intent to deal.Today, he's completely reformed. Prior to this Les served in the U.S. Navy as acryptographer during the Cuban Crisis and the beginning of the Vietnam War.After making parole Les obtained a B.A. from Indiana University and thenreceived his MFA in Writing (Fiction) from Vermont College.

His prisonsentence is a long way behind him. Life is good. He’s married and is about tostart his own business. But then an old cell mate, Walker Joy, arrives on thescene. He once saved Jake’s life and is demanding repayment in the shape of aburglary he needs help pulling. The problem for Jake is The Bitch – thethree strikes and you’re out rule. He can’t say yes, but he daren’t say no…Appraisal:This is the third Les Edgerton book I’ve read and reviewed.All have been different in style. The others, The Rapist and JustLike That both started with a bang. However The Bitch is more of aslow burn. Jake initially meets Walker out of a sense of duty and friendship(a theme that runs throughout the novel) but soon discovers he’s been betrayed.In prison Jake told Walker about a couple of crimes he hadn’t been caught forand Walker (a less than reputable and trustworthy individual) spilled them to ajeweler friend, Spencer. It’s Spencer who wants the robbery to go ahead and heuses every means to rope Jake in – including falsely accusing Jake’s brother ofa crime.What’s particularly smart about The Bitch is thesteady ramp up of tension and pressure with every chapter as Jake gets drawndeeper and deeper in. As he spills from one event to another nothing goes quiteright, so the implications steadily increase – from robbery, to kidnap andeventually to murder. Jake is trying to find a way of getting his old life backand keeping his misdeeds from his wife. But he can’t.As previously mentioned relationships are absolutely key to TheBitch. Good and bad. Towards the end Edgerton reveals why Jake couldn’tsimply stroll away from Walker, he owes him a lot. Edgerton also takes Jake’soptions away one by one to the point that there’s a sad inevitability about theending, like a car crash you can see coming, but can’t and don’t want to avoid.This is a really enjoyable story. Very well written andhighly compelling. The characters are strong, the dialogue rough and tough.Well worth picking up.FYI:Some swearing.Format/Typo Issues:None.Rating: ***** Five StarsLabels:5 Star, CrimeFiction, fiction,Noir Thanks, Keith--I really appreciate this and am delighted that you liked it.Blue skies,Les"},

Hope you enjoy ‘em. I sure did!For THE BITCHBy M. P. Vernon(Blythe, CA) - See all my reviews(REAL NAME)   This review is from: The Bitch (Paperback) \"The Bitch. Three strikes and you're out. Ha-bitch-ualcriminal. One more pop and I knew the judge would be peering down at me overhis wireframes and saying, \"Jacob Bishop, I hereby sentence you to life imprisonment.Have a nice day, loser.\"And in one paragraph. Les Edgerton not only explains the title but sets thestage for his crime noir masterpiece about bad choices and even worseconsequences.The premise is a common enough one. ex-con Jacob Bishop. with two strikesagainst him, gets out of prison, falls in love and gets his life together. Heand his pregnant wife are about ready to open their own business when his oldcell mate shows up with a proposition involving a heist. It's bad enough that Jacobowes his friend for saving his life but other secrets are out too and blackmailis not out of the question.From that point on, the dominoes fall and Jacob is in over his head...perhaps.Edgerton has not set up the most original plot, yet this book stands about theothers in one major way. I dislike novels where the protagonists continue tomake stupid illogical choices. Jacob's decisions may be stupid but they are notillogical. They fit well in the mindset of the characters and the situationsthey are presented. They fell real and logical based on the fact they are themaking the best decisions in the best, if corrupted and unhealthy, way theyknow how. This is something I know a little about, having worked with paroleesand probationers. As wild as the action gets, I felt it could happen. Perhaps afew too many people coincidentally end up in the wrong place at the wrong time.Also his girl friend maybe falls in line a little too easy. Yet these are minorannoyances considering how riveting the novel is and how well the action andconsequences flow.Edgerton has a gritty style and excels in the street wise, prison accenteddialog that permeates this tale. This is one of those story that never let up.I think I put th book down once to answer the phone but that was it. It has analmost perfect ending. Some may think it is a little too open and sudden but Ithought it was just right. With one novel, Edgerton has entered my short listof favorite suspense thriller writers, including Charlie Huston and Joe R.Lansdale and he is giving hard-nosed icons like Mickey Spillane a run for themoney.A word or two about the publisher. This was the second book I've read from NewPulp Press. The other one was Last of the Smoking Bartenders by C. J. Howell.New Pulp Press seems to specialize in thrillers and suspense with a literarybent. Emphasis on the word \"literary\". From the two books I've read,I can say it is an exceptional small publishing company and it would beworthwhile to keep a eye on them...not to mention checking out their pastinventory.5.0 out of 5 stars HolyCrap!, December 18, 2013 By Liam Sweeny - See all my reviewsThis review is from: The Bitch (Kindle Edition) I received an advanced chance to read this. I'm lucky, andI'll be buying it. Just because.Les Edgerton's \"The Bitch\" is about Jake Bishop, a two-time felonwith a Bitch dangling around his neck: Ha-BITCH-ual criminal, two strikes andone away from life without parole in Indiana's Correctional System. With a newbusiness in the works, a loving wife and a baby on the way, Jake feels the glowof the sun, a chance to be a \"straight\" (law-abiding citizen).But then he gets the call from Walker Joy.Former cellmate and trusted inside-friend, Walker is out and back to tricks.He's in a bind, and Jake owes him. Walker's in with Sydney Spencer, a shadyblack market jeweler, and there's a \"piece of cake\" job that Jake isuniquely suited to do. But Jake's tasted the dawn, and as the darkness beginsto creep up at his heels he wants to run. Jake soon finds that running's not aseasy as it should be, and with the Bitch hanging over his head, the nightlooms.There is so much to this book. It's the perspective. It's the sublime wisdomembedded in Jake's narration. It's the madness that you can taste as Edgertonguides you through twists and turns that stain the carpets and trunk liners. It'sthe little things that throw you because the story keeps you looking the otherway. It makes Jake's descent real.Edgerton's style is dynamic, never giving you the time to get easy with thedrudgery of getting through some passage. I had to re-read a paragraph or twobecause I was still stunned by the one sentence that came before it. Yeah, it'sthat kind of book.Read it on a day off. Clear the day. Put on a pot of coffee. Trust me.I will recommend The Bitch to anyone who's capable of enjoying darkness, orjust a good book. I would also recommend this to anyone thinking of a life ofcrime.Recentreviews of THE RAPIST 5.0 out of 5 stars Genius!,January 22, 2014 By W.J. Whaley - See all my reviewsAmazon Verified Purchase(What's this?) This review is from: The Rapist (Kindle Edition) This book is simply genius. Genius to the point that I findit trying to even write a review worthy enough to describe said genius. I knewLes Edgerton was good, but DANG! This book demonstrated his abilities on awhole other level.I won’t lie. When I saw the title of the book there was a little apprehensionon my part to make the purchase. The cover is quite troubling, and thetitle….well I think that speaks for itself. However, being a big Edgerton fan,I knew I had to take the plunge. I am damn happy I did!The protagonist, Truman Pinter, is a rapist, sociopath, and essentially a guyyou will absolutely despise. Edgerton writes this character in way that shouldbe studied by future and current authors. In fact, after reading the book, I amnot at all surprised Les writes self-help books on the craft of writing.The Rapist is a must read book. It’s flawlessly written, and the ending willleave you speechless.         5.0 out of 5 stars         Made me think about things in new and interesting ways, November 26, 2013              By Deb (South Florida)  - See all my reviews        This review is from: The Rapist (Paperback)      To me, this was an interesting journey through a man's thoughts about himself, his perceptions of our world and himself in it and humanity.  Several times I paused to think on what I'd read.  It was often like looking through a kaleidoscope and having it turned, with new perspective awaiting me.5.0 out of 5 stars Dynamicliterature, you'll want to read more than once!, December 31, 2013 By Chloe - See all my reviewsThis review is from: The Rapist (Kindle Edition) Wowza!This is not my first Les Edgerton novel, but one I procrastinated aboutreading. If I like an author's style and storytelling ability, I rarely readreviews, etc., and just plunge into their latest writing. Mr. Edgerton is themaster of \"The Hook\" and even though the title didn't appeal to me,the moment I began reading Greek Mythology and literary references intertwinedwithin Truman Pinter's condescending narrative addressing simple-mindedreaders, I couldn't close my Kindle. Other readers were likely hooked by adesire to know whether or not this death row inmate had actually committed thecrime for which he is awaiting a firing squad. I've learned to never expect thesame ole, same ole read from Mr. Edgerton, but The Rapist totally blew me awaybecause I expected NOT to like it due to my own misconception. The rape fromwhich the title is drawn, received only a fraction of mention in this dynamicpiece of literature.Succinctly told without relying on dramatic tricks, this novella is in itself adramatic character study destined to leave each reader with unique opinion. Ihad to utilize my Kindle Thesaurus a few times, so once again I gained greatereducation via an extraordinary novel - or novella in this case. The Rapistcontains a plethora of brilliant references, and on my second read I realizedI'd missed a few due to becoming absorbed in the arrogance of protagonist,Pinter.I'm not a polished reviewer, so I'll just say, WOWZA! This thought provokingbody of work leaves readers with diverse conclusions, yet I believe most feelgratification and a resurrection of intellect. Go. Buy.

Gundrum(San Francisco) - See all my reviews(REAL NAME)   Amazon Verified Purchase(What's this?) This review is from: The Rapist (Paperback) Les Edgerton’s The Rapist lures through prurient interestof a heinous crime and the promise to peek into the mind of the rapist. Therapist, Truman, is unrepentant, even spiteful and arrogant toward those whowould judge him. He is a condemned man, sits in a cell awaiting execution. Herecalls his crime and his hates, even an infant hate. Complexity andcontradiction nudge their way in. (Is there an app for that? Did the Kindlebrighten a bit? What am I reading here? What happens to a soul?) Edgertontracks Truman’s thoughts and dreams, which are unusual and particular—in thisway creating an uncanny realism of an individual mind. The book evokesconsideration of art and life. It does not debate right and wrong but aimshigher: the possibility of salvation.The book is profound yet easy to read. It begins as smut, some pages feeldirty. It is a slim book with a tightly woven narrative of surprises, ideas,even jokes. There would never be a love child between Henry Miller and AlbertCamus but such an invention comes to mind for the book is one of a kind.My heartfelt thanks to all the folks who’ve contributed areview.Blue skies,Les"},
{"title": "MARK MATTHEWS' Review of THE BITCH--Five Stars", "date": "Wednesday, January 22, 2014", "text": "Hi folks,Here's another review of THE BITCH that just came out on Mark Matthews' blog, Running, Writing and Chasing the Dragon: Wednesday, January 22, 2014Book Review - A  Fantastic Piece of Crime Noir Being in non-marathon training mode and running less miles means more time reading. I have being doing book reviews all over the place, and I am now a guest reviewer at both Bookie-Monster.com and SilkScreenViews. A few of my favorites I am going to share here. I picked up this piece of crime fiction from netgalley and am so glad I did. Five tremendous stars burning so bright they melted my eyelids right off. First off, I should note that the title \"The Bitch\" is in reference to the main character's fear of being labeled a \"Ha-Bitch-ual\" criminal.  More on that later. Here's the premise:Ex-con Jake Bishop is several years past his second stint in prison and has completely reformed. He’s married, expecting a child, and preparing to open his own hair salon. But then an old cellmate re-enters his life begging for a favor: to help him with a burglary. Forced by his code of ethics to perform the crime, Jake’s once idyllic life quickly plunges into an abyss. Jake soon realizes that there is only one way out of this purgatory . . . and it may rupture his soul beyond repair.Sure, you may  have seen this done before: Ex-con trying to fly straight and be a family man gets called back into the lifestyle. But this author does it so well that it never gets trite. Feels like true crime, with a language that is never forced. The tension escalated beautifully. Unpredictable, yet always getting higher, like the tick, tick, ticking noise you hear the roller coaster make as you climb that first hill. You weren't sure what twist it was going to take, only that the author showed so much skill you would trust it would be somewhere interesting. You get to know the main character so well, that it's hard not to take him out of the book and back home with you.As far as the title referring to the legal implications of being labeled a \"Ha-Bitch-ual\" criminal, I don't think the author would mind you thinking otherwise. In some ways, the main character lets his past make him his bitch, so to speak, by trying to live by the code of his old world and be happy in the new. Likewise, his wife, tries a 'cross-over' with similar results. There is moral ambiguity here and a value system that the main character has that you don't have to admire, but you will certainly feel it along the way. As the main character, Jake, goes rifling through what to do next, you want to scream out to him, \"Dude, did you realize you just ((spoiler alert)) how are you going to shoot a move through this one?\"I have to believe that crime fiction speaks to the voyeur in all of us. The part who want to know how criminals live and what they think. And the best crime fiction makes us realize they are one of us, or we are one of them. We find ourselves identifying with the character at some parts, wishing they had more of a moral compass at other parts. We may get disgusted at their choices, other times we may just wish they'd be more slick and get away with it. All of these things and more crossed my mind as I committed crimes alongside Jake and Walker. Read this for the story, for the plot, for the characters, and for the concise as a concrete slab prose. If you are lucky like me, you can read it at your parents cottage, isolated, surrounded by snow, which was exactly the setting the characters found themselves in as they tried to cover the tracks of their misdeeds. I was able to go home and live happily ever after with my family. The characters of this book may have not been so lucky.Thank you, Mark! The reviews are starting to mount up and sales have been terrific!Blue skies,Les"},

The day my novel THE BITCH launches from New Pulp Press. And, here's the first review from author Scott Adlerberg and it's a corker!SCOTT ADLERBERG'S MYSTERIOUS ISLANDOn Books, Writing, Movies, and Whatever Else.Monday, January 20, 2014The Bitch by Les EdgertonI'm a huge admirer of Les Edgerton's novel THE RAPIST, so when I started his novel THE BITCH, I had high expectations.  Not that I was expecting to read a book remotely like THE RAPIST, a masterpiece of  the darkest type of existential crime fiction, but I had little doubt that I'd be in the hands of a crime fiction practitioner par excellence.  How pleasant it is when your expectations are met, when a writer you've set the highest standard for meets that standard and exceeds it.THE BITCH is about Jake Bishop, an ex-con in Indiana who has a lovely young wife, a baby on the way, and a teenaged brother he's caring for.  Jake was once a burglar, but since his last stint in jail, he has done his best to stay straight. And he's succeeded.  He has a trade - he's a hairstylist in a salon - and he has ambition: he and his wife are saving money to start their own salon.  He used to drink too much but hasn't fallen off the wagon in a long time. Things seem pretty good. Of course, in a book like this, in noir land, if things seem okay, you know they won't be okay for long.  Everything will turn sour quickly. And for Jake life begins to rot the day his old cellmate turns up asking him for a favor.  The cellmate's name is Walker Joy, and from the moment Bishop makes the mistake of letting Joy back into his life, Bishop experiences precious little of that particular word. It's no secret that Les Edgerton did time himself, years ago.  And in all Jake's thoughts and descriptions about jail there is an authenticity that I'm sure in part derives from Edgerton's experience.  But living through something and writing about it are two entirely different things, and what makes THE BITCH such a great read is Edgerton's flat-out skill.  Though he may be drawing upon past experience for his raw material, it's the imagination he applies to that material and the substantial craft he wields that make this book work.  THE BITCH is a novel that unfolds in a way both entirely plausible and heavily plotted, no small feat.  There are twists and turns galore, yet nothing that happens seems forced or arbitrary.  Indeed, while reading the novel, I felt as if I was reading a textbook example of a particular type of noir story.  It's the crime story where one wrong decision by the main character, just one, is enough to send his entire life sliding downhill.  It doesn't matter if the decision is based on an honorable intention.  Bishop knows helping Walker is not the wisest decision, but he feels he owes the man because Walker helped him a lot in prison. Walker even saved his life in prison.  Naturally, Walker brings up this debt, and that's where he hooks Bishop.  Never mind that the debt is related to prison garbage that has nothing to do with the outside world. Bishop feels he must honor it.  His sense of having a cellmate code, his loyalty to the past - these are his weaknesses.  He agrees to help Walker and from that instant, the die is cast.  THE BITCH unfolds like a nightmare after that; a mixture of bad judgment, small lies, mental errors, and plain old bad luck enfold Bishop in a web of deceit and criminal acts that threaten to destroy everything he's built since he last got released from prison.  It's almost as if, his statements to the contrary, he can't wait to go back to jail.And who exactly is the Bitch?  Whatis the Bitch? It's not a woman, I can tell you that, because no woman dreamt up by a man, even a women-fearing man, could be as terrifying as this sucker.  The Bitch pertains to something relevant for a repeat offender like Jake, and it hangs over his every move like the oppressive hand of Fate.  Does he control anything?  The thing in life he least wants to do is return to prison, and nearly everything he does as his situation worsens he does to avoid returning to prison, but the image of the Bitch plagues his thoughts night and day.  He struggles against the magnetic pull of the Bitch, and though we don't want to get optimistic reading a work of noir like this, we hope against hope that he can resolve his situation well. For the duration of the book, I was rooting for Jake to pull off the seemingly impossible, and that I cared so much for him is a testament to Edgerton's ability to make you understand Jake. You understand everything that makes him tick, and despite his actions, you sympathize with him. You're willing to forgive him almost anything to see him escape the vise he's in.If I were teaching a course on literary noir, THE BITCH is a book I'd choose for class study.  It's perfectly constructed and has nary a wasted word.  It's a stark tale of a man fighting as hard as he can against himself, the world, Nature, Fate; and it's a book that, once started, you don't want to put down.  It's the kind of book an old Hollywood master like Fritz Lang would have made a great film from, and I can only hope someone in today's film biz still reads novels and finds this one.  Finds it, and then decides to adapt it.  It would make a wonderful movie.  And by the way, while I'm at it, let me throw out a word of thanks to New Pulp Press for re-issuing this. THE BITCH deserves a wide audience. Thank you so much, Scott! This was a wonderful way to start my day! And, sorry for the jumbled way it appeared here--my bad entirely! I did a cut and paste and this is the way it turned out and I'm a total doofus in doing things like this.Click on the cover for ordering info--it's available both as an ebook and as a paperback.Blue skies,Les"},
{"title": "INTERVIEW WITH RENATO BRATKOVIC on RADIKALNEWS", "date": "Saturday, January 18, 2014", "text": "Hi folks,Just did an interview with Renato Bratkovic on his blog RADIKALNEWS.Here's the interview:AConversation With Les EdgertonI am bothpleased and honored to have a chance to ask Les Edgerton a couple of questions.Les doesn’t need any introduction, as he is a well known fiction writer (TheRapist, Just Like That, Gumbo Ya-Ya: Stories, and The Bitch that comes out onJanuary 20th), always ready to support his fellow writers and who also kindlyshares his knowledge of the craft (Finding Your Voice: How to Put Personalityin Your Writing, Hooked: Write Fiction That Grabs Readers at Page One &Never Lets Them Go). There’s another writer that I think of, when I see or hearLes – the great late Eddie Bunker, who’s also been there and seen things and …yeah, written about them, although Les tells stories with his own voice and acomparison is made only out of respect. Check his author blog tolearn about writing, and – of course – the Amazonto buy his books.Hi, Les, it’s an honor to have you here – can you tell us a bit about yourselfwith your own words please?Thanks for having me, Renato—it’s an honor… and promises to be fun!I guess to begin with—I’m an ex-con who’s now reformed and has taken a vow ofpoverty—become a writer. I’m no longer ‘in the life’ not because I’ve had some‘come to Jesus’ moment, but because I’ve been to prison and don’t have much ofa burning desire to return. So far, no crimes have presented themselves withenough upside that I’d consider worth the risk should things go south. If onedid, I wouldn’t consult a minister to make a decision—I’d just weigh the prosand cons. It would have to be a healthy seven-figure opportunity with alow-risk factor to make me say yes. Probably not gonna happen.While many people don’t want to be defined by their work, I have no problem atall with being defined by mine, which is writing. It’s what I do and what Iam—a writer.What changed my life was my wife, Mary. I think of my life in two parts: B.M.and A.M. We met in an unusual way. We were both waiting in the outer office ofthe U.S. Marshall’s, waiting to get our new identities in the WitnessProtection Program, and struck up a conversation. Her crime had something to dowith large numbers of sheep and Black&Decker power tools, which is all Iknow. The rest, as they say, is history. We can honestly claim that ourrelationship is a product of a Stockholm Syndrome situation gone right.We keep the romance alive! Every Friday night, I draw her a hot bath, strewrose petals on the water and break out five brand-new Bic razors. Then, I shaveher back. I highly recommend this for newly-weds who don’t want to lose the newcar smell of their relationship.It’s also important to not be a phony when you compliment your SignificantOther. Here’s an example: One time, she asked me to take out the garbage and Isaid: Nope. You cooked it, you take it out. They know when you’re being realand when you’re just blowing smoke… Keep it real.Also, keep all the sharp instruments and ammunition hidden.Youwrite a edgy, right in the face, no bullshit fiction, and your characters saythings the way you believe them – it seems like a routine, how did you achievethat kind of style?Just by being myself. When you speak the truth it doesn’t take a lot of effort.Writing is just another form of communication and all any communication is isgetting the image in my brain over to yours. It isn’t nuclear physics. And,being truthful makes it easy. Ask any cop. It’s why they keep asking the samequestions, over and over, to a perp. If he’s lying, he’ll fuck up, eventually,and there you go. If you always tell the truth, there’s just not that problem.Also, I write mostly crime novels and since I was a criminal for a very longtime, I know how at least one criminal thinks and acts and what goes on in thelife. I don’t have to invent much. A lot of the time, I just reach back andpull out a story from my own life.A long time ago, when I was just a tadpole, I knew I wanted to be a writer andat that time, I thought the best way to be good at that was to accumulateexperiences ala Jack London. So, that’s what I did. Then, just a few years ago,I read an interview with Flannery O’Connor and she said that if a person livedin the same little town until they were 17, they had enough material towrite for the rest of their lives. Just wish I’d found that out a long timeago—it would have saved me a lot of grief!Except… I’m really grateful for all of my experiences and particularly the badones. Fiction is about one thing only and that’s trouble and although I knowthe so-called ‘literary writers’ seem to be able to dredge that trouble up fromheavy-duty contemplation of their navels and the lint in there, I have a ton ofvery concrete bad situations to draw upon and I see that as a positive thing.Just don’t have to put a mind-fuck on stuff. Just tell a story and know it’strue as monkey sex and I don’t have to spend all that time staring at my navel,even though it’s an ‘innie’ and very attractive as belly buttons go. It alwaysseems that in reading some of those kinds of writers that one could easily geta hernia straining so hard to make something out of so little…If you think about it, the bad experiences are the ones most of us remember thebest and the most fondly. Look at all those guys who dwell on their two orthree years in the Army, especially if it was during a wartime. How many peopledo you know remember the year they inherited daddy’s fortune as their bestmemory? Over the year they spent in Europe, living in a garret and eating Ramannoodles to survive? It’s not only trouble that illuminates fiction; it’strouble that illuminates our lives and our memories. Trouble is what we measureourselves against. Scarcely anyone measures their own self-value against theday Daddy gave them the keys to their first Mercedes. If they do, they’re a sadperson I think.We need the bad times to let us know the value of the good times. We talk about‘going through the fire.’ Very rarely do we talk about ‘going through thegentle spring rain.’ Fire forges character. Gentle spring rain forges… I’m notsure what it forges but it isn’t character.Youare very generous, when it comes to sharing your knowledge and technique, butnot only that – you also put a great deal of humor into texts, that couldotherwise be dull, and you definitely are an authority, a guru of writing even.We know writing is fun, but how do you make reading about writing fun?Well, if writing is done right, it is fun. I defy anyone to show me anyactivity that’s more fun over a sustained period. And, I know there’s a thingcalled sex and it’s pretty neat and all that, but you’re talking about twentyminutes to an hour, normally (more with drugs and/or alcohol, of course) twicea week if you’re married, but writing is a 24/7 activity. Even when I’m havingsex, the experience is already making its way into a story… One of my wivesnailed it when she said to me after our divorce, ‘I was just material, wasn’tI?’ She was right… And, I believe in only two absolute rules about writing. Tobe successful, it needs to be clear and it needs to be interesting. And, if youcan only do one of those two, you can fudge on the clear part. It’s absolutelyimperative to be interesting.It’s also important that we realize that this isn’t nuclear physics. Knowingthat alone lightens the text…Also, humor is decidedly a criminal trait. It’s how we get through a lot of themisery we find ourselves in. You’ll hear more sick jokes around a dead bodythan anywhere else. That’s from both sides—cops and criminals. My wife hatesthat about me. I’ll crack on stuff she thinks is SERIOUS SHIT and she thinks Ineed to spend some time on a shrink’s couch. She’s probably right but I don’twant her to know she’s right so I just tell her to go lay down by her dish…Well, I don’t say that out loud…The funniest shit I ever heard in my life was the time this guy came into therec room at Pendleton and proceeded to smack a guy’s melon a couple of rowsahead of me about sixty-eleven times with a claw hammer. Everybody had a jokegoing ten seconds after the guy walked away. Dave Barry would have gotten twobooks worth of material at the yuks we were throwing around then. We probablyhave a different kind of sense of humor than you’d find at a life insurancesales convention… or maybe not…Howdo you see the writer’s role – as an educator, a world changer, or just astoryteller, whose primary mission is to entertain a reader, to give him agreat experience in exchange for a couple of hours?I’m with Isaac Bashavits Singer on this one, who, when asked very nearly thesame question, replied that he just told stories. Is there a more noblecalling? Not in my mind.Whatdoes your typical work day look like?I wake up around 4:30 and my wife brings me a pill I have to take before I caneat anything or drink coffee for an hour. I watch TV or sleep for that hour andthen I’m up and lunging for my first of probably 8-9 cups of coffee for theday. After the Three S’s in the bathroom (where I read), I hit my computer andI’m there all day, only moving to take an occasional piss. I drink coffee allday long and smoke cigarettes. I don’t eat breakfast or lunch, usually, simplybecause I’m not hungry and it takes away writing time. I have literallyhundreds of books all around me, plus my Kindle, and I take frequent breaks toread. Reading is the single most important activity for a writer to engage in.I was going to add ‘imo’ but didn’t because it’s just the truth.My wife comes home anywhere from six to eight at night and we have supper(during which I read). I go back up to my computer until around 8:30 and thenwe go to bed. I do this seven days a week.I usually have an average of a couple of dozen writing projects that I’mworking on. I don’t believe in such a thing as writer’s block any more than aplumber thinks there’s such a thing as plumber’s block. Both of us just do thework. If I get bored on one thing, I just close that file and open up anotherone. A lot of my day is spent doing things that to non-writers might not seemlike writing but they are. I have a class of novel-writing students whose workI go over each day. I also have private writing clients and I do the same withthem. I’m online also and most of what I do there has to do with writing. Iread constantly and according to my Kindle average 3-4 novels per week.Howdo you start to write? Do you work out the plot, do you research a lot, or doyou just sit down and write out of your head?With a novel, it has to percolate in my mind for about seven-eight years. Ialways have 4-5 novels simmering and add a few each year to replace the onesI’ve written. When I’m ready to write it, I pretty much know where it’s goingto go. I write a different kind of outline—it consists of 15-20 words. Fivestatements that comprise the entire novel. One statement that describes theinciting incident that begins the trouble that’s going to be the basis of thenovel. Three statements describing the three major turning points almost allnovels have. One statement describing the resolution. It’s my road map. If I wasgoing to drive to Adak, Alaska, I’d get a map. It’s the same with a novel. Imay get there by just driving north, but I imagine it’d take a lot longer anduse up a lot more gas. This kind of outline gives me a sound grasp of it—tocome up with this kind of outline means I have to have given it some thought,which I’ve found many writers haven’t and is why their book peters out ataround page 70-80. They usually didn’t have a story but what the late BlakeSnyder termed ‘the smell of the rain on the road at dawn.’ If I come up with atwist in the plot I didn’t envision going in, then I just take twenty minutesand rewrite my outline and I’m right back on the highway. Here’s perhaps a goodexample. I have a short story, a novel, and a screenplay of the same story… andI’ve used the same outline for all three. And, while all three were centeredaround the same main plot points, each was a very different story.A short story is a different kind of animal. Since they don’t have that samearc as a novel—that Freitag scheme doesn’t apply to short stories since thecharacter doesn’t have to change profoundly but only experience a tiny bit ofinsight—they don’t require the same kind of preparation at all.Because of what I write—mostly about crime—I don’t have much need to research.My life has been research. Now, if I was an insurance salesman and wanted towrite about crime, I guess I’d probably have to do some research. But, I was acriminal for a long, long time and therefore I truly do write what I know.Also, I’ve been doing this a long, long time, so I know how to jump in andbalance all the elements and keep it going in my head without messing up.Anovel or a short story – which is more fun to write for you?A novel, for sure! I quit writing short stories years ago, mostly because therewasn’t any money in them and there were very few readers. It was also reallyhard to get short stories published in those days. There were probably only acouple of dozen litmags that were considered quality and less than six or seventhat were really worthwhile to get published in. The New Yorker, Paris Review—afew like that. Mostly, though, I just want more time with my characters thanshort stories allow. Nowadays, because of the Internet, there are bazillions ofplaces to place short stories. Unfortunately, it’s become so easy, many of theones that we see are… what’s the word I’m looking for?… oh, yeah… crapola. Isee more and more of these things that seem to be written not only by peoplewho don’t know a thing about crime but seem to feel that the cruder they areand the more screwed up and on drugs they can make their characters and themore vile things they can make their characters do, that that’s somehow noir orcrime writing There just don’t seem to be any editors these days in an awfullot of those places. That said, I’ve also read some truly amazing short storieson the ‘net. Ten percent are quite good. It just takes a mighty effort to plowthrough all the white noise sometimes… And, even though there are a lot moreplaces now, it’s difficult to think of many that are equal to the Paris Review.Not sure if any are at that level yet.Yourfiction could easily translate into pictures. Have you ever written (or thoughtabout writing) for film or TV?I have. Years ago, I was teaching for the UCLA Writer’s Workshop and when youteach for them, you’re allowed to take other classes for free. So, I took SteveDuncan’s workshop on screenwriting. I’d never seen a screenplay before that,but on the second day, Steve called me up and told me to drop the class, thatit wouldn’t do me any good. He said just get Trottier’s THE SCREENWRITER’SBIBLE, and learn formatting (which he said would take about ten minutes… and hewas right) and then he’d like me to co-write a script with him. Well, first Idecided to take a stab at writing one myself so I did. Took two days,literally. I wrote for eight hours the first day and then, two weeks later,picked it up again and finished it in seven hours. Now, anyone can write a badscript in two days… or even less… but this script became a semifinalist in theNicholl’s and a finalist in both the Writer’s Guild and Best of Austincompetitions, so I’d say it was vetted. Screenwriting isn’t writing, imo. It’sridiculously easy for one thing and it’s just not writing. I don’t believeanyone’s ever curled up in a hammock to read a screenplay unless they were adirector or producer or actor and they were just doing their job. I don’t writethem any more mostly because I just don’t think much of the form. We all havelimited time and I just don’t want to waste my time on something I don’trespect. Money’s never been my motivation for writing in the least, and I can’tfigure any other reason to write screenplays other than the gelt.Plus, I’m too old for Hollywood. After the age of 35, it’s really difficult tosell anything, no matter what they tell people in all these university filmprograms. Hollywood is up-front and honest about it—they practice ageism and don’tmake any bones about it. The primary market is teenaged boys and they justdon’t think anyone over the age of 35 can understand that demographic and writefor it. Do older writers sometimes sell scripts? Well, outside of theestablished screenwriters who are that age or older… very, very rarely. Ithappens but then there are people who’ve won two back-to-back lottieries. Theodds are about the same. The chances are much better for an older writer to geta novel published than a screenplay sold. Plus, who in the heck wants to writestuff teenaged boys find interesting? Have you talked to one of them lately?See what I mean?If someone wants to take any of my stuff and make a movie, go for it. Iwouldn’t object… but I wouldn’t want to spend the time writing it myself. Justsend me a check. Hire that 20-year-old to screw it up and just send me themoney and tell me the nearest theater it’s playing in.Whatare you working at the moment (if it’s not a top secret)?My writing isn’t top secret at all! Now… the work I’m doing on the newhydrogen-fallipalooza bomb I’m making out of mayonaisse and a secret ingredientis, but since you didn’t ask about that, I’m fine.I’m working on a bunch of things. A final rewrite for my memoir, AdrenalineJunkie. That’s my main project presently. I just got notes for it from a writerI really respect, Ben Sobieck, and I’m busy rewriting it according to hisconsiderable wisdom. Several novels. Two are thrillers. One is about a hit manwho specializes in doing hits and making them look like accidents. It’s gonnabe a manual for the folks who are anxious to perform the perfect crime and needsome guidance. Another is about another kind of hit man who only does hits onfolks who escape proper justice. He watches TV shows like ID and finds peoplewho’ve done heinous crimes but draw light sentences. Maybe a guy wiped out anentire family and raped everyone in the family unit including the family dogbefore decapitating them… and then, because he lives in California draws asentence of six and a half years (with a heavy dose of counseling…). My guyfinds these folks when they get out and exterminates them. Kind of a Death Wishon steroids. A new writer’s how to, based on films. Bunch of other stuff.I like the hit man motif. In my version, he gets away with it. So many peoplethink that all criminals get caught and that’s just not true. We only hearabout the ones that did. Trust me—lots of criminals don’t get caught. If itwasn’t for that pesky statute of limitations deal, I might even mention some ofmine. It’s like gambling. There’s this myth that all gamblers eventually lose.Just not so. I made my entire living for four years gambling and the onlyreason I quit was that I made it mostly by betting middles and amateur, weekendbettors ruined it for us. I had a good friend who inherited a chain ofsupermarkets who ended up selling them and made a great living the rest of hislife from gambling, far more than the couple of million a year he made fromselling groceries. The ones who end up losing are usually the amateurs. If I goto a casino and see someone playing the slots or roulette, or betting on theshooter at the craps table, that’s the guy I want in my private poker game…Bring the rent money, pal…There’s a reason we call straights ‘lames’…Howimportant do you find social media for your writing and promoting it? Which ismore relevant, Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn …?I’m not sure. I suspect it isn’t all that important. On my blog I have a littleover 300 followers so that isn’t going to catapault me onto the bestsellerlists even if every one of ‘em buys ten copies of a book. (Although, I hopethat doesn’t stop any of them from doing so if they were planning to…) Where Ido think it’s important as a writer is that I get exposed to writers I wouldn’tbe aware of otherwise. I’ve been introduced to a ton of really top writers thatI wouldn’t have without the ‘net. A lot from Europe, in particular. As forwhich media is more relevant, I’m not sure if any of them are, but I’m probablywrong. I often am. Ask any of my four ex-wives. Maybe even my current one…Agents and editors seem to think that it’s important. They’re always askingabout one’s ‘platform.’ I’m not convinced that 325 followers constitute a‘platform’ but if so I’m there… I kind of suspect they think it’s importantbecause they read other agent’s and other editor’s blogs and see them toutingit so… If any of those folks are reading this, I’m trying. I’m really trying.Whoare your literary heroes?I have bazillions of literary heroes! Anyone who writes well is my hero. Iwon’t name living ones just because after we finish here I’ll think of someoneI forgot and I’ll feel terrible. Plus, the list would be in the hundreds. Amongthe dead ones there are also bazillions. Probably the biggest heroes for me arefolks like Camus, Borges, Celine, Ray Carver, Flannery O’Connor, Chekhov,Bukowski, Harry Crews, Faulkner, Hemingway, not Fitzgerald, Mark Twain, JohnDonne, Nabakov, Isaac Bashavits Singer, James Crumley—just lots and lots and lotsof writers. You’ll notice there isn’t but one woman in that list. That’sbecause until recently I read very few women. It just seemed that most of themwrote about ‘relationships’ and that’s not a subject that interests me in theleast. Lately though, I’ve been reading a lot of women writers. Contemporarywriters. It seems they’ve been freed up to write about things I don’t thinkthey felt they were able to in yesteryear and today’s women writers areabsolutely fantastic and I read a lot of them. I often wonder what Louisa MayAlcott would have written about if she’d felt free to write anything she wantedto and get published—I’ll bet a dollar Jo and Meg would be involved withleather more than they were and might be getting their groove on in differentways that they did… We really kept women writers down for far too long of atime… hell, keeping them down for ten minutes was too long, but we did it forcenturies. And, now, they’re starting to kick our ass!Whatadvise would you give to a young (or maybe not so young) writer, who’s juststarting to think of becoming a writer?Don’t write. Take up fingerpainting or brain surgery.Why in the heck should I encourage competition?Kidding! I can’t give any better advice than Jim Harrison did when he advised anyonewanting to become a writer to ‘read the whole of Western literature for thepast 2,000 years… and then, if time permits, to read the whole of Easternliterature for the same period of time.’ For, he said, ‘if you don’t know whatpassed for good in the past, how can you know what passes for good today?’Reading is how one learns to become a writer. Period.Thankyou, Les!Totally my pleasure, Renato. I know going in that my answers might piss somepeople off and if so that makes me happy, happy, happy! If a writer ever saysor writes anything that doesn’t offend someone, I don’t think he or she has aright to call themselves a writer. It’s our job to stir up things and makepeople uncomfortable. It’s for sure the media and politicians don’t do that anymore. Too many people these days have bought into that PC moronic crap anddon’t want to hurt anyone’s little tender feelings. Too bad. Opinions are ourbiggest stock in trade and why would anyone want to hide their goods? It’s whyI love quotes from past generations of writers about other writers. They didn’tpussyfoot around and pretend to like everyone so they’d be liked. Did I mentionI hate PC mushheads? Grow a pair…I’m a very angry person. I write for the same reasons William Gass did—I hate..a lot… and hard. Mostly, I hate bullies and I hate posers and very oftenthey’re the same person. The other side of that coin is that I love an awfullot of people too. I especially love my fellow writers who fight the good fightand keep on keepin’ on. It’s a tough dodge we’ve chosen.And, that's it.

{"title": "MISSED OPPORTUNITIES...", "date": "Saturday, January 11, 2014", "text": "Hi folks,Just saw a post on Facebookby my friend Dean Ehle who said he was looking forward to watching the movieTHE GREEN MILE on TV and it brought back a memory.Not a particularly goodone!You see, I have a tenuousconnection to that particular movie…Years ago, I taught fictionwriting for the UCLA Extension Writer’s Program. As an instructor, I was ableto take free classes from other instructors and vice versa. In a screenwritingclass, I became friends with a delightful young lady from Grand Rapids,Michigan, Jodi Stanley. We began a correspondence that led to her and I and oursignificant others meeting up for drinks and dinner.Well, one day, I got aphone call from Jodi. Turned out, she was sitting in the California living room of a womannamed Mali Finn. Ms. Finn had been her drama teacher in high school and hadsince migrated out to Hollywood where she’d become a casting director for JamesCameron. Jodi was visiting her. The reason Jodi called me was that she’d happened to have a copy ofone of my books, MONDAY’S MEAL, with her, and Mali was looking at it and saw myauthor’s photo on the back. According to Jodi, she began squealing, “This guy’sgot the exact look I’m looking for!” Seems she was casting a movie for some guynamed James Cameron. She asked Jodi if she thought I’d mind her reaching out tome and Jodi didn’t think I’d mind at all. (That’s called an “understatement”for any nonliterary types out there…). Jodi called me at home in FortHooterville and introduced me to Mali and then Mali took over. She explainedshe was casting a movie titled THE GREEN MILE, had seen my picture, and thoughtI had the perfect “look” she wanted for a character in the movie.Well, this is where it getsa bit unbelievable for those of you with a People Magazine subscription. Atthat time, I had no idea who Mali Finn was. I had no idea who James Cameronwas. I had no idea that THE GREEN MILE was a novel by Stephen King. Truth. Iknew who Stephen King was, but wasn’t a big fan. I’d read one book of his—somethingabout a car that comes to life—and, to be honest, thought it was kind of silly.I know he’s a big name and all, but his stuff just isn’t my cup of tea. Sorry,King fans…Anyway, at that point, Irealized vaguely that this Finn person was a bona fide Hollywood person and Jodi had told meCameron was as well (except I didn’t know anything about either one). But, Idid realize she was a for-real person in the film biz and this wasn’t some kindof crank call.So, when she asked if I’dbe willing to do a screen test for the role she had in mind, I said, sure. Onlythen she said there was no money in the budget to fly anyone out for a screen test.They just hadn’t allocated funds for that, figuring they’d get actors from thewaiter/cab driver/phone sex worker pool in L.A. She said I’d have to pay my wayout there and back, but that if I got the role I’d be reimbursed. Reluctantly,I said, “Ma’am, I don’t have enough gas money to get to the other side of Ft.Wayne right now.” I declined and we said a few other pleasantries and that wasthe end of our conversation.Not the photo Mali Finn saw--couldn't locate a copy of it--but this is a photo taken at the same time. If curious about the photo she actually saw, it's here. When you get there, just click on \"Back cover\" and thas' moi...My wife Mary was home atthe time, but hadn’t heard the conversation. When I told her the name of themovie, she knew instantly that it was a Stephen King novel. (She reads People…)We jumped in the car and drove out to Border’s and sure enough—there it was onthe shelf. Actually, there were dozens of copies.We came back home andlooked up James Cameron and found out that he was… a really big deal inHollywood. As was Mali Finn. I think I remember groaning… I’m pretty sure Ifound a bottle and began sipping from it. Bigsips…I figured it was too lateto call Jodi back so I didn’t. Probably another tactical mistake I made. Atthat point, I would have borrowed the money to get out there or maybe visited a7-11 with my persuader… but I just figured that ship had sailed.I couldn’t bring myself toeven watch the movie when it first came out. Didn’t see it until some yearslater when it was on TV.I’m not sure what role Malihad in mind for me. She’d just said “one of the guard’s roles,” so I have noidea what she had in mind. I hope it was the guy who didn’t put the sponge inthe water. I’d hate to think it was one of the good guy roles…Lost opportunities… I’vehad a few. That was a pretty big one.How about you guys? Anymissed opportunities at fame and fortune you’ve had you’d like to share? Miseryloves company, y’know…Blue skies,LesP.S. Jodi, if you’rereading this, tell me why you didn’t just slap me up alongside the head?Metaphorically, that is…"},

{"title": "CENSORSHIP", "date": "Tuesday, December 24, 2013", "text": "Hi folks,I'm going to repost a lecture I delivered for my MFA graduation back in the nineties today. The reason I am is because I feel it's one of the most important issues facing us today--censorship, as is provided by what I feel is the most insidious methods of denying people their right of free speech in the form of that moronic crap called \"Political correctedness.\" It's my personal belief that this is the biggest single threat to our freedom than anything else... although there are quite a few contenders jockeying for that #1 position. I just wanted to post something that might be food for thought as we near the beginning of the new year. Be forewarned--it's long!(This essay is included in my story collection, GUMBO YA-YA from Snubnose Press.) CENSORSHIP AND WHY I LOVE CHARLESBUKOWSKIByLes Edgerton(LectureDelivered to MFA in Writing Students & Faculty at Vermont College, January8, 1997. Later published in Circle KMagazine.)            Like most of you in this room, I’vealways written, always had to write. I had this thing inside me that said I hadto be a writer. Notice, I said had tobe. Not “wanted” or “yearned to be”. Hadto be. There was no choice in the matter. God looked down and saw thislittle runty red thing laying in his bassinet, sucking down a PBR with aformula chaser, and He said, “I need another writer for my Grand Scheme,” andBingo! There I was. A writer. When God Himself says you’re gonna be a writer,then, boy, you better be a writer. You play the hand you’re dealt.            I didn’t have any argument withthat. I mean, who argues with God? Except, maybe Francois Camoin. But I didn’thave the advantage of being French and cynical and all that like Francois did-I didn’t even know where to begin to buy a beret or a black painter’s smock oran attitude. I mean, for Christ’s sake, I was a kid in Texas. None of those things could be gottenin Texas. Ifyou couldn’t barbecue it or shoot it, fuck it or ride it, forget it. Notavailable west of the Pecos.            So I had to be a writer who grew upin Texas andmy opportunities were pretty limited because of that.            Unfortunately, I was the product ofa traditional American education. I say “unfortunately” because the literatureI was exposed to in that system included what might be termed “safe” writers.Thackery, Milton, Shakespeare, Melville, Whitman, Steinbeck, Faulkner...youknow the list. It’s the list we’ve all been exposed to.            I tried. Believe me, I tried. But mymodels for writing were all wrong, in a way. They were guys like Balzac andDickens, Henry James and Jonathon Swift. Ladies like Louisa May Alcott. Greatwriters, sure, but from another planet as far as I was concerned. I grew up ina bar, saw my first man killed when I was twelve - shot six feet in front ofme. I was the night dispatcher for my grandmother’s cab company when thathappened and had to phone the police. Nothing like that ever happened in Little Women, near as I could tell.            One by one, I tried all the genresand styles I became exposed to and one thing or the other doomed eachexperiment. I mean, I loved the books I read and of course I tried imitatingthem in style and content, but even though they were wonderful books, theyweren’t about worlds I inhabited. I guess I assumed you weren’t allowed towrite about the planet I happened to find myself on.            I just didn’t realize you wereallowed to write about real life, at least life as I knew it. It was my firstbrush with censorship, although I didn’t know it. Our local public library,which was my only source of reading material just didn’t carry anything in thecontemporary realism category. Looking back, I know now the head librarianhauncho probably felt those kinds of books would damage my tender anddeveloping character, so even if they had such books on their shelves, theywere kept from youngsters like myself.            So, for years, I continued writingwhat I thought was the only kind of stuff that could get published and littleby little became more and more disillusioned with writing and literature ingeneral. Perhaps if I had gone to college at an earlier age, I might havediscovered there were books out there to which I could relate, but I didn’t. Iwas in the Navy and then in prison, and in those kinds of environments you justdon’t run across literature that’s much different than what you’d find on youraverage high school English recommended reading list.            I quit writing for a number ofyears, because, frankly, I was bored. It was by chance only that I came upon awriter who relit the literary fires.            Charles Bukowski.            Wow.            Lights went off.            This guy was doing things I didn’tknow you were allowed to do. He was writing about life, about real life.Nitty-gritty, down and dirty life. Lots of it was funny, most of it was sad,but it all touched me, way down deep there in that literary G-spot all writers(and readers) are forever trying to connect with.            I read another guy about the sametime that turned me on fire inside as well. Kurt Vonnegut. I read thisinterview in the Paris Review inwhich he said, “Literature should not disappear up its own asshole, so tospeak.” Big spark of understanding there. Ol’ Kurt said exactly what I had beenunable to articulate for a long time, ever since I started reading the“masters.” The old boys (and girls) had some good stuff going for them, but itseems like literary sphincterism had set in by the time I came along, all thesedeified contemporary writers were sitting around contemplating their ownnavels, it seemed. I was reading all this stuff about upper-middle class angst.Really jazzy stuff, like how some guy was sorrowing because all he had out oflife was his Chrysler agency and ten million bucks and was searching his souland was in this big blue funk because he hadn’t gone off with Easy Sally thattime at the senior prom way back in H.S. Every book I picked up at that periodseemed to have a similar theme. I just couldn’t identify. Hell, I never wasable to afford a used Chrysler, letalone an entire agency, and I had runoff with Easy Sally--yeah, I was that guy, the one in the leather jacket andthe slicked-back hair--really! I had hair, back then--and believe me thereisn’t a lot of angst to be used for material in the writing trade when you’resitting in the trailer and Easy Sally is looking like Even Easier Sally and youdon’t know where your next PBR is coming from and the TV is flashing thoselittle tornado warnings across the bottom of the screen and you’re trying toquiet the little rascal on your knee that has your last name but the propanedelivery man’s hook nose. I just knewsomewhere deep inside my bones I couldn’t fake writing a whole, entire book outof what it meant to be the Executive Vice President in Charge of Sales forSoutheastern Florida for the Tidy Bowl Corp and sorrowing over the lost babe ofhis childhood or the sad fact that he’d chucked it all and gone off to paintTahitian sunsets. Or that his wife had. Crap like that.            All of a sudden, here’s this guyBukowski writing about shit I knewabout. About whores and hustlers, winos and fathead bosses who were alwaysworried their wives would go to bed with the help so they got their mad out inthe open right away.            I picked up a book of his, acollection of stories called “The Most Beautiful Woman in Town and OtherStories.” I loved those other stories. It was like sitting down with a homeboyor your rap partner in the joint and swapping lies. Better yet; it was entertaining. All of a sudden, Iremembered why I had first started writing. To make someone laugh. Or cry.Learn something about another human being. Just feel something. Feel what I was feeling. Here was this guy,Bukowski, and he was doing exactly what I’d always wanted to do.            Bukowski’s stories weren’t aboutmiddle-aged English professors who were all in a fret because their wives nolonger get excited sitting around listening to them conjugate French verbs anddeducing that their lives, the meaningful portions of them, anyway, were over.Some of these guys, it seemed, took 400 pages to figure out why the major babein their life was leaving. They were bored,Jack.*                                                          *                                                          *            I know this was billed as a lectureon censorship and you may be wondering where the censorship angle comes in.Well, where it comes in is that not only were folks like Bukowski not beingpublished by so-called “respectable” presses in this country, but other booksby writers like him were not generally available to people like myself. Theyweren’t talked about by our English teachers, they weren’t on the shelves ofour hometown libraries--or if they were, they were kept from our view andknowledge. In other words, there was a form of censorship operating that keptthis kind of book from me and others that exists today and it is this and otherforms of censorship, overt and covert, that I’ll get to, by and by. I want toshow what it is about Bukowski that turned my whole life around. Well, not my life--I mean, I still have to mow thegrass on Saturday and take out the garbage--but this story saved my writing life, which is, after all, theonly life worth having.            The story was The Fiend. You may have read it. If you did, you either became afan of Bukowski’s or you hated his guts. Personally, I became a fan.            Basically, it’s a story about amiddle-aged guy named Martin Blanchard, who’s been defeated by alcohol. He’slost his wife and family, two wives, twofamilies, actually, his job, everything.Twenty-seven jobs he’s gone through. That’s a lot of jobs. This guy’s justyour basic average slob who can’t leave the juice alone. He’s reduced to livingin this squalid apartment, four flights up, and drinking wine. His only sourceof income is his unemployment checks and money left in parking meters. Badlyeducated, yet he listens to classical music, preferring Mahler.            He begins to notice this little girloutside playing. He begins to notice she has on these interestingpanties...and... you guessed it, he finds himself masturbating. Afterwards, hefeels relief. It’s out of my mind, hethinks after he gets off. I’m free again.Only, he’s not. It’s just the beginning of a new obsession, a perversion. Forthe first time in months, perhaps years, he has an interest. It repels him, buthe can’t resist it, either.            At first, he thinks it’s justsomething weird that overtook him and now it’s out of his system, but after hedrinks his last bottle of wine, he sees the little girl outside in the streetand begins to get hard again. He decides to go to the store to replenish hiswine supply and as he walks outside he notices the little girl and the twolittle boys have gone into the garage across the street. He finds himselfwalking into the garage behind them and shutting the doors.            He then proceeds to rape thelittle girl, in very graphic detail. When you read this part, if it doesn’tmake you sick, you’re probably beyond the kind of help counseling can give youat this late date. All the while he’s committing this heinous act, the two boysare asking him questions. They express genuine curiosity and don’t seem to beoverly-frightened, exhibiting more of an amoral attitude than anything.Bukowski does something quite skillful here. Instead of having the two youngboys be scared shitless, he shows them to be mainly curious about what Martinis doing to their friend. These kids are witnessing something pretty horrible,but then they’re just kids, and there’s an amoral innocence about theirreaction that blurs the morality. Raping a child is without doubt a trulyhorrible crime, with no redemption in such an act, but since it’s hard towholeheartedly condemn the two boys the reader is moved into an area of moralambiguity that creates a kind of complicity with the boys. The reader thenbecomes, like the boys, a kind of voyeur to Martin’s act. This also helpshumanize the monster Martin is, inasmuch as any such person could be seen ashaving human qualities.            The kicker for me in this story wasa line a little earlier on in the story, as Martin is kissing the child, justbefore he rapes her, and the narrator says, “Martin’s eyes looked into her eyes and it was a communication betweentwo hells--one hers, the other his.” When I read this line, it was as ifI’d been struck by literary lightening.            What I have always thought goodwriting was about was people, allkinds of folks, and what made writing about people good, was that it showed you something about them. Something youdidn’t know or were confused on or were ignorant of. And not just politicallycorrect folks, either. In fact, preferably notpolitically correct folks. Is there a more boring bunch in the SolarSystem? You see, I was in jail, I was an alcoholic, I was a drug user, I wasall those kinds of dudes that aren’t allowed to buy a house in WestchesterCounty--well, that’s not right, exactly, according to my New York friends, mostof the citizens in Westchester fitthat description--but you know what I mean--and I knew they weren’t all weak orstupid or worthless. They didn’t all start out that way. Something happenedalong the road. Some of the most intellectual conversations I’ve ever heardwere in soup kitchens. I met a guy once who used to teach physics at M.I.T.,one fine Thanksgiving Day at the free turkey blowout the Salvation Army washosting in Baltimore.This guy could make hydrogen bombs in his sleep and probably cure cancer if hegot a year off the sauce.            Anyway, back to Bukowski and hisstory about the child rapist. Bukowski doesn’t excuse this motherfucker, normake him out to be anything but the monster he is, but he does show ussomething about the guy which we probably wouldn’t have known in any other way.He shows us there’s a human being running around inside the guy someplace. Asomewhat troubled human being, butone of us at any rate. And this is what literature should be all about. Showingus to one another. The good, the bad, the ugly as well as the downrightperverts.            All his stuff isn’t good. In fact, alot of it stinks. Kind of masturbation-on-the-page type of stuff. He considershimself a genius--well, he is,actually--and Bukowski seems to have thought that everything he had a thoughton was important because it came out of his brain. Not true. That virtuallyeverything he wrote got printed may not have been his fault, but more the faultof publishers who bought into his self-created myth.            Almost any other writer that thissame story would have occurred to, would have taken the point of view of anyonebut Martin’s. The little girlherself, the boys, the cops who came and arrested him, the parents. An adultwho discovered the crime. A fly on the wall. To write this kind of story fromthe pov of the perp, in my mind, is the stuff of literary courage. It’s verydangerous stuff. It you don’t bring it off, it almost makes the writer appearas if he excused Martin for what he’s done, which would have made Bukowski aneven bigger monster than his character. What he’s been able to do is presentMartin exactly as he is - a hideous member of the human race...but amazingly,yet...still a member of humanity.It’s interesting in one respect, too, in that Bukowski wrote this story in thethird person, while most of his other writing is first person and confessionalautobiography. It looks as if he wanted to make sure readers didn’t confuse thenarrator with the author, which, if he did, renders him just a little lesscourageous. I don’t want to think of him that way, so I’ll give him the benefitof the doubt.            With that one little sentence, “Martin’s eyes looked into her eyes and itwas a communication between two hells--one hers, the other his.” Bukowskigives us an insight that is deeply profound. And that, in my opinion, is whatgreat writing is all about.            It takes enormous courage to be ableto write about the kinds of people Bukowski does. Readers, even intelligentreaders, tend to associate the writer with the narrator. In my first semester,I wrote a story about a character who was a criminal, and I had the concernthat the reader of the piece would want to know if I had been a criminalmyself. I addressed my concern to my first advisor here, Phyllis Barber, andshe said, “an intelligent reader will never ask if a piece of writing isautobiographical, so don’t worry about it.” Well, Phyllis meant well, and in aperfect world, this would be true, but believe me, even very intelligentreaders at least wonder if the stuff they’re reading comes from the writer’sown experience and even the brightest of readers will wonder if very negativeor dark stuff is what the author really thinks and feels. It’s just humannature. It’d be nice if readers accepted work labeled as fiction as justthat--fiction--but the truth of the matter is, there’s something of theprurient in all of us that makes us hope that the stuff on the page--especially the dark, forbidden stuff--isderived from the real experience of its creator. It gives most of us adelicious little shiver of horror to be standing this close to depravitywithout actually having to get any of it on ourselves. There is some part ofalmost all our souls that craves the darker side of life. We are alternatelytitillated and repulsed by immoral behavior and I think that is the reasonbooks and stories and movies about bad guys are so well-attended. We cansatisfy this baser part of our souls in a safe and acceptable manner, so longas they get put in their places in the end.            Most of my own writing output hasbeen about such people, and without exception, those who read it and areacquainted with me, will come up and ask, in almost an embarrassed fashion,“Was that yourself you were writing about?” Up until just recently, I wouldusually answer that, uh, no, I just knowsome people like that. I’ve usually taken the coward’s way out. Just recently,I’ve begun to admit that, yes, I’ve done many of the things that show up in mystories. I’ve been a criminal, done time, sold drugs, been involved in varioussexual aberrations, broken many and diverse laws. I don’t do them anymore--well, not as many--I’d be roomtemperature by now if I’d continued doing some of the things I used to. And,I’m a different person than I was when I was involved in those things. That’swhy I’ve usually lied when asked if the author of my work was the same as thenarrator. Most folks, no matter what they say, will assume you’re still thatkind of person and that kind of reputation will keep you from getting some ofthe nicer rewards of our civilization.            The thing that writers like Bukowskirepresent to me is truth. As a groupof animals endowed with a superior intellect--as compared with, say, monkeys ortse-flies--and if we do indeed have this intelligence, then what we ought to beabout primarily is the pursuit of truth. This is what education should beabout, although sadly, it seems not to be the Holy Grail it once was. Back in“my day” which was the nineteen-sixties, that’s what a lot of us wereinterested in. Truth. We were into toppling institutions. Institutions we feltwere based on lies. And, I guess that’s why writers like Bukowski appeal to meso much. The one thing we weren’t being in the sixties was safe. Although, that’s not entirely true. There was a largecontingent of folks that were concerned mainly with making sure they didn’t goto Vietnamand get shot at. A lot of the hyperbole in that era was, in fact, centeredaround changing a system that could put one’s physical unit in jeopardy. Butfor many of us, especially those of us who had been in the military at the time,the things we were involved in were anything but safe. That’s what seems to bemissing today. Most of the stuff I pick up and read, while quite good in manyinstances, is for the most part, safewriting. The mood has changed, as it always does, but the direction it hasmoved to is a dangerous one.            I’m speaking here of the phenomenonsweeping through this country referred to as being “politically correct.” Likemany grandiose ideas, there is a noble intent at the center of this outlook,but also like many other popular notions, it has been perverted until it is theantithesis of what it originated as. Being PC nowadays amounts to out and outcensorship in my opinion. For every writer like Bukowski, William Vollmann, andDavid Sedaris who breaks through and becomes a cult hero, there are hundreds ofwriters who are being stifled, vilified, and destroyed, simply because they donot preach the party’s message nor do they conform to the parameters set up bythe PC folks who seem to be in charge. Too often they are stifling themselvesby trying to placate society. What used to be considered simply bad tastenowadays takes on a more sinister connotation and that is dangerous if we valuefreedom of thought and value the time-honored tradition of the debate of ideaswhich is the only viable method for advancing knowledge and understanding.            Plato himself spoke about politicalcorrectness in The Republic, when hesaid:            “Then the first thing will be toestablish a censorship of the writers of fiction, and let the censors receiveany tale of fiction which is good, and reject the bad; and we will desiremothers and nurses to tell their children the authorized ones only.” How aboutthat.            In another of Bukowski’s stories, 3 Chickens, he continually beats hisgirlfriend. Definitely not a PCstory. Here are some direct quotes from the story:            onceshe was screaming these insanities from the fold-down bed in our apartment. Ibegged her to stop, but she wouldn’t. finally, I just walked over, lifted upthe bed with her in it and folded everything into the wall.            thenI went over and sat down and listened to her scream.            butshe kept screaming so I walked over and pulled the bed out of the wall againthere she lay, holding her arm, claiming it was broken.and            now,another time she angered me and I slapped her but it was across the mouth andit broke her false teeth.            Iwas surprised that it broke her false teeth and I went out and got this supercement glue and I glued her teeth together for her. it worked for awhile andthen one night as she sat there drinking her wine she suddenly had a mouthfulof broken teeth.            thewine was so strong it undid the glue. it was disgusting. we had to get her somenew teeth, how we did it, I don’t quite remember, but she claimed they made herlook like a horse.and            thebar was full, every seat taken. I lifted my hand. I swung. I backhanded her offthat god damned stool. she fell to the floor and screamed.            There are more abusive incidents inthe story. This is horrible stuff to anyone--and I imagine that’s most ofus--who is interested in consciousness-raising about spouse abuse andbattering--but there is a value to being exposed to this kind of material. Howelse can we understand anything about violence unless we observe and portray itaccurately? It exists, just as surely as serial killers exist, and how can onecombat evil unless one understands its nature?            Gordon Weaver, who was on thefaculty here at Vermont until a few years ago, told me in an interview, that,“If our special interest, as writers and/or editors, is the precise use oflanguage toward the end of a viable perception of and effect on reality, we mayargue there is some virtue implicit in anyutterance (written or oral) that confronts the consensus of any gathering.”He gives an example. “There is a cost that will be paid by all concerned if onetells a Polack joke in the presence of Poles, but I contend the cost is greaterif one stifles or sanitizes the anecdote.” Gordon has something here, I think.Weaver also told me that academicians are perhaps the newest bullies on thecensorship block and perhaps the most dangerous of all. He stated that, “Thereis a greater danger, it seems to me, when the censors come from the ranks ofthe presumably ‘enlightened’. It is not surprising that a number of college anduniversity communities nurture factions who wish to control free speech; it isunsettling when more sophisticated citizens (faculty) add their clout tomovements desiring to police our utterance in the interests of what minority oranother deems politically incorrect.”            Whether or not you agree withwriters like Bukowski, or Weaver for that matter, is unimportant. What isimportant is that they and others of diverse opinions have a forum to be heardand read. That forum is disintegrating under the onslaught of those who wish tostifle speech that disagrees with theirs. Truth is in danger of beingextinguished, and it may fall to us who write to be the last vanguard of freespeech. That is why writers such as Bukowski need to be published and need tobe read by establishment presses and before they’re dead. There are some of uswho feel we are plunging back into a Dark Age. History would confirm that to beso. After nearly every period of enlightenment, anarchy prevails again forawhile, and this is what I see us heading toward, as a nation and as a world.            It is the nature of groups to wantto stifle opposing viewpoints. In this country, supposedly the land of freespeech, attempts at suppression have been with us since the adoption of theFirst Amendment, but the preponderance of that type of activity has beentraditionally borne by extremists of the far right and far left political andsocietal spectrum. Those with the hot fire of righteousness in their bellieshave been the usual standard-bearers for the termination of ideas contrary totheir agenda and such should probably be expected.            Gordon Weaver told me that althoughhe dislikes boorish and bigoted expressions, he sees a greater danger indisallowing their spokesmen an opportunity to be heard.            “The censors will always be withus,” he said. “It is the nature of both institutions and individuals to desirethe silence of those they wish to suppress. Institutions with political poweror ambitions for same (government, churches, schools) can probably be fendedoff--as they have been in modern times at least--by organized responses. TheAmerican Civil Liberties Union has a pretty good record in this regard. Simplecrackpots (racists, militant feminists, and other self-appointed arbiters ofcommunity morality) seem to wither away if studiously ignored.”            Repression comes in many forms, notalways overt. Kathleen M. Sullivan, a professor of law at Harvard Law School,in talking about the censorship issue as it affects funding for the NEA, saysof the PC issue, “An artist who receives a check in the mail (from the NEA)with a ‘hit list’ of forbidden ideas attached will forego too much valuable andinnovative expression for fear it will come too close to the line. As (USSupreme Court) Justice Thurgood Marshall once put it, the problem with a ‘swordof Damocles is that it hangs--notthat it drops.’”            Fred Grandy, former actor on the Love Boat and now a Congressman from Iowa, says, “I am noartist and have 10 years on TV to prove it. But I have spent enough of my lifearound creative minds to know that you cannot have art without risk. You cannotwrite language proscribing the human imagination that will not turn artistsaway in droves.”            Speaking of Congress in terms thatcould be applied to college professors and publishers as well, Grandy said,“Trying to eliminate smut by allowing Congress to tell America what isand is not artistic is as misguided as attempting to legislate patriotism byamending the Constitution to prohibit flag burning.”            And publishers. How do they, asdeciders of what news is fit to print, view the censorship debate? Reactionsrange from the moderately perplexed to the horrified doomsayers.            Robert McDowell, who publishes theStory Line Press, wrote an opinion piece for the Register-Guard in Eugene, Oregon,which perhaps synopsizes the publisher’s view. “The debate pits a democraticmajority believing in our First Amendment rights of free speech against awell-financed and well-organized minority extolling the virtues of all that iswholesome and the government’s right to control the subject matter of the bookswe read, the music we enjoy, the paintings and plays we experience.” McDowellcalls Senator Jesse Helms and other individuals and groups’ efforts to censor materialsfunded by the NEA, “the most severe legalized censorship in this country sincethe McCarthy era,” and labels such censorship efforts as being “shamefulattacks on free speech and the artist’s right to represent the truth as he orshe perceives it.”            Pulitzer-Prize-winning novelist,Larry McMurtry, in a Washington Post article, accused the Jesse Helms-ledforces of attempting to “eliminate all sex from American art if they can.Rembrandt’s sketch of a fully clothed heterosexual couple attempting the missionaryposition behind a bush would likely not be thought fund-worthy by Helms, whosestated preferences would limit us to snow scenes, pictures of bird dogs orromantic landscapes involving, if possible, humble tobacco farms.” McMurtrygoes on, “The narrative as these individuals see it, in their determination totell Americans what they need and don’t need in the way of publicly funded art,is rigidly chaste: no public money for anything with sex in it! (They may claimthat (they) only want to withhold public money from art that depicts ordescribes ‘wrong’ sex-- i.e., homeoerotic (no grants to Leonardo or Proust!)sadomasochistic (no Westerns, no film noir), exploitive of children (no Lolita,no Lewis Carroll), but it’s clear that they really mean to eliminate all sexfrom American art if they can.”            Kathleen Sullivan puts it even moresuccinctly, when she says, “A free society can have no official orthodoxy inart any more than in religion or politics. And in a free society, suchorthodoxy can no more be purchased by power of the purse than compelled bypower of the sword.”            Just a couple of years ago, StanleyBanks, Kansas Cityplaywright and poet, offered the balance of such cost: “We will begin to seedull art which has no freshness of vision. Certain points of view will besilenced. When that happens our society will be seriously threatened without abomb being blasted.” He warns us not to “call for laws to censor artists whochallenge our consciousness in ways that might be uncomfortable, irritating,risqué, etc. For those who don’t want to see or hear or read about acts orpoints of view contrary to their own, he advises, “simply don’t look, buy it orlet the kids have access to it!”            Banks’ “dull art which has nofreshness of vision” is already upon us. It has always been with us, sincecensorship in one form or another has always been around--it has only increasedmightily in the past few years. The result is art which is becoming blander andblander, much resembling the “art” that was allowed to surface in totalitariangovernments such as the USSRof a few years past and in many other governments. America is not yet at that stage,but if current developments continue in publishing, in the university, and ingovernment, we are not far from achieving total censorship, imposed by thegroup in control.            What scares me the most is thatuniversities should be the bastion of free thought but the state of the matteris that free debate of ideas is rapidly disappearing from the college campus.As more and more writers come out of university settings and are beinginfluenced by teachers with a decided political bent, the writing they producebecomes more and more insipid. These same writers take over the litmags andeditor positions at publishing houses and impose their political beliefs onthose who submit, publishing only those that can pass the PC test in thecontent of their creative material. As Kurt Vonnegut said in a quote citedearlier, “Literature should not disappear up its own asshole, so to speak.”Well, it’s in great danger of doing just that. It’s about halfway up the anus.            In interviewing folks for an articleI wrote on censorship for Circle KMagazine, I was referred to the brother-in-law of a friend of mine, anAustralian, who was teaching physics and doing research at one of America’sleading universities which I cannot name because I’ve promised him anonymity.This man says, “I think it’s a myth that censorship doesn’t exist on collegecampuses. I believe universities should be places where anybody can saywhatever they want and everybody should be very tolerant, but it’s just nottrue. Students are punished for saying certain things. You could say whateveryou wanted at the University of Sydney (where he’sfrom). They were much more tolerant there. In student publications there wasmuch less concern about libel, for example. The litigation aspect puts a lot ofpressure on what ideas you can express.” This man only agreed to give me hisviews when I swore several times I wouldn’t use his name or even tell whatuniversity he was at, for fear of losing his job. It’s a sad day when a personfrom another country is allowed a greater freedom of expression there than inhis adopted country which professes to be the freest nation on earth.            This professor went on to say, “Ithink there’s more of a tradition in European-style universities for freedom ofspeech--that that’s what universities are for. In America, the impression I get isthat universities are for other purposes...for training professionals and forfootball games. It’s not about intellectual freedom. You pay us (educators)your money and you want something at the end. You want a guaranteed elite jobin society, and it has nothing to do with expanding your mind. You’re buying aproduct. It’s more of a consumer orientation.”            He adds, “The government is tryingto censor more and more science that they are actually paying for. For example,on sensitive subjects as global warming, the government wants to see researchresults first, because of the possible political consequences.”            Americans should be ashamed whenthey have prided themselves on theirs being the leading example of a freesociety, when others in the world community may be seeing us very differently,as evidenced by my anonymous critic and source.            Anita Manning, writing for USAToday, says that the issue is different in colleges than it is in the lowerlevels of education.            “In K through 12, there is a schoolboard or some sort of governing body that chooses what books are included in thecurriculum...whereas in the college setting, the individual professor orinstructor chooses the books for that course and students choose whether or notto take the course, leading to entire different issues.”            In June, 1992, Brenda Suderman,acting media relations officer for The Bulletin, the student newspaper at the University of Manitoba in Winnipeg, reported that the universitydeleted about 170 files containing material on sexual bondage and pornographyfrom the Internet computer system the university subscribes to. Gerry Miller,Director of Computer Services, made the decision in consultation with TerryFalconer, Vice-President (administration), saying the material was removedbecause “we felt they (the deleted files) didn’t support the mission of theuniversity and we felt they were objectionable.”            Alisa Smith, co-editor of TheMarlet, the student newspaper at the University of Victoria in British Columbia,published what university officials deemed objectionable material as exampledby a lesbian, gay, bisexual issue put out in 1991 which featured male andfemale genitalia on the cover. About 2,000 copies were thrown into dumpsters bycampus traffic and security functionaries upon administrative order. Even so,Smith feels the press is becoming a bit freer. (Yeah, well--go figure…)            She says, “The mainstream media iscovering a lot of issues that only the alternative press used to cover. Isuppose the backlash against political correctness is sort of an attemptedcensorship, like trying to silence people, but not by directly shutting downtheir newspapers. (Universities) are trying to shut down thought, rather than newspapers. All the articles that you see areabout how PC’s have sort of gotten a grip on society and how people can’t saywhat they want anymore. I guess it’s like a left-wing phenomenon.”            Let money talk, though, andcensorship takes on yet another clever form: the economic kind.            “Personally,” says Smith, “I thinkthe biggest form of censorship right now is the fact that the economy is sobad, making advertising really hard to come by. A lot of papers used to have afairly idealistic boycott list for advertising that they wouldn’t use becauseof things those advertisers were funding--like nuclear systems contracting orbecause they were pro-apartheid in South Africa. Editors are findingthey can’t make ideological choices any more because of monetary pressure. Ifyou’re really dependent on advertising dollars, you have to basically write thekinds of things that won’t offend your advertisers and don’t disagree withtheir stances.”            This latter statement seems tocontrast with her earlier one that “the press is becoming a bit freer,” and isperhaps a good example of why censorship is unnecessary. If you allow anyone totalk freely long enough, they may provide sufficient evidence by their ownwords that they should not be taken that seriously when giving us the benefitof their opinion.            Fearful of bad publicity duringstressful economic times, it is not so surprising college and universityadministrations are increasingly acting to suppress anything that might bringadverse publicity to their campuses. What is surprising is that faculty membersare increasingly joining in, even in the supercharged Politically Correctenvironment that has permeated most higher-education campuses in one way oranother.            A 1992 incident at Nicholls State University in Thibodaux, Louisiana,exemplifies the debate and poses difficult and perplexing arguments for bothsides of the issue.            A cartoon ran in the studentnewspaper, the Nicholls Worth, poking fun at three black singers in a rap groupthat had performed on campus. Black students who were offended, protested byburning about 150 copies of the paper publicly. Their complaint was that theywere greatly upset by the exaggerated features of the cartoon figures and thestereotypes it reinforced. Eric Knott, president of a black fraternity deniedthat the protest had anything to do with being politically correct.            “I’m not one to hide behind racismand claim that everything in society is racist, (but) the cartoon clearlydegraded the black race,” Knott says.            Marty Authement, student editor ofthe paper, said that he “used poor judgment” in allowing the cartoon to bepublished, but was also concerned that “political correctness is limiting whatjournalists can do. These days you have to be more sensitive than you usuallywould be. If you live by the strict law of political correctness, there’s notmuch left.”            I had a very jarring and dismayingexperience with PCism with my own novel TheDeath of Tarpons. A few years before it actually got published, a regionalpublisher in the Southwest wanted to buy it. A very few months before thisoffer, I was sleeping on a garage floor in California and eating out of a Bob’sBig Boy dumpster, so the money he offered had the same value as a milliondollars to me. I almost signed the contract until the publisher said, “Well, wehave to change a lot of this. There’s stuff in here that might make certainfolks upset.” He gave as an example a scene in which the boy’s father whips himwith a live king snake. This might offend the snake lovers, he said. That’s gotto be what?--seven or eight in the U.S.A.? Not counting, of course,the folks who use them in church services. He cited about twenty other scenesI’d have to change because they might offend this person or that. Reluctantly,I withdrew the book, not knowing if it would ever be published, and indeed, itwas another five years before I found a publisher who wasn’t as concerned aboutsnake lovers’ feelings and was more concerned with putting out a book that shefelt had literary value.            Mind you, this was several yearsbefore the wholesale PC attitude took over the country. This asshole--and I don’t excuse myself from the term--wasmerely the forerunner of what is a terrifying fact of life today.            If you believe this to be theravings of a paranoid mind, consider these facts:            A record 348 incidents of attemptedcensorship occurred in the 1991-92 school year, according to The American Way,a liberal watchdog group. That’s an increase of 20% over the previous high, afigure they claim poses an alarming advance in assaults on a basicConstitutional right--a right almost universally assured in most of the freeworld.            The Literary Network, a projectjointly administered by Poets&Writers, Inc. and the Council of LiteraryMagazines and Presses report over 6,000 attempts to remove books from shelvesin American libraries in the 1980’s and ‘the number of incidents is noticeablyon the rise.”            Concerned Women for America, aconservative, pro-family group asserts all censorship attempts are notnecessarily bad. Caia Mockaitis, speaking for the organization, says the issueis one of selection, not censorship, many times, in that “there are somematerials that are appropriate for kids and some that are not,” no matter whatadults’ political bias, liberal or conservative.            Mockaitis has plenty of like-mindedsupporters. Censorship attempts at banning outright or restricting access tobooks and magazines in secondary school libraries were successful in nearlyone-half of instances between 1987 and 1990, reports a University of Wisconsinsurvey of 6,600 schools. Challenged publications were removed 26 percent of thetime, restricted by age or grade level 22 percent of the time, and more likelyto occur at small schools.            The book challenged most? JudyBlume’s Forever, a story of a teenagegirl who loses her virginity. Sports Illustrated’s swimsuit issue and RollingStone were the most-challenged magazines at secondary schools, according to USAToday, Jan. 20, 1992.            Consider this item: “PornographyVictims Compensation Act” was a bill on the U.S. Senate floor that would enablevictims of sex crimes to file civil suits in an effort to recover damages fromproducers and distributors of obscene materials (including publishers,wholesalers, and booksellers) if the victims can show that the materials“caused” the crimes. This “third-party liability” bill is a way of imposingcensorship through a back door. This item was reported by the AmericanBooksellers Association.            Here’s another: In May, 1990, FerrisAlexander, operator of a chain of bookstores, theaters and video stores in the Minneapolis area, wasfound guilty of violating the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organization Act(RICO) obscenity forfeiture law. His crime? Selling four magazines and threevideotapes found to be obscene and valued at less than $200. Alexander wassentenced to six years in prison, fined $200,000 and forfeited a $25 million dollarbusiness. This was reported by The Media Coalition.            Here’s another. Three editors of theOhio State Universitystudent newspaper, The Lantern,resign when members of the journalism faculty issue a policy statement that thefaculty advisor had the authority to review articles for libel before they werepublished. This story from The Chronicleof Higher Education, March 4, 1992.            Censorship is everywhere and risingin attempts and more frightening, in successful attempts.            Free speech advocate Nat Hentoff,the author of Free Speech for Me - ButNot for Thee: How the American Left and Right Relentlessly Censor Each Otherfrom HarperCollins, feels that in too many cases, publishers, school boards andprincipals remove or change material for students rather than face the wrath ofmilitant parent groups. Seeing authorities suppress ideas in some cases, andbeing in a school in which books keep disappearing, gives a graphic lesson tostudents, Hentoff feels, in that they may have doubts that theirs is a countryof intellectual freedom.            And it appears it isspecial-interest groups that are behind these efforts and that the majority ofAmericans are against censorship. A survey conducted by Louis Harris for theAmerican Council for the Arts and sponsored by Phillip Morris Companies, Inc.,in February, 1992, polled 1,500 adults over the age of 18 by telephone. Part ofthe findings were that 91% felt it important for school children to be exposedto and participate in the arts; 67% felt learning about the arts as importantas learning about history and geography, 60% say as important as math andscience, and 53% believe the arts are important as learning to read and write.It’s evident that it’s a small but vocal and politically-powerful group ofminorities who are succeeding in censorship activities and these groups emergefrom both ends of the political and societal spectrum.            Virtually every publisher in thecountry, from the smallest litmag to the largest publishing conglomerate, isterrified of antagonizing any reader whatsoever, unless the person offended isnot part of a highly-organized, highly-vocal political group. This includesboth right and left-wingers. It seems everybody in America has now organized, has agroup with a slogan, a newsletter, a home page on the Internet, and a secrethandshake. The battle is being waged over who gets ultimate control of thepresses. And it doesn’t matter who wins. We all lose. What we lose is freedomof expression. And once that happens, we are done as a free society. I go toGordon Weaver once again, who said it as best as it can be said. “Censorshipfrom without is bad for the language, bad for those who speak or write it;self-imposed censorship, whatever themotive is worse. If you won’t say what you think, you run the risk of losingthe powers of both speech and thought. I suspect we’ll be safe just as long aswe refuse to accept censorship for anyone.”            Again, I quote Gordon Weaver forperhaps the best take on the situation. “If the king is naked, we’re all(including the king) better served if someone says so.”            Well, the king is indeed, naked. Theonly problem is not enough of us are saying so, preferring to remain safe, keepour jobs, get our material published and so we go on, giving silent tacitagreement to what is happening. This is an understandable position for many inour society; it is unforgivable for writers, at least in my opinion. Writersshould be like the canaries in coal mines, the warning system that things arenot right and that danger looms. As a group, we have many of us becomecomplacent, intent only on saving our professional selves at the expense offreedom of thought. Maybe we understand too well that although the canary inthe coal mine provided a valuable service, in doing so he ended up room temperature.            I cannot count the numbers ofinstances acquaintances of mine have said to me, “I cannot say certain things Ibelieve in, to my class, my teachers, my peers, or in my writing, because Iwould lose my job or be censured or not see my work in print, etc. What’s wrongwith us? What kinds of writers are we producing in this country that arefearful to take stands on issues they believe fervently about simply becausethey risk disapproval? What kind of chickenshit writer is it that the littlesquiggles he or she puts down on paper consist of half-truths and integritythat is compromised regularly? We are surrendering something precious more bywhat we don’t do than what we do. Are we so enamored of safety and comfort thatwe are willing to give up the freedom to express ourselves honestly? It seemsthat we are. It is a growing malaise that is sweeping the country and I holdthat the only ones that can stem the tide are the writers in our society. Butwhere are they?            Some are out there. There are a few.William Vollmann. Brian Everson. Michael Tolkin. Bukowski. There are othersthat we’ll never know of because they can’t find a forum. There need to be alot more such voices. What is really needed is for establishment forums tobegin looking more at the quality of the writing than the content. To give anear to voices that refuse to be influenced by a job, a smile from anempty-headed bureaucrat, publication in a white-bread magazine or by abottom-line mentality of a publishing conglomerate.            I think back to when I began writingas a grade school kid. One of the things I used to do was write humoroussketches of some of the more terrifying individuals I faced daily. Individualslike the bullies I and others faced, from the schoolyard rowdy to the teacherwho thought her job was to intimidate her class into submission. I’d show these“pieces” to friends, they’d be passed around, and in some cases, public opinionended those offenders’ bullying careers. Nobody likes to push someone around ifhe’s going to get laughed at by everyone else. It just plain takes all thepower out of it, not to mention the fun.            The problem today is, the bullieshave taken over not only the schoolyard, but the university, the Congress, andthe publishing house. Many of us in this room became writers because of a bullysomewhere in their past. Maybe it was another kid, or a group of kids, or maybeit was a parent or a teacher. We found we could effectively combat these kindsof folks by the written word. If we were physically weaker we possessed astrength that was virtually indefensible against. The power of ideas, expressedupon the page and in open debate. Do we want to give up our only weapon againsttyranny? I hope not.            And by the way--those writers Imentioned at the beginning of this lecture--Whitman, Steinbeck, Faulkner,Thackery, Milton, Shakespeare, Melville, Alcott--and that I described as“safe”, were anything but that when they were being published. They were almostall rogues in their time and were, by turns, either censored, vilified, viewedwith shock, attacked by those in power, or even unpublished in their lifetimesbecause of the content of their writing. It is only after many years had passedand the political climate had shifted, that the original perceptions of themand their work were considered nonthreatening enough to exist in our librariesand schools. Although many of them are still censored, even today. Steinbeckroutinely makes his appearance at book-burnings and other censorship attempts,along with Faulkner, Whitman and even Shakespeare. They were “safe” to me whenI read them, simply because I was reading them in a different, more removedera, but in fact, those writers who have become what we call “immortal” havelargely been the risk-takers of their time, who wrote in line with theirconscience, rather than the political and social mores of their period. Many ofthem endured great distress because what they were writing was politicallyincorrect at the time. The thing was, there were then and still are now,publishers who gave them a forum, often at great risk, and there were those whoread them, and so the world has been enriched through those individuals’courage. Knowing this, it would be easy to say, “well, hey, those folks gotpublished and there are those today being published who don’t parrot the partyline, so what’s the problem? The problem is, once we as writers and futureeditors and educators begin to think like that, complacency sets in and we getthe attitude to “let someone else worry about it” and that’s when our freedomof expression becomes seriously eroded and in danger of disappearing. Freedomof expression is a value that must be continuously fought for, over and over.That war is never finished unless one side or the other lays down its arms. Aspart of this generation of writers, it is our duty to take up the battle.            There is another point of view thatsays that it’s not the job of an artist to express a viewpoint or an opinion atall. While I respect the right of those who feel that way, I disagree. Indeed,is it possible to find a writer of note who hasn’t expressed his point-of-view,politically, through his or her writings? What else was Steinbeck commenting onin “The Grapes of Wrath” if not a political system? Perhaps he didn’t stand ona stump and proclaim to the world his political views but they sure are rightthere in his fiction. There are countless others I could give as examples andI’m sure you have your own list. Some artists feel it is their job to present avision of the world, not a political opinion. I don’t see a difference. Itseems to be a matter of semantics. What is a “vision of the world” except a political opinion? Or you mightcall such a view a “philosophy” but again, philosophies (in my opinion) arenothing but political ideologies dressed up in a tuxedo. I believe it all comesdown to politics and I mean politics in the purest sense, as in I want mine andyou want yours and I’d kill you for yours if we hadn’t agreed that we’recivilized and have figured out a way for both of us to keep our stuff and notworry about the other taking it. And, for me, that’s what censorship finallyboils down to. It’s refuting the principle that I can have mine and you can’ttake it and you can have yours and I can’t have it either. You can justsubstitute the word “opinion” for a particular possession. What I object to isthe closing down of forums for all but those who agree with the body politic,not in an overt way but by more subtle and insidious means.            Thank you for your time. I hope I’vegiven you some food for thought. I hope you’ll read some Charles Bukowski, someWilliam Vollmann. I don’t even care if you don’t like or agree with them. Infact, the only way this little talk will be a success if people go out of herearguing with each other. Personally, I’m like Robert Duvall in The Apocalypse Now - I love the smell ofa good argument in the morning. I’d like to leave you with one of my favoritequotes. In the preface to the infamous Storyof O, Jean Paulhan wrote, “Dangerous books are those that restore us to ournatural state of danger.”If you want to glom onto a politically incorrect book, may I suggest my own, THE RAPIST and/or THE BITCH? I'm pretty sure both fit the definition... Blue skies,Les"},

Liam Sweeny just posted a review of my forthcoming novel, THE BITCH, on his blog SPEAKEASY.Here's what Liam had to say:Liam Sweeny's Review: THE BITCH, by Les EdgertonI haven't posted in a while. Sorry... Holidays. Hard totype when you're plastered.Les Edgerton's \"The Bitch\" is about Jake Bishop, a two-time felonwith a Bitch dangling around his neck: Ha-BITCH-ual criminal, two strikesand one away from life without parole in Indiana's Correctional System. With anew business in the works, a loving wife and a baby on the way, Jake feels the glow of the sun, a chance to be a\"straight\" (law-abiding citizen).But then he gets the call from Walker Joy.Former cellmate and trusted inside-friend, Walker is out and back to tricks.He's in a bind, and Jake owes him. Walker's in with Sydney Spencer, ashady black market jeweler, and there's a \"piece of cake\" job thatJake is uniquely suited to do. But Jake's tasted the dawn, and as thedarkness begins to creep up at his heels he wants to run. Jake soon finds thatrunning's not as easy as it should be, and with the Bitch hanging over hishead, the night looms.There is so much to this book. It's the perspective. It's the sublime wisdomembedded in Jake's narration. It's the madness that you can taste as Edgertonguides you through twists and turns that stain the carpets and trunk liners.It's the little things that throw you because the story keeps you looking theother way. It makes Jake's descent real.Edgerton's style is dynamic, never giving you the time to get easy with thedrudgery of getting through some passage. I had to re-read a paragraph or twobecause I was still stunned by the one sentence that came before it. Yeah, it'sthat kind of book.Read it on a day off. Clear the day. Put on a pot of coffee. Trust me.I will recommend The Bitch to anyone who's capable of enjoying darkness, orjust a good book. I would also recommend this to anyone thinking of a life ofcrime.This is coming out in January. I will post the links once it does.Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year, everyone.Liam SweenyThank you so much, Liam. This really made my day!Blue skies,Les"},
{"title": "EARLY CHRISTMAS PRESENT!", "date": "Monday, December 16, 2013", "text": "Hi folks,Just got a couple of early Christmas presents! First, Frank Nowatzke, owner of the German press, Pulpmaster, just sent me the cover of THE RAPIST by artist 4000 and it's really cool. Can't show it yet as he wants to get up the preorder lists first.I also just signed and sent back the contract to Pulpmaster for my black comedy crime caper novel, THE GENUINE, IMITATION, PLASTIC KIDNAPPING. Frank has also entered it in the Berlinale, the companion film festival held in Europe along with the Frankfort Book Festival. He's hoping a studio along the lines of the Coen Brothers are there as he thinks that kind of studio would be perfect for it (I totally agree!).And then, for a couple of years Eric Campbell, the publisher of  Down and Out Books and I have been trying to get together for him to publish one of my books and we've reached an agreement to have him publish the aforementioned THE GENUINE, IMITATION, PLASTIC KIDNAPPING. I'm really happy with Eric running with this one. It's one of my favorite novels and I'm writing a sequel to it. It began life as a short story in The South Carolina Review and then I wrote the novel. And then I wrote a screenplay for it and it ended up as a Finalist in both the Writer's Guild and Best of Austin screenwriting competitions.Eric came up to me a couple of years ago in Cleveland at Bouchercon. Actually, he came to a Noir@TheBar function Eric Beetner had created and at which I was one of the readers. After my reading, he approached me and introduced himself and told me he'd been following my career and wanted to talk to me about placing one of my novels with them. What really impressed me about Eric--other than he was a super nice guy and actually bought copies of about four of my books I had with me--was that he was such a wonderful throwback to the old-time publishers in that he'd traveled to the convention with the purpose of scouting and contacting authors! Who does that nowadays? During our conversation, he said he'd had trouble hearing my reading (the sound system in the bar was horrific!), and that he could only make out about every other word, but that he was convinced he had to have me publish with him as even only hearing every other word was transfixing for him so he could tell from that it was powerful stuff. What writer doesn't like to hear things like that?!Then, I began to read his slate of authors and, just like Jon Bassoff of New Pulp Press, he'd assembled a truly fantastic group of writers.And then, the last great Christmas present is that Jon Bassoff contacted me to let me know that he'd already gotten an impressive list of reviewers for the January release of THE BITCH. The launch promises to be successful and I'm really stoked!I'm just so thankful for the support of guys like Jon and Eric. These are guys who not only know literature but do everything in their power to support authors.Hope you folks are getting great gifts like this this year also!Blue skies,LesComing in January from New Pulp Press in paperback and ebook formats.

The AUTHORNOMICS Series features literary agents, editors,authors, marketing experts and more talking about their opinions on thepublishing industry, writing, and what a writer needs to know.Interview with Author Les EdgertonLes Edgerton is an ex-con, matriculatingat Pendleton Reformatory for a couple of years in the sixties for burglary(plea-bargained down from multiple counts of burglary, armed robbery,strong-armed robbery and possession with intent). He’s since taken a vow ofpoverty (became a writer) with 14 books in print. 2011 was a good year for himas he published two novels with StoneGate Ink—Just Like That and ThePerfect Crime, along with noir novel The Bitch from Bare KnucklesPress, as well as a new short story collection, Gumbo Ya-Ya, fromSnubnose Press. He just sold his existential novella, The Rapist to NewPulp Press, which will be released in 2013. He is also editor-at-large for NoirNation International Crime Magazine. Work of his has been nominatedfor or won: the Pushcart Prize, O. Henry Award, Edgar Allan Poe Award (shortstory category), PEN/Faulkner Award, Texas Institute of Letters Jesse JonesBook Award, the Violet Crown Book Award, and others. He holds the MFA inWriting degree from Vermont College and a Certificate in Barbering fromPendleton Reformatory. He writes because he hates… a lot… and hard. Injusticeand bullying are what he hates the most.1.     As a prolific author with 14 books in print so far, can you elaborate on howthe publishing process has changed since your first book?It’schanged tremendously in some ways and barely at all in others. I’m old-school,so I don’t count self-publishing as publishing. A horse by any other name isstill a horse. In my opinion, it’s just another name for vanity publishing,which is not publishing but… printing (abeit in electronic form). I’m notincluding in that assessment legitimate publishers who publish ebooks, but I amincluding those who simply publish the work themselves. I have friends who’vechosen to self-publish and while they’re still my friends, I’m not going topurchase their books any more than I would the person who has stacks of theirvanity or subsidy-published books in their garage. Just want to define theterms. And, there are degrees and shadings within even the self-publishedcategory. For instance, I’m getting ready to self-publish a book… but it’s abook that has been published and done well. It just never came out in ebookform, so my agent got the ebook rights from the publisher and we’re going toput it out. That, to me, isn’t the kind of self-published “vanity” book I’mreferring to.Definitionsprovided, to answer your question, let me address what’s changed first. Thebiggest changes have come about because of the advent of ebooks.What’schanged is that if there was any doubt that mid-list authors have disappeared,now there’s no doubt. At one time, legacy publishers would publish a writer’sbooks knowing that they probably wouldn’t make any money on that particularbook, but they saw something in the writer that made them think that eventuallyan audience would build for that author and down the road, they’d all makemoney on his or her novels. As Roberto Durante said, in another context: “Nomas.”The BigSix, in particular, are almost exclusively interested in brand names. Provenwinners who have a sizable audience already in place. Here’s a prime example.A few months ago, I was told in confidence by someone who is in the “know,”that a top editor for a major publisher, who has his own imprint, was told byhis boss (yes, even top editors have bosses), that if he signed any novel thatdidn’t earn at least $30,000 he’d be fired. Not chastised, not given a talkingto, or a slap on the wrist, but… fired. Think this guy is going to wantto sign the brilliant novel by the unknown author or do you supposed he mightopt instead for the same-as-the-last book by Mr. Brand Name? Fugedaboutit. That’s one change.The secondchange I’ve observed is that so-called “literary novels” are just about over.Remember: I’m just the messenger. Don’t kill the messenger! Here’s how I knowthis. For almost thirty years, my wife and I and our son until he moved out ofthe house, visited a local bookstore every single week. Never missed a week.Our favorite was Borders and our second favorite was one of the two B&Noutlets. One Saturday, we walked into Borders and stood in shock at the change.The biggest single area the week before was the space devoted to what waslabeled “Mainstream fiction.” Mainstream encompasses literary fiction inbookstore terminology. They’d reduced that space fully by three-fourths. Thearea that used to house literary fiction and other fiction that didn’t fit aparticular genre was reassigned. To two areas. Genre fiction was one. The otherwas greeting cards, wrapping paper, novelty items. Cute little stuffed animals.I talked to the manager and she said she hated to do it, but all the Bordersstores were under corporate mandate to do the same. Literary and mainstreamfiction just weren’t selling. They couldn’t justify the space devoted to it, sothey reassigned it to genre fiction which was selling and significantly. It’s acold, hard fact, but the marketplace is what determines what’s selling topublishers. Literary novels today are infinitely tougher to sell than everbefore and that market is shrinking monthly. If you want to know what theliterary tastes of a nation are, simply gaze about at a national chain’s brickand mortar outlet and see what’s on the shelves. The category area that has themost shelf space is the area that’s selling.Does thismean so-called “literary” novels are impossible to get published? No; it justmeans it’s much harder. They’ll continue to get published because legacypublishers in this instance are the same as major film studios. Major filmstudios will put out 85 movies that appeal to the biggest audiencedemographic—teenaged boys—and the remaining 15 movies will be devoted to a mixof other kinds of films. Among those will be a couple of “artsy” movies. Theones that will be nominated for Golden Globes and Oscars. Most of which theyknow they’ll lose money on. Then why make em? Because, studios want to bethought of as intellectual, “arty” enterprises. Kind of an ego thing. They knowmost of what they produce is mindless schlock, but if they get an Oscar winneror even a nominee, they feel justified that they produce “art.” And, for theone movie that does get nominated or win, they’ll actually make money on itbecause of the publicity. It’s mostly a way for studio execs to feel good aboutthemselves and be able to delude themselves into thinking that they’re actuallyengaged in quality work. Makes ‘em walk tall when they walk into Spagos.Well,publishers do the same thing. For all the vampire novels selling in thebazillions, all the formulaic cartoonish novels about bigger-than-life vigilantesuperheroes, that maintain a healthy bottom line, they’ll all put out a fewliterary books that are published mostly because they’ll be up for the NationalBook Award, the Pulitzer, even the Nobel. For the same motivation as the filmstudios. So they can feel like they’re “literary” and providing “goodliterature.” Makes ‘em feel proud when they walk into the Russian Tea Room orElaine’s or wherever they gather these days.Am Icynical? You bet.What arethe things that have remained the same? Well, the legacy publishers stillemploy the best gatekeepers in the business. If you get published by a legacypublisher, you’ve achieved something. You’re truly validated by people whoactually know something about quality in writing. If you self-publish, your validationis going to come from your relatives, friends, and how effective you are atmarketing, for the most part. Sales seem to be the biggest factor in ebookpublishing and sales are a poor barometer of quality. For example, there is anauthor who was, at best, a mid-list author when he was being published bylegacy publishers—his work is truly mediocre, at best—who has become a hugemarketing success since he opted for self-publishing. He’s making lots ofmoney—and that’s fine—but his work is still godawful. If sales are your measureof success, he’s a good model to emulate. If being regarded as a good writer isyour measure, he’s probably not the guy whose bust you want gracing yourmantel. There’s a reason he went to self-publishing and it has to do withwriting ability. His sales ability is off the charts. His writing ability is…what’s the word?… oh, yeah… pure do-do.There areother changes and other things that remain the same, but those are some of thebiggest.2.You write novels, short fiction, nonfiction, and screenplays. What is yourfavorite genre to work in and why?Novels, byfar. They require the most creativity and the most ability. Short fiction wouldbe second. Nonfiction for the money. Screenplays are last. The reason is,screenplays aren’t about writing. No one picks up a screenplay to go sit in thehammock for a lazy-crazy afternoon of losing themselves in a fictional world.And, screenplays are ridiculously easy to write. I wrote my first screenplayliterally in two days. Took seven hours the first day, put it aside for twoweeks, and then finished it in a nine-hour day when I picked it back up. Now,it’s easy to write a bad screenplay in two days, so that doesn’t mean much.However, this particular screenplay placed as a semifinalist in the Nicholl’scompetition and Greg Beals, the director of the foundation told me it wouldhave won if I’d sent it in the year before, but the previous year’s winner wasremarkably close to mine and he said they never picked two screenplays in a rowthat were this much alike. But, it placed in the top 100 out of 4,500 entries.So, I take that as validation that it was a good screenplay. Written in twodays. Don’t think I could write a novel like that. And, I’d just learnedformatting the week before and had read my first screenplay ever that sameweek. As Gore Vidal said about Jack Kerouac: “That’s not writing; that’styping.” I don’t write them anymore because I’m too old. After the age of 35,it’s virtually impossible to sell a screenplay to Hollywood. Notice I didn’tsay “impossible.” I said “virtually” impossible. And, it is. Hollywood isclearly an ageist society in every segment of the business except forproducing. 3.     How did you go about mastering the craft of writing?That’seasy! By reading. That’s the only way to learn how to write. There are no“secrets” in learning how to write. The “secrets” are right out in the open.They’re on the page of the book you have open before you. All you have to do issee how the author accomplished what they did and you’re learning to write. Iregularly get writers in my classes who haven’t read a book in months or evenyears and I know there’s no way they’ll ever be a writer. But, I’ll alsoencounter a student who has read voraciously from the age of five or six andnever stopped, and I know that person has a chance at becoming a writer. 4.     How important do you think it is for fiction writers to obtain an MFA?Again, aneasy question. I think it’s totally unimportant. In fact, I think most programsdestroy more writers than help them. I kind of agree with Flannery O’Connorwho, when asked if writing programs discouraged writers, said: “Not enough ofthem.” And I have one. I have two degrees—(well, three—I also have a B.A.)—anMFA and a Certificate in Barbering from Pendleton Reformatory. Of the two, Ivalue my barbering certificate much, much more. I’ve made far more money,enjoyed far more success with that one.First,take a look at who the teachers and professors are in most programs. What havethey done and what have they sold? If Stephen King ever showed up in an MFAprogram it would only be because he was slumming and bored and wanted a change.Most of the folks (not all!) teaching in many such programs are writing thekind of books Kurt Vonnegut was referring to when he said, “Literature is indanger of disappearing up its own asshole.”And, mostMFA programs are dedicated to teaching “literary” fiction. I don’t know aboutyou, but do I want to spend thousands of dollars and use up a couple years ofmy life to learn to write something that’s basically dying? I don’t know whatyour I.Q. is but mine’s over 160 and I try to put it to use, especially forquestions like this.Years ago,an Ivy League college performed a study in which they looked at a random groupof a hundred professional writers. They identified them as “professional” bythe only legitimate definition of the term—writers who earned their entireincome from writing. They discovered that almost exactly half of these writershad a high school diploma or less… and the other half had a college bachelor’sdegree or higher. There’s really no correlation between writing education andwriting success. What an MFA degree does do is give the student access todecision-makers. Lots of publishers and editors visit these campuses and lotsof editor’s eyes light up when they see “MFA” in the writer’s query letter.However, most of these editors are the ones who are still looking for literarynovels and believe there’s a decent market for such. A shrinking number…Theseprograms used to have more value even a few years ago than they do today. Thesedays, they’re seen by many universities and colleges as “cash cows” and they’respringing up everywhere. And, like anything that gets bigger like this, thequality goes down, commensurately. At one time, there were perhaps five-sixpretty good programs. Now there are hundreds. If anyone thinks they’re as goodand as beneficial for writers as they used to be, well I’d like their phonenumber because I have this terrific bridge in Brooklyn I’m trying to move…That said,there is one program I think is a great one and one I wish had been around whenI got mine. Seton Hill focuses on genre writing (about time somebody did!), andeverything I hear about it is positive. They appear to be a program that’saware that it’s now 2012.5.     As a creative writing teacher, what are some of the most common mistakes thatyou see beginning writers making in both fiction and nonfiction?Notfollowing the two elements that are always present in good writing. Beinteresting and be clear. Of the two, being interesting is the most important.After that, there are structural problems that are very common. Most writershave never been taught story structure, or if they have, often it’s an archaicstructure. Most English classes, most college writing classes, many MFAprograms are focused on “parts” or writing. All these “exercises” ondescription, or characterization or dialog or whatever. Yuch! Listen, onedoesn’t get to Carnegie Hall by practicing the scales. They get there byunderstanding what a symphony is and how to write a complete symphony. I hateit when writers refer to what they’re writing as the “piece” they’re workingon. What in the hell is a “piece” of writing? Dude! Dudette! Write somethingthat’s complete and entire. A short story. A novel. Talk about your novel, notthe “piece” you’re working on.The twobiggest mistakes beginning writers make are not using their own, particular,unique voice, and not beginning the story of nonfiction article or book in theright place. After that, the next biggest problem is not striving for andachieving what Flannery O’Connor said about the best of novels (badlyparaphrased) that they be: “All of a piece; all of a unified effect.” So manynovels end up episodic with no through-line. In other words, a mish-mash ofscenes and quirky characters. That’s a novel of which the author can say,truthfully, that it’s “only available in my room.”6.     One of your well-known writing books is Hooked: Write Fiction that Grabs theReader at Page One and Never Lets Them Go. What are the important elementsin hooking a reader early?To beginwhere the story begins. It’s that simple. A contemporary story is about onething and one thing only. Trouble. That means the story should begin—whenthe trouble begins. Not the week before, not two years before, not even twominutes before. When the trouble begins. Period. And, that seems to be adifficult concept for many to master. Something has to create and/or revealthat trouble to the protagonist. That event is the inciting incident. And,that’s where stories today need to begin.There wasa time in our culture when novels could begin more leisurely. This was a time beforetelevision and movies and CNN and iPods and all the other entertainment venueswere upon us. Today’s reader doesn’t have the attention span nor the interestin picking up novels with leisurely openings. That doesn’t mean stories shouldbegin with gunfights, stabbings, bombs blowing up, kidnappings, murders, or anyof that melodramatic stuff. It means they have to open with conflict—the majorconflict that forms the core of the story. It can be a quiet conflict, but whatit can’t be is a lengthy account of the protagonist’s bucolic life for the tenyears before the trouble began. It has to begin with the trouble. Period.Whenmovies began, they had no structural models, so they used novels as theirmodels. Today, it’s been reversed. Novels have to imitate film structure. Yearsago, screenwriting how-to books insisted the first ten minutes of a screenplaybe “devoted to the setup.” No mas, again quoting Roberto Duran. Those days are,in the words of my son, “so five minutes ago.” Films today begin… when thetrouble begins. As should novels.We read anovel for one reason. To see if and how the protagonist is going to resolve thestory problem. If there’s no problem on the page, for that novel the reader isgoing to become… a nonreader. Count on it. Very few (and they don’t count)readers pick up a book just to encounter in the beginning a nifty shooting inan alley. If they don’t know the characters or the protagonist’s story problem,why would they care? There are a million places to see someone get shot. Justclick on the nightly news. There has to be a reason to turn to Page 2. Thatreason is we see a character with a compelling problem—one we can relate to—onPage 1.7. Beginnings are so important, especially intoday’s marketplace. How does a writer determine if they have started theirnovel in the right place? Do you have an opinion on using prologues?If they’vebegun with the introduction of the event that created and/or revealed theproblem that’s going to occupy the protagonist for the following 349 pages,they’ve begun in the right place. If they’ve begun anywhere else—they haven’t.Also, thatneeds to be written in a scene. Everything truly important in a novel needs tobe delivered via a scene. Not through the character’s ruminations or thoughts orthat kind of thing. A scene. When I pick up a manuscript and it’s the characterthinking on the page, my Nexium starts to malfunction and I can feel the bilebeginning to rise and voila! I’m throwing up in my mouth.The reasonso many writers fail, is that they don’t write scenes. They write a character’sthoughts and ruminations. They deliver descriptions of emotions based on eventsthe reader hasn’t been witness to, via a scene. Doesn’t work. I see this inhigh school students beginning to write poetry. They deliver all thesedescriptions of emotions based on something the reader hasn’t been privy to andthink that that’s poetry. It isn’t. The only way the reader is impactedemotionally is by living through the event right along with the character and atthe same time. Period.Prologues?I think the vast majority… what’s the word?… oh, yeah… suck. Most aren’tneeded. Now, for those who practice selective reading, I didn’t say “all.” Isaid “most.” Occasionally, one might work—although I can’t think of anyoffhand. Most, I suspect, come from a writer who’s been admonished not to beginwith setup or backstory and just has to provide that crap… so they create aprologue. I use an example of one in a brilliant book. Larry Watson’s Montana1948. He uses one in his terrific novel and it won major awards and is oneof my favorite books. But, it wasn’t needed. Not at all.I feel thesame about epilogues. Mostly, I think they come from writers who don’t know howto tie up the loose ends with the plot, so they stick ‘em on to accomplishthat. I think most would be better served in learning how to plot better… 8. Howimportant do you think it is for authors to maintain a strong social mediapresence?  What tips do you have for keeping a successful writing blog?Mostlydepends on who you are. If you’re Joyce Carol Oates, it’s probably notimportant in the least. If you’re Les Edgerton, it might be…I’mprobably the wrong person to ask what it takes for keeping a successful writingblog. I have one and I don’t know if I’d call it successful or not! I mean, Ionly have 250+ followers. I’ve had more people watch me pull off a crime… Ifnumbers aren’t important, then I feel it’s successful. I’ve made wonderfulcontacts through it and many that have helped me not only sell my books buteven helped me get them published. As to what makes it successful, I think it’sto base it on the same elements I feel important in a good novel. Beinteresting and be clear. I don’t know if it’s always clear, but I do try hardto make it interesting. After all, there are about sixteen bazillion blogs outthere and if yours ain’t interesting, then who’s going to want to read it? Ifigure it it’s interesting to me, then it might be interesting to others. Maybenot… I have weird tastes… I also have a mean, contrarian side to me. I don’tbelieve in telling people necessarily what they want to hear. There are enoughpeople out there in writing telling folks they’re great and that writing’s easyand all that stuff. There are just lots of folks who aren’t great and theirwriting sucks and somebody maybe ought to tell them that. How else do we getbetter if we don’t know we’re bad?9.     On your blog, you have posted the first chapter of your new writing book, AFiction Writer’s Workshop at the Bijou.  Do you think giving away thefirst chapter is helpful for building sales?Goodquestion! And, the answer is—I don’t know. I hope so. If the readers see it asvaluable information—and early responses say it is—then I think it’ll provehelpful. Plus, although I plan on self-publishing it, chances are some editoror other gatekeeper will come across it and think: “Hey, I can sell thatpuppy.” And then ring me up on the telly. Who knows? After all, those folkswhose first meeting with Ed McMahon was on their front porches were real peoplegetting those giant checks… 10.     Many authors are choosing to self-publish now. Do you see that as a viableoption? What are the pros and cons?Only undervery special circumstances would I self-publish. And, I am for two books. Oneisn’t really self-publishing. We’ve obtained the rights from Writer’s Digestfor a very successful book they published of mine—Finding Your Voice—andI’m publishing an ebook version of it since they opted not to. I’m pretty surethere’s a sizeable audience. It earned out its advance of $8,000 within sixweeks of its release way back when and every year has paid me excellentroyalties. I’m pretty sure there’s an audience for that book, particularlysince it hasn’t appeared in ebook format.The secondinstance is the Bijou book you referred to above. If I was a beginning writerwith no street cred, there’s no way I’d self-publish it. But, I’ve got a prettydecent track record with sales of my other two writer’s how-tos, so I’m fairlyconfident that will translate into decent sales. Hooked just doesn’t letup in sales, year after year, so that tells me I have an audience. Plus, I’vedelivered and continue to deliver, a four-hour workshop on the film I use asthe basis of the book—Thelma & Louise—to writing groups andworkshops and draw absolutely rave reviews for the presentation, so I knowthere’s a significant audience for it and that it fills what I see as a hole inthe writing how-to canon. Hope so, anyway! 11.     Do you have any upcoming workshops, classes or author services to share withus?I’ve beeninvited to appear and do a reading of my work at Noir at the Bar in St. Louisat Subterranean Books on April 28 that I’m pretty jazzed about. Great, famousvenue! One of my publishers, Cort McMeel of Bare Knuckles Press got me the gigvia the host, Jed Ayres, to help promote my novel, The Bitch.

I just wish you’d tell the folks what youthink. You’re just too shy.But, you’re one of the best writers around, not to mention a great guy.Paul D     Brazill says: March 26, 2012 at 9:14 am Fantastic stuff from a brilliant writer.Bailey     Alexander says: March 26, 2012 at 10:55 am Great questions and really interesting answers. As Flaubertsaid, “no such thing as truth, only perceptions…” ; )Jackie     Shannon Hollis says: March 26, 2012 at 11:28 am Wow, Les is great. No bs…direct and funny. I like what yousay about self publishing and the absence of vetting in the process. Especiallywhen it comes to fiction.Robin Billlings says:     March 26, 2012 at 11:35 am Les, I appreciate your honesty, and agree with what yousaid! Great to see the truth of how things are now. laid out so well.Les Edgerton says:     March 26, 2012 at 11:43 am Thanks, folks. Full disclosure–I know Bob and Paul andthey’re friends… and I know where they live.. Thanks, guys. Bailey, Flaubertgot it right and I agree. Hope people realize these are just myopinions–nothing more, nothing less. One of the reasons I love being awriter-unlike insurance salesfolks and politicians we get to express our trueopinions. Plus, I’ve reached an age where it’s more important to me to betruthful than tactful. Jackie, right on! Folks love to talk about Hemingway andhis b.s. detector, but often, when they come up against someone who actuallyemploys one, some don’t like it. I don’t hate people who use vanity publishing,but don’t claim it’s something else. The cost is just less with ebooks. It’sstill vanity press books. The thing is no one is “entitled” to having alegitimate publisher put out their books, especially if they’re crummy. Often,they are. There’s really a reason no one’s discovered some of these people’sgenius. It’s because… there isn’t any. It’s never been easy to get publishedand it shouldn’t be. Ask Fitzgerald who was told by Zelda that she wouldn’tmarry him until he published something and he papered his walls withrejections.At a time when it was easier to get published than today… It’s howyou learn what’s good. By getting rejected. You either get good, or… you getgone. Until self-publishing…I better shut up now…Andrea Hurst says:     March 26, 2012 at 11:50 am Just to add a bit of spice here, even though I am aliterary agent, I am considering self publishing my first novel.Traditional publishing is in transition and there is a lot of opportunity outthere in eBook land. Saw short memoir published on Kindle only last year, sell over 40,000 in six months. I don’tthink a publisher would have even signed it.What do readers want? We have to seriously ask that question now.anna     quinn says: March 26, 2012 at 12:17 pm Interesting interview-I nodded my head in several placesand wanted to argue with him in others, which made it a good read. I followEdgerton’s blog and glean many an interesting gem from it. We’ve heard hisopinion on self-publishing and the legacy publishers-now I’d like to hear whathe thinks about all the thousands of independent presses popping up.Les Edgerton says:     March 26, 2012 at 12:23 pm Andrea, have you considered publishing an ebook versionwith one of the publishers who are doing well (and aren’t self-publishing) likeAaron Patterson over at StoneGate? Several others I’m aware of (and you mostlikely know far more than I do!) would be delighted to publish you, I’d think.Andrea Hurst says:     March 26, 2012 at 12:44 pm Let’s talkAndrea Hurst says:     March 26, 2012 at 12:45 pm Go ahead and argue, let’s see what you think.Les Edgerton says:     March 26, 2012 at 1:44 pm Before I’d self-publish, I’d look at legitimate ebookpublishers, especially those who are doing significant things. Just two thatcome to mind are Aaron Patterson’s StoneGate Publishing and Cort McMeel’s andEddie Vega’s Bare Knuckles Press. Eddie has several other imprints under theBKP umbrella, one which would fit what you’re doing well.The thing is, folks this are vetting the books theypublish, much as legacy publishers do, but they have a couple of advantages.One, they can take chances on books that may not be as commercial as legacypublishers require. Most of these publishers adhere closer to what I suspectmore publishers would like to do–publish books more on their quality than theircommercialism. Two, they can and do move much quicker than a print press. Signwith them and a month or two later your book is out there. Three, these two aswell as others, also do print runs in addition to the ebook versions. Four, theeditorial quality is as high as it is with legacy publishers. Top-notch. Four,the royalty rates are much higher and fairer to the author than what we getwith legacies. I’ve also found the author is afforded a much greater degree ofcontrol over his/her book than with a legacy publisher for which the author hasalmost no controlAndrea, I didn’t know if you meant for me to argue it hereon in private, but I have these and other very sound reasons why I’d suggestyou investigate what these publishers offer. I think you’d be very surprised.Hope this helps!Blue skies,LesHelen     Ginger says: March 26, 2012 at 1:50 pm Les, this would have been more valuable if you could justlearn to speak your mind. (I’d type a smiley face, but I fear retribution.)Enjoyed your post and learned a lot. I don’t agree with youabout ebooks. I think there are legitimate authors doing their own publishing.I also think they’re getting lost among the thousands, perhaps millions, ofother ebooks.Les Edgerton says:     March 26, 2012 at 1:54 pm Anna, I love all the indie publishers springing up. What’sgoing on is just an accelerated version of what’s always gone on, both in booksand in films. When writers like Bukowski couldn’t get published in America,along came a guy who founded a small, independent press to do so. When WarnerBros. became a conglomerate, and would only do “safe” movies, along came theCoen Brothers. It happens constantly in media. When companies–publishers andfilm companies–get too big, they get top-heavy and can’t move quickly or they'll upsettheir stockholders. They begin to pass on taking chances. Indies come along andwhile most fail, a few make it, and they begin to grow. For instance, the CoenBrothers are still calling themselves “indies” but they haven’t been an indiefor a long time. They’re not yet approaching the critical mass of a 20thCentury yet, but they will… and then they’ll begin acting the same. And, then,another filmmaker will come along and… Same with publishers. It’s all healthyand keeps the dead wood cleaned out. All of it is cyclic and has happenedbefore and will continue to happen. For those outside the mean or average, it’salways good news. And, those daring young men with their press machines willsomeday grow fat and old and someone else will come along and take their lunchaway. As writers… it’s all good, imo!Les Edgerton says:     March 26, 2012 at 2:56 pm Hi Helen,I agree with you that there are legitimate authors self-publishing… just asthere are and have been legitimate authors who self-published print versions oftheir books with vanity publishers. I can only speak for me when I say Iwouldn’t buy their print self-published books and I wouldn’t buy theirself-published ebooks. In certain instances, self-publishing is legitimate–as Isaid, I’m self-publishing two books myself. But, one has already beensuccessful as a legacy published book and the other hasn’t, but it has been offeredcontracts twice and an advance of 10K and I turned it down because I didn’twant to write it the way they wanted. What I’m not willing to support is thewriter who’s been turned down a handful of times, if they’ve even sent it out,and feels they’re “entitled” to being published. They’re entitled to publishingit themselves but I’m also entitled to not buying it. I’m not the only writerwho feels like this–I’ve heard from many of my fellow writers who feel the sameway, but don’t want to hurt anyone’s feelings. My feeling is we’re loweringstandards in the field of letters. But… it’s just an opinion! Not anythingelse.Margaret     Duarte says: March 26, 2012 at 4:47 pm I’m glad I stopped by to read this valuable interview, Les.I appreciate they way you “say it like it is.” I happen to agree with you onjust about every point. I loved your books, “Hooked” and “Finding Your Voice,”and highly recommend them. I haven’t read any of your fiction–yet. Will do sosoon.Les Edgerton says:     March 27, 2012 at 6:00 am Thanks, Margaret! Hope you enjoy the fiction. I’d suggestTHE BITCH and JUST LIKE THAT, and if those don’t make you call the cops to lockme up, then some of the others…So there you have it. I imagine some will agree with me and others won't. And, that's good. Hope you enjoyed our little interview.Blue skies,Les"},

{"title": "Noir@Bar, tragedies and film news", "date": "Tuesday, November 19, 2013", "text": "Hi folks,It’s been kind of a bad and good week! Last Saturday, as mywife Mary and I climbed into the car to drive down to Indianapolis where I wasone of the participants at the Noir @ The Bar, C.J. Edwards was hosting, Marygot a call that her father was dying. We headed over to the hospice and he wasbasically in a coma. Kind of déjà vu, as her mother had just passed away aboutthree weeks ago and the scene was much the same. She got to tell him she lovedhim and we talked about staying and I could cancel the reading, but there wasno way to know how long he’d last so we decided to go on down. Just as we gotto Indy a couple of hours later, she got the phone call that informed her he’dexpired.Mary didn’t want to tell anyone there as she didn’t want todeal with folks coming up and giving her their sympathy—she appreciates it, butjust didn’t want to deal with it then. Plus, she’s just the best... and toughest person I've ever known.Anyway, we had a blast at the reading. Saw some old friendsand met some new ones. If anyone’s interested, the folks from the famous BookedPodcast were there—Livius Nedin and Robb Olson—and they recorded all of us reading.You can access it at their site at: http://www.bookedpodcast.com/They’re providing in four episodes and I’d listen to them all. A great lineupof noir writers!We got some great pub that morning. On the Indy TV news, they announced the top three events for the weekend. We were named #2 behind #1 the Tiny Tots event with Tom Petty, the Pixies, and the Grateful Dead, and ahead of the state finals for the high school marching bands. We should have been #1, but then it WAS the Grateful Dead, so... Here’s photos of all of us except for the host, C.J.(Chris) Edwards. I have a theory why he didn’t have a picture—he’s a cop and Ithink he’s undercover and he knows a lot of my criminal friends visit here sohe didn’t want them to know what he looks like…  Chris put together a wonderful event and I hope he makesit an annual get-together. We read in the awesome club, the Fountain Square Brewery and were in the actual brewery behind the bar. Tried to find a tap but were forced to go out to the bar and buy our drinks...Top to bottom: Clayton Lindemuth, David James Keaton, James Ward Kirk, Jed Ayres, moi, and Scott Phillips.

{"title": "My online novel writing class has a couple of openings...", "date": "Tuesday, October 29, 2013", "text": "Hi folks,UPDATE: The class has been filled. Thanks to all who applied. We do have unlimited openings for those who'd like to audit. Just wanted to let anyoneinterested know that we have a couple of openings for the next session of ourongoing creative writing (novel) class, which will begin on November 10. Students have dubbed it \"Les Edgerton's Boot Camp for Writers.\" Normally,we don’t have openings, but we have several members who finished their novelsin the last class and have secured agents and are taking the time off to workon the notes in their final rewrites before their books go out to market. Someare able to continue the class when this happens, but we have a couple thistime who need all the time they can get to get that final polish done. Pleasecontact me if interested or if you’d like more information by emailing me at butchedgerton@comcast.net.The way our class works isfairly unique. It’s just like being in an “on-ground” class. We restrict classsize to ten people so that sufficient quality time is spent on eachparticipant. The way our class works is that each week, members send in up toten pages of the novel they’re working on. The class is divided into twosections, and when you send your work in, each person in your group is requiredto read it carefully and provide constructive comments. In turn, that persondoes the same to his classmates’ work. Each of the two groups will have fivemembers, which means if you join us, you’ll be responsible for reading each weekfour other writers’ work and providing a solid critique on each of them andthey will do the same for you. (You can see the other group's work as well, but only provide crits on your group's work.) I provide comments/critiques on everyone’s work.We don’t subscribe whatsoever to the oft-used “sandwich” method of critique,where you provide a bit of praise, then address a negative, then provideanother bit of praise. If the work sucks, the writer is told it sucks. (Nicely, usually...) If itworks, he/she will be told it works. It’s a totally honest class and most ofthe folks in it are extremely knowledgeable about the writing craft. A greatmany have been with us for several years and have had considerable success withtheir own work. Nobody is out to be “mean” to a fellow member, but none of ussuffer fools gladly. If a writer wants praise and constant pats on the back,our class is probably not for them. It’s not that we don’t dole out praise whenit’s earned, but our total focus is on the work and if it’s of publishablequality or not. And, we have an extraordinarily high percentage of success. Mostwho have stayed the course with us have secured agents and/or book deals. But,it’s only fair to warn those who might be considering joining us, this isn’t aclass for sissies or thin-skinned writers. We simply don’t have time for any ofthat.I’m probably scaring offfolks, but I feel it’s necessary to make potential class members aware thatthis isn’t an easy class. But, we do end up with almost everyone securing a topagent and/or book deal if they stay the course. For most writers, this willentail at least two or more classes and usually more.Our only goal ispublication. Period. And… legitimate publication by a traditional press.A new member of class has alarge hurdle to overcome. New members are required to submit a particularoutline of their novel, which consists of five statements totaling 15-20 words.A handout will be provided which fully describes what we’re looking for and how to write it. Newstudents are only allowed to send in the first five pages of their novel, whichmust contain the inciting incident that creates and/or reveals the storyproblem the novel will be concerned with. Seasoned pros who have taken theclass and continue to take it each time, have named this “inciting incidenthell.” And, it can be. In over four years of offering this class, I have yet tohave a single writer escape inc inc hell the first week. On an average, itprobably takes three weeks to grasp the concepts we’re teaching and require tobe allowed to escape it and graduate to where they can begin sending in up toten pages each week.Here’s one of our favoritestories we relate to new folks. Maegan Beaumont took the first class with meseveral years ago when I was offering it through Phoenix College (accreditedclass). She came to class with a finished, 700+ page novel. That novel is longgone. The Phoenix College classes were 12 weeks long at that time. Well, Maeganspent ten weeks of the twelve before she escaped inciting incident hell. Whichmeant that for ten weeks she was required to send in her rewritten first fivepages until she got it right. Ten weeks out of a total of 12 for the entire course…Until our last session, she owned the all-time record and finally anotherwriter tied her record. Won’t name that writer, but the quality of the workthat person is presently submitting is light-years better than what she beganwith, just like Maegan did. Maegan’s confessed to me that she absolutely hatedme for most of that period. That’s fine. Hate bounces off of me like water offthe proverbial duck’s back. I don’t care about people’s feelings—I care aboutthem becoming good writers. (Well, I do care about their feelings, but I tryhard not to show it…). Sounds horrible, doesn’t it? Well, at the time, I expectMaegan would describe her experience as such. But, little by little she learnedto write a publishable novel.Maegan ended up finishingthe novel she began in that first class after several more classes and guesswhat? She secured a top agent and he got her a two book deal with Midnight Ink,a solid advance, and now they want even more books from her. Her first novelearned rave reviews and is selling tons of copies. Her second comes out thisspring. These days, she’s about to begin her third book and is theadministrator of our class. What happened is that she decided she wanted tolearn now to write quality books and she decided she didn’t need to be coddledor lavished with praise she hadn’t earned. She's also earning a solid reputation in the writing community as the \"Plot Queen.\"In the class that justended, we had three people secure an agent with their finished novels, with two or threemore about to do the same. All of their novels will be placed with toppublishers. Each of them has worked their asses off to get there. Another studentwho dropped out after being with us for four or five sessions had essentiallyfinished her novel in class and has just signed with a top agent. The onlyreason she dropped out when she did was for time purposes for a new job (werequire a high and serious commitment to the class), but her novel wasessentially completed. This isn’t NaNoWrite or whatever that thing is called.In fact, it’s probably the antithesis of that event. There may be other classeswith as high a percentage of members getting published, but I’m not aware ofany. At this point, there’s not a single writer in class who isn’t writing at apublishable level. Not one. And, probably none of them was even close to thatstate before beginning. I’m very, very proud of these folks! They’ve all becomewriters and not a one of them are… typists…Whatever genre you’rewriting in doesn’t matter. We have literary novels, thrillers, YAs,middle-grade novels, fantasy, sci-fi, mainstream, historical fiction, comicnovels, and just about every genre you can imagine. Doesn’t matter.I realize I’ve given you alot of reasons to not take our class! It’s hard, hard work, it represents asignificant time commitment, and there isn’t any semblance of instantgratification. In other words, it’s a class for writers, not wannabe writerswho want to have written a book but aren’t particularly crazy about doing theactual work required. If despite all this, you’re interested, please contactme. Openings won’t last long if past classes are any indication.The nuts and bolts:Cost: $400 for 10 weeks.Nonrefundable. The reason it’s nonrefundable is because, other than S.S. thisis my main source of income. If a person decides after a week or two it’s toohard for them or for any reason they can’t continue, there’s no way to addreplacements. I like to eat and make my house payment so I have to make it anonrefundable basis. I also work privately with clients and that charge is $100per hour. I give the same level of attention to everyone in class that I dowith private students, so this is a much more affordable cost for most. Asthose who join us will see, I give much more than an hour to each person eachweek. And, before anyone asks, I’m sorry but I’m fully booked with privateclients at present, although that can always change.Start date: November 10.Ordinarily, we’ll take a week and sometimes two off during the class torecharge our batteries and, in this case, because of the upcoming holidays.Option: We also offer anauditing opportunity for $50. Auditors have access to everything we do. Theonly difference is they don’t participate actively with us. Many have foundauditing a valuable alternative. I had a young man tell me after he’d auditedone of our classes that he’d learned much more during that period than he hadin the entire four years of his college years in writing classes. It’s alsowhere we usually draw new students from when an opening occurs. They’re givenfirst choice. In fact, the students who had to take a leave of absence fromthis coming session to perform the final polish to their novels have chosen toaudit the class. There is no limit to how many sign up to audit the class. We also have several editors and publishers and even agents who've audited the class.If anyone would like totalk to any of the folks who’re taking the class, I’d be happy to put you intouch with any and all of them. Just ask.Hope this is something afew of you are looking for. If so, please contact me.And, thanks for reading andyour consideration!Blue skies,Les Top Photo: Maegan Beaumont delivering a talk and a signing at the Poisoned Pen Bookstore in Phoenix.

{"title": "Excerpt from the new craft book I'm writing, on Protatonists and Antagonists.", "date": "Monday, October 28, 2013", "text": "Hi folks,As many of you know, I'm writing a new craft book on using movies to inform fiction techniques, titled A FICTION WRITER'S WORKSHOP AT THE BIJOU. In it, I'm using the film THELMA & LOUISE as my model. I've read thousands of screenplays and seen thousands of movies and this is, hands-down, the very best model for writers I've come across. In virtually every single frame, there's a teachable moment for fiction writers.Delivering one of those \"teachable moments...\"One of the problems I've determined that face writers are the terms we employ in our advice/instruction. We borrow freely from lay terms, such as \"action\" and the like and often the writer sitting in our classes apply the lay definitions to these terms, not realizing we intend a different meaning. The word \"action\" for example. Often, writers take this to indicate more melodramatic definitions and when they are told their story needs to begin with \"action\" they start off with shootings, buildings being blown up, kidnappings, murders and the like. Not that some stories shouldn't begin with those kinds of actions, but the term action when used for fictive purposes means something far more encompassing than simple physical actions. \"Action\" in fiction terms is used to denote almost any kind of activity involving conflict, either overt or covert. Dialog, for example, is action. Reading something that creates tension and a story problem is action. Seeing a dead bird by the side of the road is action if it elicits a memory and a realization.I don't intend this to be a discourse on the word action, but am just using a simple term to illustrate how writing instruction becomes perverted by an imprecise understanding of the terms borrowed from the lay language, the word \"action\" being only one of many such terms incorrectly applied.For example, in James Baldwin's brilliant short story, \"Sonny's Blues,\" the story begins with the protagonist sitting in a subway car reading the day's newspaper. In it, he comes across a news story about his brother's arrest. Instantly, this creates a bona fide story problem for him. In this instance, reading is an action. Nobody was shot or killed, nobody was kidnapped, no bombs went off, none of that. He is just sitting... reading. That's just one of many examples of what the term \"action\" means in fiction.Now. The two terms I want to talk about today are the terms \"protagonist\" and \"antagonist.\" The following is an excerpt from Chapter Two of the book I'm writing. I'm aware that what I say here will go against what you may have been told from others. You'll have to determine for yourself if what I promulgate has sufficient evidence to prove what I'm proposing as the definitions for these terms. You may agree with me or you may choose to disagree. At the least, I hope I've given you solid food for thought.And, without further ado, here's a bit of Chapter Two, on the definitions of Protagonists and Antagonists.CHAPTER TWOProtagonists and AntagonistsThe two most important charactersin a novel are the protagonist and the antagonist. I want to spend some timedefining these two characters and their roles in the story as there are manymisconceptions.First, to define each term.The ProtagonistThe protagonist is simply theperson through whose eyes and viewpoint we experience the bulk of the story. Ifeel it a mistake to assign moral qualities to either the protagonist or theantagonist. Therefore, I believe it’s misleading to use terms such as “hero” or“heroine” to describe the protagonist. Doing so assigns a moral value to him orher that is not only inaccurate, but that often leads to creating poorcharacters. When you think of protagonists as “good guys” and antagonist’s as“bad guys” or villains, the temptation is great to create one-dimensional,cardboard, almost “cartoonish” characters. Dudley Doright and Snidely Whiplash.By the same token, the term“antihero” is misleading. By its very name, it also implies a moral qualityassigned to the character. The protagonist is neither a hero nor an antihero.They’re simply the person through whose persona we experience the story.Do yourself a favor. Don’t thinkof these two characters as “good” and/or “bad.” I think you’ll find you createfar more complex and compelling characters by not doing so.Same way with that term that’scrept into our writing lexicon in the past few years. That main character thingy, or that even more insidious appellation,that “MC” monstrosity. That says… nothing. Of course the protagonist is the“main character.” But, to refer to him or her with that term, negates somewhatthe value of the protagonist. Describing the protagonist as the “main character”implies that it’s the story that’s mostly important (at the expense ofcharacter) and that’s simply not true. All stories, regardless of genre, arepretty much the same. It’s the protagonist in his/her battle in the story toresolve the story problem that’s important. Plots are limited—there are only6-8, depending on the source. Characters—particularly protagonists—on the otherhand, are limitless. The life of any story isn’t the plot. It’s how theprotagonist and antagonist operate within the plot, not the clever and variousways in which the killings, bombings, kidnappings, love and/or sex scenes,naval button contemplations or whatever are depicted. Those things areincidental to the characters and only exist to serve the characters and providethe obstacles for the struggle.The AntagonistLikewise, don’t think of theantagonist in terms of villains. He or she is simply the person whose goal(s)conflict with those of the protagonist’s. Period. Again, just as with theprotagonist, no moral value is assigned, at least in relationship to thedefinition of their character. Not the “bad guy” or “bad gal.” If you think ofantagonists as villains, you’ll end up with Snidely Whiplash-type characters.One-dimensional, cardboard, cartoonish characters.The antagonist, just like theprotagonist, can be a good guy or gal or a bad guy or gal. Doesn’t matter.Novels aren’t morality plays. As Samuel Goldwyn said to the screenwriter whosent him a script with a theme of good and bad (badly paraphrased): “Don’t senda message. Western Union sends messages and they do it well. Send me a story.”Can there be more than oneprotagonist or antagonist?Nope.One protagonist, one antagonistper novel.Now, that doesn’t mean they eachcan’t have multiple allies. They both can and both most likely will.Are there exceptions? Probably,although I can’t think of any right now. Remember that just because a novel waspublished doesn’t “prove” it was any good. Doesn’t mean it’s a good model tofollow, necessarily. Bad novels get published just about every day. But, doyourself a favor and don’t use a bad novel for a template. I can pretty wellguarantee you that there aren’t very many good novels with “co-protagonists”and “multiple antagonists.”One of the reasons this is trueis that when you begin creating more than a single protagonist and/orantagonist, the reader’s focus begins to get diffused. We can “see” anindividual. Once you begin creating crowds, it becomes harder to figure outwhose story it is or who we should follow.Let’s look at Thelma & Louise for particularlygreat examples of a powerful protagonist and an equally-powerful antagonist.By the way, the strength of yournovel depends on the strength of your antagonist, not your protagonist. Writethat down. The antagonist should be at least the equal in strength of theprotagonist, and preferably stronger. This includes all forms of strength,including physical, mental, emotionally, resource-wise… in every way you candream up. If the antagonist is weaker in any way than the protagonist, then theprotagonist doesn’t have to do much to prevail, does he? And, you want theprotagonist’s struggle to be uphill all the way.The protagonist in Thelma & Louise is Thelma. Period. Iknow the title says Thelma andLouise, but it’s Thelma’s story. Louise is along for the ride and the primaryrole she serves is the Mentor role. Khouri was well-aware of that. If they wereco-protagonists, wouldn’t she have given Louise’s big sex scene the same bigstage as she did Thelma’s? She didn’t. It’s Thelma’s story, all the way.Another factor that determineswho the protagonist is is the character arc. You know, that old Freitag schemethat looks like a roller coaster? Only the protagonist gets that. His or hercharacter has to undergo a significant change as a result of the struggle she’sundergone to achieve the story goal. Only Thelma undergoes this change in thestory. Louise changes a bit, but by and large, at the end of the story, she’spretty much the same as she was at the beginning. Thelma, on the other hand,has had a profound change from where she began. You’ll see that change as we goalong here.And, the antagonist is… Hal thecop as played by Harvey Keitel. Is he a villain? Nope. Not in the least. He’sundoubtedly the single most moral character in the story. His goal iscompletely honorable and good… for those looking for good guys and bad guys intheir fiction.It’s just that his goal is indirect conflict with Thelma’s. His goal is to rescue Thelma and her friend,Louise. To save them first from going to jail and then, as the story evolves,to save them from being killed. Absolutely, 100% honorable goal. Can you seehow the terms “villain” doesn’t have a thing to do with Hal’s character? Do youthink for a second that if Khouri thought in those terms—heroes/heroines vsvillains—could have possibly written these characters—particularly Hal’s? Not achance in hell! If her knowledge of story had rested on those kinds ofdefinitions, she would be writing direct-to-video screenplays, if even that.Please—if you get nothing elsefrom this book—never again think of your characters as hero/heroine andvillain!Are there characters in the storywho provide obstacles for Thelma? Sure. Her husband Darryl is about as“villainy” as you could ever wish for. Just about every male character in thestory provide opposition. J.T. steals their money even though he does affordThelma respect in their love-making. The state cop with the tailored uni andmirror sunglasses and male chauvinist hog attitude is villainy. The tankerdriver with his pig-like gestures and intentions is villainy. Harlan, thewould-be rapist is definitely villainy. The guys manning gas pumps when theystop, or are leaning up against building posts ogling them, are all minorvariations of villainy. And, guess what? Just about all of those characters fitthe Snidely Whiplash mold. No antagonists in that bunch, except in a verylimited, stereotypical role, basically as villainous.Louise’s boyfriend Jimmy, is pretty much a good guy, but he’s definitely not anantagonist. He’s one of their few “helpers” when he comes to Louise’s aid (and,by extension, Thelma’s). No opposition to Thelma’s goal there.The one character whose goalprovides consistent and powerful opposition to Thelma’s goal is Hal. She wantsto escape; his goal is to catch her.And it’s that dynamic that makesfor complex characters and complex stories. Two individuals, each with a goalat odds with the other. Both with worthy goals. No “good vs evil” going on hereat all. Each the very model of a great protagonist/antagonist. A very powerfulantagonist. Look at Hal’s strengths. He’s a lawman with tons of experiencecatching criminals. He’s got all the technological advantages possible. He’sgot a virtual army of people to help him find and catch them. He’s got state ofthe art computers, communications, transportation, radar, phone trackingcapability at his disposal. He’s got the state police along with the FBI at hisdisposal. He’s got a frickin’ helicopter! He’s got all this arrayed against ahousewife and a waitress in a car and little money and their destination known.He’s extremely powerful and about as strong of an antagonist as you could everinvent. When Thelma defeats him—which she does in the final scene—it resonateswith the viewer since she hasn’t beaten a weakling at all but an antagonistthat was stronger in just about every single way. Think about how this storywould have been had Khouri made Hal a nasty guy who hated women and just wantedto either kill Thelma and Louise or just wanted to put them in jail. She couldhave done that… if she thought in terms of “heroines” and “villains.” But shedidn’t. She created a protagonist and gave her a worthy antagonist.Perhaps why she won the Oscar forthis story?I'm busy at work right now completing this book upon the urging of my agent. Hope when it's done, you'll consider glomming onto a copy.Hope this helps inform your own writing!Blue skies,Les P.S. Here's an \"old\" craft book I wrote that you may find useful.On Saturday, November 23, I’ll be conducting a REALLY BIG (channel your innerEd Sullivan voice here) workshop where I show the movie THELMA & LOUISE andprovide commentary throughout, showing salient fiction techniques, for theIndiana Writer’s Center.

{"title": "REVIEW OF SCOTT ADLERBERG'S SPIDERS AND FLIES ", "date": "Wednesday, October 23, 2013", "text": "Hi folks,When I was at the recent Bouchercon I had the pleasure of meeting and hanging out with Scott Adlerberg. And, then, when I got back home, I read his novel. I wish now I'd read his novel before meeting him! It's an amazing piece of work and I would have liked to tell him in person my opinion of it and talk to him about it. I guess I'll just tell him here what I thought...The whole time I satreading Scott Adlerberg’s novel SPIDERS AND FLIES, I kept thinking of the movieANGEL HEART starring Mickey Rourke. And couldn’t figure out why at first. Thestories aren’t similar, other than both contain supernatural elements, but themovie was set mostly in New Orleans and a bit in New York City, whereas Adlerberg’snovel takes place mostly in Martinique. And then it struck me. It physicallyand emotionally felt the same in bothexperiences—both forms cast a spell with atmospheric and nightmarish qualitiesthat permeated my senses. Close to what Jung meant when he spoke of the realmof the subconscious being where truth resides. Adlerberg uses language in thebest way—to create a film in the mind.If you took the plot andoutlined it, it probably wouldn’t make much sense. It certainly isn’t realisticor a portrayal of life from any “real” world. This isn’t the kind of noir thatfeatures meth addicts slashing and gashing their way through a redneckenvironment. This is noir of the highest order—the darkness of the soul and thenightmare we all seek to avoid but always know is there.I think that’s why I keptthinking of ANGEL HEART. This was the first and perhaps only film I’ve everseen that portrayed New Orleans accurately, with its dark undercurrents ofsavagery and primitivism. Unlike those horrid films like THE BIG EASY whichwere laughable and from which many native New Orleanians walked out of itsshowing in NOLA, either laughing or shaking their fists at the portrayal of acity that movie misinterpreted entirely. ANGEL HEART got New Orleans spot onand SPIDERS AND FLIES gets noir spot on. Certain of Faulkner’s novels do thesame. Where this novel’s beauty lies is in the author’s tremendous skill inusing language to beguile and bewitch and herd us into that place many writerstry to take us to—the fictive dream. And, that’s exactly what Adlerberg hascreated—a dream that you enter into. This is not a reading experience a Grishamfan would probably enjoy. It is a novel a Genet fan would appreciate.If this gets made into amovie, I’d look for a younger version of Mickey Rourke to play the lead. It’sperfect for the Rourke of ANGEL HEART or KILLSHOT. Directed by Hector Babenco,with the same kind of chops he brought to THE KISS OF THE SPIDER WOMAN.Try to read this novel whenyou can experience it straight through. Put the DO NOT DISTURB sign on yourdoor…Blue skies,Les"},

This review is from: TheRapist (Paperback) Truman Ferris Pinter sits on death row for the brutal rapehe has committed, and the death he seemingly caused his victim. Pinter tellshis story himself, and for the entire length of this astounding novella we sitsquarely in Truman's mind, as twisted and cold a mind as one is likely to comeacross anywhere. He's a man utterly without remorse for his actions, but healso happens to be very well-read and articulate. He lets us know in nouncertain terms that he has his reasons for what he did. THE RAPIST takes us ona tour through his convoluted mind, and through his twisted perceptions, webegin to understand his life, and damn if this utter sociopath makes us seethings (at least a little) from his point of view.Absolute brilliance is the only way I can describe this book. You could call ita noir novel, but I'd say it's more firmly in the tradition of works likeCamus' THE STRANGER or Ernesto Sabato's THE TUNNEL or Walker Percy's LANCELOT.The novel as existential monologue told by an unrepentant criminal. Edgertonhimself said that a prime inspiration for the novel came from the CharlesBukowski story \"The Fiend\", which is about a man raping a littlegirl. Except that in \"The Fiend\", as Edgerton put it, even Bukowskipulled back a bit, forgoing his usual first person narration to tell the storyin the third person. In other words, Bukowski didn't handle this material headon; Edgerton dares to.THE RAPIST also brings to mind Dostoyevsky's NOTES FROM THE UNDERGROUND and (Ido not say this blithely) Nabokov's LOLITA. Truman Ferris Pinter is even darkerin his personality than Humbert Humbert, but the brilliance and audacity heuses language with, to convince himself and us of certain things, is quite likeHumbert. How reliable is this narrator? And Truman, like Humbert, can be, shallwe say, not entirely self-aware. There is a house of mirrors quality to thisnovel that is quite Nabokovian. And as in LOLITA, we get inside the mind ofsomeone almost everyone would consider despicable, and if we don't, well, likehim, we certainly understand him. Then there's the Borges influence, themind-bending what is real what is dream what is real aspect of the book. In away completely appropriate to Truman, the novel ends in a manner that remindedme of Borges's great story \"The South.\" I really can't say much morethan that or I'll be giving too much away. Suffice it to say, the ending isperfect, the last line a dinger that sums up Truman and reduced me to dark darklaughter.This is a memorable book, a tough uncompromising book, a book that in the verybest way calls upon a great literary tradition to be not quite like anythingever written before it. 1 of 1 people found the following review helpful 5.0out of 5 stars Literary Noir, September 24, 2013 By Michelle T. Isler\"Godmother\" (Houston) - Seeall my reviews(REAL NAME)   This review is from: The Rapist (KindleEdition) This is my first Les Edgerton novel and it will not be mylast. I find it a true art to take a story about a truly, monstrous man likeTruman Ferris Pinter and present it in such a literary fashion. If it wasn'tsuch a heinous crime that Truman committed, you would feel a little bit sorryfor him. He had such a rough childhood that he taught himself to escape realityby floating outside of his body. His nightmare childhood became the life ofsomeone else, at least that is how he remembered it.As he waits on death row, he has a religious struggle within himself about whatwill happen to him after his number is called. If you do not have a religion,what will become of the soul? But, you have to wonder if Truman really had asoul.Beautifully written, yet very disturbing. I highly recommend it. Thanks! I appreciate the nice words!  Hope to see some of you at some of these events!Blue skies,Les"},
{"title": "HEROES...)", "date": "Monday, September 30, 2013", "text": "Hi folks,I love heroes and heroines. Heroes are what makes life tolerable and give us goals and show us… possibilities. It’s why I love sports so much. It’s that transcendent moment when the pitcher, exhausted beyond belief, reaches back to all those years of throwing in the backyard at the target on the barn wall, dreaming of that day in the last game of the World Series when he throws the final strike, goes to that moment in his memory and brings his exhausted body to the brink to throw the last pitch of a no-hitter. It’s that defining moment, when the tight end, goes up on the last play of the game and jumps six inches higher than he ever has before, to grab the ball and step across the end zone to win the game they were two touchdown underdogs in in the last possible second. It’s the race horse, bleeding from his heaving lungs who forces himself one last stride to go ahead of the favorite.It’s all those things and smaller moments where a lifetime of toiling in obscurity and anonymity for a moment that may never come that the athlete trains for, that when it does and he puts all those efforts into a superhuman effort, that define a person. And define us all as members of the human race. It’s those moments that show us what’s possible.I love competition. I abhor the mentality that’s given us “participation trophies” and make just showing up somehow credible.And, that’s why I like American Idol and Britain’s Got Talent and the other like programs so much. Are they cheesy? Yes, sometimes. Are they staged? Yes, sometimes. But, for all those instances, there are times when we get to see the human spirit lifted as high as it can possibly be lifted. And, those are the moments that reign supreme. It shows us the human spirit. And, nothing is more wondrous than a man or woman overcoming tremendous odds and succeeding. It takes the worst kind of person to ignore or boo that.I spent the entire afternoon watching those moments on TV and feel I’ve invested my time wisely. It feeds my soul. It makes me believe I can do the same in my writing. It makes me proud to be as member of this thing we call the human race.It shows me we all have possibilities—that we can all be heroic. And, why would anyone settle for anything less?Imagine…Blue skies,Les"},

{"title": "REVIEW OF CORROSION BY JON BASSOFF", "date": "Tuesday, September 24, 2013", "text": "Hi folks,I want to introduce you toa new book that is one of the best novels I’ve read in decades. First, adisclaimer: I confess I was favorably disposed to like this book even before Iopened the pages. It’s by Jon Bassoff, my publisher at New Pulp Press. Jon, in myopinion, is simply the single best publisher on the scene today. I say “in myopinion” because it’s just that. There may well be publishers as knowledgeable,as wise, as talented as Jon out there—and I know several who belong in thatupper 2%--folks like Allan Guthrie of Blasted Heath, Brian Lindenmuth ofSnubnose Press, Frank Nowatzke of the German press Pulpmaster, and some notableothers—but I’ve read every one of Jon’s list of published books and there isn’ta single clunker in the bunch. Not one! I don’t know of any other publisher whohas done what he has, and that doesn’t denigrate the ones mentioned nor anyothers—Jon has just put together an unparalleled list of writers and brilliantwork. (Click on the picture for the Amazon link.)That said, even though Iwas predisposed to like his book, I was completely caught unawares of the brillianceof CORROSION put out by DarkFuse. It absolutely blew me out of the water andsurpassed my already-lofty expectations.By ten miles.CORROSION is easily one of thebest novels I’ve read in the last decade and ranks up there—in my estimation—withthe best of Faulkner, Cormac McCarthy, Joe Lansdale and Tom Franklin. And, I read a lot. An average of five novels a week.It stars a protagonist thatI think will end up in the pantheon of the very best of dark characters such asAnton Chigurh, E.O. Smonk, and Joe Lon Makey—the tortured soul of Benton Faulk/JosephDowns/The Preacher… who are all the same man. Who loves two women enough totorture and kill them—Constance and then Lilith (the name of the first “Eve” inthe Bible, which should be a solid clue as to the depth of these characters.).This is the story told fromthe fevered and twisted mind of a sociopath/psychopath and when we are in thedark with him, we are genuinely and thoroughly frightened. I think I knowsomething about entering the mind of such a person as I think evidenced by myown character, Truman Ferris Pinter, but Bassoff makes me feel somewhat inferiorof my effort with the brilliance he brings to the task of showing us a dementedsoul. Benton Faulk is indeed, a monster, but Bassoff does what one of my advisers during my stay at Vermont College, Sharon Sheehe Stark, advised us todo when writing a truly despicable character. Instead of that oft-repeatedwriting “wisdom” others deliver—that “make your villain like kittens”—to gainthe reader’s sympathy—she advised the opposite. Don’t do that, Sharon alwayssaid, but rather: “Paint your character as black as you possibly can. The lightwill shine through the cracks.” And this is precisely what Bassoff has done.That light Sharon spoke of, does, indeed, shine through. And not through someblinding beacon but truly “through the cracks.”I won’t go into the plot—othersare much better at delivering plot synopses than I ever will be. I simply urgeyou to grab onto this novel as soon as you can. If you like truth in yourfiction, this is the place to find it. If you believe that in the worst of us aspark of humanity still resides, this is the place to prove that belief. If yousimply want to read literature with a capital L, this is where you’ll find it.If you want to read a book that is what Jean Paulhan spoke of in the preface tothe infamous STORY OF O, when he said: “Dangerous books are those that restoreus to our natural state of danger,” this again, is that book.Exactly so.Blue skies,LesUPDATE! CORROSION is to be a film! Details at http://www.dreadcentral.com/news/70620/jack-reher-penning-feature-film-adaptation-novel-corrosion"},

{"title": "BOUCHERCON PRIMER", "date": "Sunday, September 15, 2013", "text": "Hi folks,The annual Boucherconwriter’s conference is just around the corner! Because of that, it occurred tome that there may be some writers who will be going to their first writer’sconference and it is my sincere hope that the following tips and lore andlearned advice might be of value to those people, to show them how to maximizetheir experience and get the biggest bang for their buck. (This is a rerun, but has some new material added.)WRITER’S CONFERENCES--YAY!Many billions ofyears ago, when mankind (men, who were kindhearted and a couple of women) firstbegan to write, there were very few places to learn the craft. This was duringthe periods we know today as the PalaeolithicAge, the Mesolithic Age, the Neolithic Age, the first Roosevelt administration,Obama’s last six terms, and the Age of Aquarius.There were only acouple of women writers because they had to go to work to support theirwriter-husbands. There was virtually no money in those days forcave-drawing-writers. Certainly no medical plans!Mostly, there didn’texist places to learn how to write… because we didn’t have words in those days. (Or four-star hotels to host conventions) Writingwas a form where we used pictures, carved on cave walls. We had words, but justa few. Maybe a dozen. Words like “ugh” and “booty” and “dinosaur” and “self-aggrandizement.”And these few words only existed in oral form. There was no actual “writing” aswe know it today, because we didn’t even know such things that we considerbasic today, like dangling participles and adverbs. We didn’t even havedictionaries!Things were toughthen for writers. Not only didn’t we have dictionaries, we had to walk toschool ten miles each way… through six-foot snow drifts! Uphill, both ways...No, wait. That wassomething else. That was my childhood.The point is, we’vecome a long way, baby!Today, we have wordsand a modern phenomenon we call “sentences.” We have dictionaries and eventhesauruses (or is that thesauri?). We have COMPUTERS! We have all these thingsand we even have schools and other avenues to learn our craft. By schools, Imean MFA schools and institutions of higher learning based in the Carribbean. Where, when I went, you had to walk ten miles each way…through six-foot high snowdrifts!Just imagine Mark Twain with a computer... and that PCism stuff...Some things neverchange. (Some do...)Today, as we allknow, there are secrets to becoming a bestselling author. And, it’s becomeridiculously easy to acquire these secrets, when, once learned, one can quitthat bullshit day job in the RV factory and just travel around to bookstoresand sign mounds and mounds of our novels and eat at Elaine’s where we can waveacross the room to Woody Allen who is a GENIUS. (Like us.)We have craft booksand better: we have BLOGS which are electronic places we can access easily andlearn from incredibly good-looking, incredibly smart, writers such as MYSELF,all of those secrets.Typical \"Craft\" book. This is one everyone should own at least several copies of in case someone steals copies... It happens...We also have eventsthese days called WRITER’S CONFERENCES. These are the best places to learnthose secrets that lead to bestsellerdom. Why? Well, because the bestsellingauthors themselves ARE THERE IN PERSON and guess what? They are ALL DRUNK andHANGING OUT IN THE BAR. Where, all you have to do is buy them a Jack and waterand they will share these vital secrets with you! They are all more than happyto do so. They are happy to do anything ifyou only buy them a JACK AND WATER including random sex acts usually availableonly in Juarez, Mexico! Unless, of course, you want to glom onto the secrets ofa romance writer. Then, you need to buy them a drink which has an umbrella init. But, if your ambition is to write gritty, crime and noir novels, then youneed to stick to those manly guys drinking JACK AND WATER. And, romance writersaren’t in the bar anyway. They’re all up in their hotel rooms with otherromance writers DOING VITAL RESEARCH in their vibrating hotel beds. (Nobodyknows where the sci-fi writers are. Best guesses suggest either men’s bathroomsor hanging with the hotel janitor.)The bar is where you'll find famous authors... like Paul D. Brazill!or...These guys...What do you supposeOg, back there in his cave, chiseling out his romance novel of his tryst withMoggy on the cave wall would have given to be able to attend a writer’sconference? A LOT, that’s how much! If only for the vibrating hotel beds. Also,to get away from his wife Zelda, who has just found out about Moggy…And for the umbrelladrinks.For those of you whohave yet to attend a writing conference and are frothing at the mouth to get toone, I’m going to let you in on how they work so that you can maximize yourtime while there and get a whole bunch of writing secrets that will… youguessed it… catapult you into the ranks of BESTSELLERDOM! This is all insidestuff, so pay attention. Plus, it’s guaranteed to get you on the list and beinterviewed by Grit Magazine and the NY Times! Your reviews will consist oforiginal, truly descriptive words like “riveting” and “page-turner” and“brilliant” and “short.” (Well, the last only if you’re Tom Cruise and havejust penned an autobiography.)First of all, youshould probably attend one of the panels. One is plenty. They’re all prettymuch the same and while the organizers seem to put a lot of emphasis on theirwebsites and in their glossy brochures on the panels they’re offering fromBRAND-NAME AUTHORS (a clever synonym for BESTSELLING AUTHORS), like they sayabout Paree: “When you’ve been with one hooker, you’ve been with them all.” No,wait! That’s something else. I meant to say: “When you’ve been to Paree it’shard to go back to the farm and concentrate on fertilizing the soybeans.” NO!That’s not it, either! Dang it. I forget what the saying is, but the gist ofthis is that one panel is all you need to attend. Trust me on this.What will the panelbe about? It will be some guys and gals sitting at a table in front (get thereearly and grab a seat up front as there will always be at least one guy who isconsidered a SERIOUS WRITER who talks really softly and forgets he or she has amicrophone so you’ll want to be close enough to hear him/her when they begin toimpart their secrets. It will be the best secret of all, but the bad news isthat you’ll only be able to make out about every third word as the rest will bedrowned out by thunderous applause whenever his mouth opens or he tugs at anose hair.No matter what thetopic has been labeled, it will always end up being about ADVERBS and whyREALLY SMART WRITERS never use them. Well, hardly ever… Scarcely ever, anyway.Occasionally, at best.This will be the onlything you’ll learn from the panel.Even if thepublicized title of the panel is:DISTINGUISHED PULITZER PRIZE WINNERS TALK ABOUT HOW CREEPINGEXISTENTIALISM AND THE NATIONAL GROSS PRODUCT FIGURES OF 1997 ARE IMPACTING THELITERARY TABLEAU AS EVIDENCED BY THE SCHOLARLY JOTTINGS OF “FIFTY SHADES OFCRAP” AND OTHER POST-MODERN CLASSICS… WITH LOTS OF QUOTES FROM HAROLD BLOOM(Hint: If you don’tknow who Harold Bloom is, you’re in the wrong room. This is why you’re the onlyone here, boobie.)…even if thepublicized title is the above, that part will only take about 43 seconds andthe rest of the panel will be devoted to… you guessed it! ADVERBS. Also, somestuff on what we laughingly call “Writers’ Bumper Stickers of Wisdom.” You’veprobably seen some of these around town on Government Motors (GM) trucks drivenby short, redneck guys who look a lot like TOM CRUISE but with fewer frontteeth (those so-called “smile” teeth). These stickers will be composed of pithy,but true, nuggets of writerly wisdom like: “Show, Don’t Tell.” This means (inliterary language) if you find yourself pregnant by a BRAND NAME AUTHOR, don’ttell on him, or you can kiss goodbye his highly-desired blurb on your tome that isguaranteed to sell a bazillion copies of your opus to people who only buy becauseFrephen Fing (Not his real name—I’m protecting his true identity, out ofrespect.) or Ames Atterson has said it was a “riveting, page-turning, brilliantread… and it’s short.” You’ll be showing, soon enough, and that’s when you canput on the full-court press for his blurb.It’s always a soundidea to visit the bar before attending the panel and, if the organizers of theevent were smart enough to hold it in a civilized city like NEW ORLEANS wherethey have GO-CUPS, take one with you to the panel. If, unluckily it’s in aplace like ALBANY, go early to the bar and drink two more than you normallywould. Ideally, you’ll drink enough that you’ll pass out for the entire lengthof the panel, but even if not, you’ll be able to get through it by realizing:YOU’RE IN FREAKIN’ ALBANY!Albany in the summer during a heat wave...How the hell did thathappen? Wallowing in the misery that comes with knowing you’re spendingperfectly good money to spend a rainy, sleety, windy weekend in FRIGGIN’ ALBANY,the panel won’t suck as much as might have in a really cool place such as… NEWORLEANS! Where you probably won’t bother with panels at all but do the smartthing and just hang out in the bar the entire time.Okay. You got throughthe panel and can breathe a sigh of relief that that’s over and you can tell your wife when you return home thatyou learned “a ton of stuff at this panel I went to.”You might be askingyourself why do obscenely-rich, incredibly handsome, extremely well-hung BRANDNAME AUTHORS (such as myself) deign to even sit on these panels and talk aboutADVERBS.Good question! Itshows… mostly, it shows you aren’t drunk enough yet if you’re thinking thislogically…The answer is thatalthough we’re all OBSCENELY-RICH BEYOND ANYONE’S WILDEST DREAMS, it isn’tthrough the royalties on our BESTSELLING BOOKS. The truth is, we don’t makesquat on those. Are you kidding? It all looks great to the outsider, but thetruth is, as they say, stranger than fiction. Here’s the truth about royalties.Let’s say the booksold a million copies. That’s a lot, right? Well, the joke’s on you if youthink the author himself made very much.First of all, thereare other hands in this pie. (If you think these metaphors and similes orwhatever they are are crap, don’t forget I’m a BESTSELLING AUTHOR and can dothis all day long and you can’t do a thing about it so just shut up and liedown by your dish.)Thank you...To begin with, thepublisher keeps 85% of all the money. Yep. Thas’ right. I didn’t stutter. Thewriter gets to keep 15%. Only he doesn’t.His agent takes 15%off the top. This is to pay him or her back for taking your phone call when youinform him you just sold your book to an editor you just met at the BAR INALBANY. He’ll also do some other valuable work on your behalf when he looksover the contract which basically sells you into servitude for the rest of yournatural life, plus ten years and says, “Yep. Looks good. Sign on that line onthe last page where your full name is printed out above.”Money well spent!Then, the publicisttakes 20%. What, you say? My publicist? Whatif I don’t want no friggin’ publicist? Well, go ahead and don’t have one, buthow do you suppose your book sold a million copies without one? The answer is,there are only 16 people in the world who have Oprah’s private phone number andcan get you booked onto her show which is the only way you CAN SELL A MILLIONFRICKIN’ COPIES OF YOUR STUPID BOOK, btw. And, of those 16 people, 15 ½ arepublicists. (The other one is TOM CRUISE, which is why he gets a half.) So, youneed a publicist. Wake up and smell the pillow, moron! (Smells like drool,doesn’t it?)Then, your agent haspresented you with a great idea. To get the bestseller deal going, he suggestsyou take a portion of your royalties (say, 65%) and sneak into variousbookstores in various disguises… and buy up copies of your own book!It’s a brilliant ideaand you glom onto it instantly! Why? Well, the guy giving you this advice isobviously a GENIUS—after all, he just scammed 15% of your money just byanswering the phone, so he’s already shown you he’s no dummy.All over yourgeographical area, stores are calling into Barnes and Noble regional centers(Barnes and Noble because they’re the only bookstore left) to report thatsales of your opus are “flying off the shelves!” (Bookstore owners use clicheslike this all the time because they mostly read bestsellers and that’s whereall the clichés live.) Barnes and Noble speaks regularly to the NY Times andOprah (they meet at Elaine’s at the table just behind WOODY ALLEN’S), and whenpresented with the news that your opus is flying off the shelves (this is justa highly original way of saying they’re selling a lot and the cashiers arecalling in sick with an outbreak of carpal tunnel syndrome from punching cashregister keys), they say to themselves, “Hey! This is a bestseller! Let’s getit on the list! Let’s book this guy on the show.” (The NY Times says thebestseller thing and Oprah says the show thing. After which, the waiter bringsthem all a round of mimosas and they toast each other for their acumen. TheB and N person is the last one to leave and she gets the bill. Which is addedto your expenses…)There are other folkswho get a piece of your pie. The publisher will want a photograph of you forthe back cover, which you’ll pay for. Your wife’s Kodak moment taken atDisneyland when you rode the Small Cups Ride won’t work. They’ll laughhysterically when you try to foist that one off on them. No, they’ll have tosend out a New York photographer, because everyone knows New York photographersare the only people who know which end to look through and where the littlebutton is to click on a camera.Except, it’s not thatsimple. (You saw this coming, didn’t you…) It never is. It turns out that theNew York photographer is TOO GOOD! Your photograph looks… EXACTLY LIKE YOU!That will never do. This is against tradition. The author’s photograph shouldbe of him (or her, if the author is a woman), but it has to be of him or herfrom thirty years ago and nearly unrecognizeable. That’s why when you went tothe panel, you couldn’t recognize any of the BRAND NAME PANELISTS. None of themlook like their photos. This is why. The photos were all taken at a time whenthey were younger and dumber and full of cu-- (sorry, I forgot this was afamily venue).Who wants to see anold geezer on a book jacket? NO ONE. That’s why they’re always photos takenjust when the author was mustering out of the service just after WWII, stillwearing his bomber jacket and looking jaunty (writer’s word that means… I don’tknow what it means. It means jaunty.Some kind of peppy look, I think. With a crinkly smile.) (See People Magazinecovers…)Like this. Typical People Mag cover... Note the crinkly smile...This means that thepublisher will then request one of your wife’s Kodak moments, taken just beforeyou were married that June day in 1954 and still had all of your teeth. They’llwant the one taken just before youwere married, where you still knew how to smile. WITH ALL OF YOUR TEETH.You’ll learn thatanother massive charge has been marked against your account. They had toPhotoshop the picture (they’ll charge you for the price of the Photoshopprogram itself, btw. You didn’t think those paid for themselves, did you!).You’ll also note in the itemized charges a fee for the guy who manipulated thePhotoshop program to make it look “current.” Which means making the Tiny CupsRide disappear and changing the sepia tones to color. This is done by a guy inthe basement (who writes sci-fi novels).You’ll be amazed atthe skill this guy has brought to the table! Instead of that old photo youremembered, where you threw up seconds after it was shot and where to yourtrained eye you can already detect the glassiness in your stare—now you’relooking at a shot of your old, long-gone self… DIGGING YOUR TOES INTO THE SAND, STARING OUT TO SEA WITH A SOULFUL, DEEP EXPRESSION. Suitable for a People Magazine cover of… TOM CRUISE. In fact, itlooks like almost all photos of TOM CRUISE IN PEOPLE MAGAZINE, except the guyin the picture (you) isn’t short. That’s because it’s shot from ground level,the so-called “power shot.”Anyway, I won’t boreyou (further) with how your royalties all disappear, but will make a long storyshort (I know, I know… it’s too late!), by saying the reason BESTSELLINGAUTHORS and BRAND NAMES do these conventions and sit on panels discussingADVERBS and why you shouldn’t use them even if they do, is because it’s theonly way they can make any money. And, the whole reason they’re there (besidesthe fabulous sums the organizers throw at them), is because there’s always ABAR on the premises.Which is wherethey’ll be when they’re not on their panels. Tip: If you see this woman at the bar and she has a monkey with her, try to avoid her and the monkey or you may end up like the person just above her... Trust me on this...This is the end ofour discussion today on WRITER’S CONVENTIONS. Why? Because all this talk aboutbars has made me thirsty and I crave me a JACK AND WATER.Or maybe a Bud...We’ll pick this upagain (when I feel like it), and talk some about writer’s conventions GROUPIESand how to successfully stalk a BRAND NAME AUTHOR.Until then…happy writing!A few of my groupies, in line to get signed books...Before Ileave you, let me leave you with one valuable piece of advice. If you findyourself at a writer’s convention, and you spot BRAND NAME LEE CHILD, under nocircumstance should you approach him and say the name, TOM CRUISE. He’s a bigguy and trained in some of the more popular martial arts. Just sayin’…Blue skies,LesDISCLAIMER: I was having some fun with Albany, but the truth is it's really a great place! This message wasbrought to you by the publisher of THE RAPIST. Please buy a bunch of copies sothat Les can join the ranks of the BRAND NAME AUTHORS! Remember: Christmas isjust around the corner and what better gift could Granny ever wake up to than acopy of THE RAPIST in her stocking? (The stocking on the mantelpiece, not the oneshe’s wearing…) Just imagine the delight you'll see in her cataracts!See ya at B-Con! Lookfor me in the bar…"},
{"title": "WHAT MISTAKES BUG YOU IN NOVELS?", "date": "Saturday, September 14, 2013", "text": "Hi folks,What are the things thatbug you in novels? Below is a short list of some of the things that bother me.I’d love to hear what irritates you as well.1. When a character in anovel smells “cordite.” All I can figure is that it must be really oldammunition, since cordite hasn’t been manufactured since just after WWII. Kindof hard to believe anything that follows once someone is able to smellsomething that’s been extinct for almost 70 years...2. When a character in asupposedly bad-ass novel uses words like “shiv”. Especially if the character iseither in prison or is an ex-con. The only time I’ve ever heard this term is inold movies like West Side Story or in novels written by people who have neverdone time or been a criminal. In the joint, it’s always “shank” or… simply aknife. When I was in the joint and overheard a newbie using this term, I waspretty sure this is someone new to the criminal life and got his info from badmovies and books. Looks like a guy who isn’t going to do well inside…3. When a character callsprison guards “bulls” or “screws.” Inside, it’s either “hacks” or “guards” or “officer.”“Bulls” and “screws” come from… you know, bad novels and Hollywood… who make alot of their movies from bad novels... The exception is the U.K. where theseterms are still used. And, in novels set in a period before the sixties.4. When a professional—soldieror a cop or other like professional—is having a radio conversation and ends itwith saying, “Over and out.” Anyone who’s been in the service is just naturallygoing to quit believing in anything that author puts on the page thereafter. “Over”means “invitation to transmit” and “Out” means “end of transmission.” They’renever used together, except by writers who’ve never been in the service or lawenforcement and get all their knowledge from reading other bad writers…Probably the same writer who has his characters armed with shivs and sniffscordite… Related, is the character who says “Wilco.” This means “Orderreceived: will comply.” Except, it was a communication ordered not to be usedshortly after WWII.5. The thing I hate theworse though—is that one little paper towel they hand you after they print you.For all the tax dollars citizens send in, you’d think they could give us atleast enough towels to wipe all the ink off… The money sure isn’t being spent onthe food… This one isn’t in novels, but just something that’s personally irritating.There is a reason thewriting advice to “write what you know” is valid. The better advice is “writewhat you can convince the reader you know.” That doesn’t mean the writer has tohave actual experience in whatever world he or she is creating, but it doesmean the writer should have done enough valid research to be factual. And, “validresearch” doesn’t mean relying on other bad novels to figure out what’struthful, but to conduct actual, viable research.There’s a very popularauthor who I can’t read any longer because of his egregious factual errors.Errors which could have been avoided very easily by doing actual research. Whatmakes this guy’s work even worse is that he holds a doctorate and teaches in auniversity. Although, these days that doesn’t mean the guy’s much of a scholar…In a single novel, this guyhad four major mistakes. One would have been bad, but four make him simply andtotally unreliable, at least as far as I’m concerned. The first three wererelated. He had his protagonist/detective pick up a handwritten letter and fromthat deduced that the writer was an elderly, lefthanded man. Well, there arethree things handwriting analysis cannot reveal: Handedness (right or lefthanded writer), age, and sex. This turkey had all three! A phone call to areputable graphologist would have taught him that. And the fourth was perhapsthe worst of all. The protagonist was searching for his girlfriend who had beenmissing for about a year. When he found her body, he also “discovered” that hernails and hair had grown appreciably. By “appreciably” I mean her hair had “grown”almost a foot, and her nails several inches. If he had just asked the averagefifth-grader who’d paid attention in science class, he would have known thathair and nails don’t grow at all after the body dies. This is perhaps theoldest old wives’ tale in existence. Years ago, before embalming, people wouldsometimes dig up bodies and they thought the hair and nails had grown as they “looked”as if they had. Not to the extent this “author” made his gal’s hair and nailsgrow—just a tiny bit. They hadn’t, but they appeared to because the tissues hadshrunk and it made it appear as if they’d grown a tiny bit. If this writer—who hasa doctorate—had just asked a knowledgeable fourth- or fifth-grader who hadn’tslept through science class, he might have avoided embarrassing himself.Although, I doubt if he’d be embarrassed. After all, lots of people buy hisbooks.Not to mention there’sprobably some budding writer out there who may have stumbled upon his book andwill end up going out and writing his own novel and use the info he gleanedthere for his own story. Instead of—you know—doing bona fide research… Ithappens…So, what are the things yousee in novels that just irritate the crap out of you and make you quit readingthe author?Blue skies,Les"},

I'm super-stoked! It's by Daniele Serra, an absolutely brilliant artist.And... without further ado... here it is!It will be released in January, 2014. This novel has a bit of a history. It was originally published by another press, and the owner of that press graciously allowed me back the rights to it. This will be a new read in several ways: There's a new foreword, written by Anthony Neil Smith, and a study guide for it, plus, of course, the new cover.It garnered some awards, being named to the Goodreads list of  The 50 Best Noir Novels and it was a nominee for Spinetingler Magazine's Best Novel, Legends Category. It also won the Preditors&Editors Best Novel Award.It also has some new blurbs by such folks as Anonymous 9 as well as the wonderful ones already given by such luminaries as Linwood Barclay and Allan Guthrie... in fact, a Who's Who lineup of authors who've liked it enough to furnish public praise.I feel that along with THE RAPIST, it's my very best work.I hope you'll consider glomming onto a copy when it comes out!

{"title": "R.I.P. Elmore Leonard", "date": "Tuesday, August 20, 2013", "text": "HI folks,This is a sad, sad day. The genius Elmore Leonard passed away from complications from a stroke. He was 87. I just learned this and my thoughts are flying everywhere. I'm incoherent and profoundly saddened.Leonard was one of the \"good guys\" in literature. He inherited that \"built-in bullshit detector\" from Hemingway. His work was so strong, so honest, so brilliant. The very clearest of  vision.My favorite of his books is KILLSHOT. It's also the only one that Hollywood didn't pervert when they made it into a movie. Hollywood saw most of his work--especially in the last twenty years--as broad comedy, rather than the black comedy he actually wrote. He said the same thing himself. He kept offering up a particular actor who he wanted to play the lead in many of his movies--sorry, can't remember the name but my friend Carl Brush does--Carl? Who was the actor Leonard always wanted? Once you see who he always wanted, you understand his books a lot better.The movie they made of KILLSHOT was frickin' pitch-perfect. Again, I don't know who the director was, but he understood Leonard. And the casting director also understood him. They picked Mickey Rourke to be the lead and Rourke is the perfect choice for a Leonard character. Which is why it went direct-to-video, I suspect. It was too dark for the suits in Hollywood who don't much get black comedy. They don't usually see the difference between that and broad comedy.I don't have a bunch of clips and photos--sorry!--but just a recommendation. If you haven't read KILLSHOT, get a copy and read it. It doesn't get any better than this.Blue skies,Les"},
{"title": "LINWOOD BARCLAY'S NEW NOVEL--A TAP ON THE WINDOW", "date": "Friday, August 16, 2013", "text": "Hi folks,One of my all-time favoriteauthors is internationally-bestselling Canadian Linwood Barclay, who writestruly amazing thrillers. In fact, I recommend his work to my novel-writingstudents and clients as one of the best examples of how a writer createstension on every single page… which he always does.My only complaint of him asa writer is that he doesn’t write nearly fast enough! My preference would befor him to come out with a new novel each week, but I guess that isn’t toofeasible…What that means is thatwhen he does come out with a new one, I’m all over it, like sweat on a marathonrunner. And, I know to never begin a Barclay novel at night. Not unless I planto stay up until the sun rises…Well, he finally came out with a new one! A TAPON THE WINDOW. And this one is his best sofar!I’m not good at writingplot summaries so I’ll just rely on the Amazon copy for that:It’s been two months since private investigator Cal Weaver’steenage son Scott died in a tragic accident. Ever since, he and his wife havedrifted apart, fracturing a once normal life. Cal is mired in grief, a grief hecan’t move past. And maybe his grief has clouded his judgment. Because drivinghome one night, he makes his first big mistake.A girl drenched in rain taps on his car window and asks for a ride as he sitsat a stoplight. Even though he knows a fortysomething man picking up a teenagehitchhiker is a fool, he lets her in. She’s the same age as Scott, and maybeshe can help Cal find the dealer who sold his son the drugs that killed him.After a brief stop at a roadside diner, Cal senses that something’s not rightwith the girl or the situation. But it’s too late. He’s already involved.Now Cal is drawn into a nightmare of pain and suspicion. Something is horriblywrong in the small town of Griffon in upstate New York. There are too manysecrets there, too many lies and cover-ups. And Cal has decided to expose thosesecrets one by one.That’s his second big mistake.What I bring to the tablefor your consideration is that I really couldn’t put this down! It’s like everyone of Linwood’s novels—drenched with tension and blow-by-blow it just keepsratcheting up--you simply can’t quit reading. It can be used as a textbook forwriters who want to learn the very best techniques of creating tension on everypage… and it can be read by readers who like their books to be riveting andkeep them on the edge throughout the entire novel.Bad things happen. Lots andlots of bad things. And the ending is so damned powerful. This is by far hisdarkest novel.For me, there was an addedbonus. Part-way through the read, I came upon my own name! Well, not exactly myentire name. A character named Len Edgerton. Just one sentence that says:If that happens, if we geta few more complainants—in fact, this kid said he knew of at least one otherperson, by the name of Len Edgerton or Eggleton or something—well, that mightplay out very differently.Well, Linwood and I arekind of friends—in fact, he gave me a great blurb for THE BITCH which comes outin January from New Pulp Press, so I had an inkling that maybe he’d chosen thisname on purpose. So, I emailed him. Here’s our exchange:Me, to Linwood (we’d beentalking about Bouchercon and Thrillerfest and he’d told me he wouldn’t be ableto make Bouchercon, but would be at Thrillerfest)I hope to make Thrillerfest.BTW, I see you've got a minor character named \"Len Edgerton.\" Justwondering... :)To which, Linwood replied (succinctly)Yup.And I answered:OHMYGOD! That's all I cansay! I'm already your biggest fan--now I'm your WAY-BIGGEST FAN.And Linwood came back with: I'd forgotten about that. I was castingabout for a name one day and must have seen something you posted on FB, andthought, that'll do, but I can't do the name exactly the same, so I changed aletter.Don't sue.To which I said:Sue?! I'm so tickled pink I can't seestraight. Thank you! Although, if that would have been me, I would've gottenthe guy over the rail and into the river... :)(That last was about what this character did,later on in the novel.)So there you have it. Inside “skinny” on how Iended up in a frickin’ Linwood Barclay novel!I have no doubt that this will help make it abestseller.No doubt at all.You’ll wanna get this puppy. It’s one of thebest I’ve read in a long time. And I read a lot.Blue skies,Les"},

{"title": "MONDAY'S MEAL story collection", "date": "Thursday, August 8, 2013", "text": "Hi folks,(Warning: This is a long one!) Recently, Court Merrigan, a writer friend of mine and I were in contactabout his master’s thesis in which he was writing a chapter on “country noir.”I recommended my good friend Jane Bradley’s work to him and then thought aboutsome of my own work, which I also suggested he take a look at.Specifically, my first collection of short stories, titledMONDAY’S MEAL, from the university of North Texas Press, pub. 1997. I consider this probably my best work, along with THERAPIST and the forthcoming THE BITCH.The reason I’m talking about it here, is that I know a lotof folks may not be aware of this book and I’m taking this opportunity to makeyou aware of it. Other than selling copies, I have another, ulterior motive forbringing this book to your attention. A publisher is interested in the reprintrights to it, but when I contacted the editor at UNT, he told me that theywouldn’t release those rights to me until it was completely sold out. Well,since there’s only a very few copies left in the warehouse, I thought I’d letyou know and if enough people buy up the remaining copies, it can see new life…and that would make me ecstatic! Plus, I think you’ll find it to be a read you’llenjoy.Here’s what the NYTimes had to say about Monday’s Meal:The New York TimesNovember 16,1997By DENISE GESSThe sad wives, passive or violent husbands, parolees,alcoholics and other failures in Leslie H. Edgerton's short-story collectionare pretty miserable people. And yet misery does have its uses. Raymond Carverelevated the mournful complaints of the disenfranchised in his work, andEdgerton makes an admirable attempt to do the same. He brings to this task anunerring ear for dialogue and a sure-handed sense of place (particularly NewOrleans, where many of the stories are set). Edgerton has affection for evenhis most despicable characters -- ''boring'' Robert, who pours scalding waterover his sleeping wife in ''The Last Fan''; Jake, the musician responsible forhis own daughter's death in ''The Jazz Player''; and Tommy in ''I Shoulda Seena Credit Arranger,'' whose plan to get hold of some money involves severing thearm of a rich socialite -- but he never quite takes the reader past the brinkof horrible fascination into a deeper understanding. In the best story, ''MyIdea of a Nice Thing,'' a woman named Raye tells us why she drinks: ''My job.I'm a hairdresser. See, you take on all of these other people's personalities andtroubles and things, 10 or 12 of 'em a day, and when the end of the day comes,you don't know who you are anymore. It takes three drinks just to sort yourselfout again.'' Here Edgerton grants both the reader and Raye the grace of irony,and without his authorial intrusion, we find ourselves caring about herpredicament. Here’s what some other reviewers had to say:“Those who enjoy reading Stephen King or watching TheTwilight Zone will eat up these unique, often gruesome, at times humorous,short stories.” --School Library Journal“This collection of short fiction by the author of TheDeath of Tarpons contains considerable variety of tone, voice, and subjectmatter, but the majority of the stories fall into two distinct groups. A largenumber of stories focus on troubled and deeply self-absorbed men who seemsurprised to find themselves in failed romantic relationships. A number ofother stories focus on marginal Pulp Fiction types who are haunted bypersonal demons and are drawn to violence. In stories that range in tone fromthe comic and farcical to the darkly tragic and grim, Edgerton draws memorableportraits of these dangerous and unpredictable characters.” --LibraryJournalLeslie H. Edgerton's new collection fully meets John Updike's explanation ofwhy we read short stories: \"Each is a glimpse into another country: anoccasion for surprise, an excuse for wisdom, and an argument for charity.\"The country of Edgerton's stories, in geographic terms, is New Orleans and theTexas Gulf Coast. In human terms, Edgerton's territory is peopled by nightclubmusicians, cafe owners, teenage delinquents, inmates and ex-cons, the poor anduneducated, the heartless and violent, and a snooty former debutante.Monday's Meal is a busy collectionof twenty-one stories. A handful of these include recurring characters,enhancing the sense throughout the book that Edgerton is writing about acommunity rather than simply a series of individuals. The character with whomwe become best acquainted is Evan, a.k.a. Pete: \"Now Pete's not my realname, it's my middle name. Peter, actually. But when your first name's Evan,and you hang out where I do, you want to use something else.\" Evan/Petehangs out in the seedier precincts of New Orleans. In \"I Shoulda Seen aCredit Arranger\" and \"Ten Cents a Dance,\" he gets involved in,respectively, a botched kidnapping and the pursuit of an uninterestedprostitute. His ex-wife, the blueblood narrator of \"Princess,\" findsit horrific how he now \"hangs out with low-lifes, even street people.God!\" Evan/Pete, though, is a street-wise, philosophizing,get-by-as-best-you-can kind of guy who moves through a part of New Orleansnever viewed from the tour bus.Evan/Pete is an amusing character, yet not all of Edgerton's down-and-outers are. \"The Jazz Player\" portrays an angry young man desperateto release \"that intense, throbbing, terrible, last blast of pent-up furyand frustration and guilt and anguish and loss and death.\" In \"TheMockingbird Cafe,\" one of the strongest stories here for its concision, ablack prison escapee endures a white cop's tormenting of him and then sullenlywalks away. In \"Rubber Band,\" a kid just released from thereformatory, made cynical and weary of the world, anticipates his own snappingpoint. While Edgerton can sketch a city hardship scene comparable to JosephMitchell's--and several of the stories have the casualness of familiar essaysabout them--Edgerton establishes the kind of convincing, and wrenching, interioritywith his characters achieved by only the most adept fiction writers.Edgerton does not write exclusively about people living on society's fringe.Sometimes his characters--as in \"The Last Fan,\" about a dullardhusband's violent turn, or \"Voodoo Love,\" about a yuppie couple'sfalling out--are simply headed in that direction. To his credit, Edgerton aimsfor range in his characters. While suspicion of identity interlopers acrossethnic and gender lines is often justified, the smart writer adopts variouspersonae in order to strive for empathy and understanding, rather thanappropriation. \"My Idea of a Right Thing\" exemplifies this purpose inits striking account of a woman's struggle with alcoholism and the (often)predominantly male world of Alcoholics Anonymous. Less dramatic, though no lessvivid, \"Telemarketing\" is the story of a woman dealing with anemotionally distant husband and a pair of needy neighbors as she runs the cafeshe owns and longs to have a child.Even Edgerton's most harrowing stories, such as \"Hard Times,\"about the deadly abandonment of a woman and her children, read effortlessly.The prose throughout is vibrant and precise. At times, the author's sharp earfor colloquial mannerisms tends to turn his speakers into Runyonesque caricatures,as when the high-brow belle in \"Princess\" exclaims indignantly,\"Why, I'd just die!\" On the other hand, such dialect adds as muchlocal color as references to the Camellia Cafe or beignets. A case in point:after protesting how he was \"bum-rapped on that litigious,\" thenarrator of \"Dream Flyer\" gripes about the \"effrippery\" ofhis jailers for putting him in the same cell with an\"orignal-diginal\" like the Dream Flyer, who's scheduled to be\"exterminated for something he didn't do.\" In fiction as in life, Isuppose, better too much of a good thing than not enough.Once again, the University of North Texas Press deserves high praise for itscommitment to publishing superb contemporary fiction. Leslie H. Edgerton is awriter one should continue to seek out in the literary magazines and on thenew-releases shelf.Studiesin Short Fiction, Summer, 1997, by PeterDonahue, Sam Houston StateUniversityCOPYRIGHT 1997 Studies in Short FictionCOPYRIGHT 2004 Gale GroupOn Amazon, it garnered nine reviews, all five stars:1 of 1 people found the following review helpful 5.0 out of 5 stars Thoughtsof Raymond Carver, January 22, 2013 By Sarah Faurote - Seeall my reviewsThis review is from: Monday's Meal (Paperback) As I read Les Edgerton's Monday's Meal, I couldn't help butthink of one of my favorite American short story writers - Raymond Carver.

Flannery O' Connor, Raymond Carver, Stephen King,Dorothy Parker, Charles Bukowski, Richard Ford, Kyle Minor. Loads and loadsmore.And you can add Les Edgerton to that list.Monday's Meal by Leslie H Edgerton was published in 1997 and containstwenty-one tales of dirt realism. Sharp slices of American life. They're set inNew Orleans and Texas. Sometimes in bars or behind bars. They're about caféowners, hairdressers, nightclub musicians, prisoners, ex-cons, drifters anddrinkers.Monday's Meal opens and closes `Blue Skies' and `Monday's Meal, tales ofstrained relationships.' But the real meat is sandwiched between them. AndMonday's Meal is particularly meaty.Some favourites: `The Mockingbird Café' is the story of a man in a low-rent bartrying to mind his own business; `Hard Times' is bleak and scary andbrilliantly written; `The Last Fan' is a tragic look at a shattered marriage;`My Idea Of A Nice Thing' is a touching and sad story of an alcoholic'scrumbling life;'Telemarketing,' is the story of a young couple just trying toget by; `I Shoulda Seen a Credit Arranger,' is a Runyonesque crime story.And there's plenty more to enjoy in Monday's Meal. Edgerton has a strong andsure grasp of the lives of people who are standing on the edge of a precipice.3 of 3 people found the following review helpful 5.0 out of 5 stars Thesestories are classics, April 17, 1999 By wbanks@pomona.edu (California) - Seeall my reviewsThis review is from: Monday's Meal (Paperback) When I finished the last story in Monday's Meal I paused,reflected, and then read it right through again from the beginning. Part of thereason for my re-reading was a simple desire to repeat the pleasure; part of itwas a desire to understand what made these elegantly constructed stories tick.Just where was I drawn from a realistic beginning into the banishment of theordinary - the strange, ordinary world that some of these stories inhabit? Justwhere is the edge in these finely drawn personalities, the edge that leads tothe end? One can also learn from these stories. The craft, the amazing economydeserve study, but one can just go along for the ride and enjoy. I wouldcompare some of the plots to Ray Carver's in their structure, but Edgerton hasit all over Carver in his depiction of personality. Edgerton's people havedepth, they are all different, and the actions flow entirely from theirnatures. This is a collection not to be missed. 3 of 4 people found the following review helpful 5.0 out of 5 stars Edgertonis the last of the Great American Authors, February 19, 1999 By Vincent Zandri (New York) - Seeall my reviewsThis review is from: Monday's Meal (Paperback) This collection will grab you by the heart and wrench itright out of your chest. The characters are hauntingly authentic as are the NewOrleans and South Texas settings they inhabit. These are deeply troubledindividuals coping with other troubled individuals who find solace only in thebottle and the arid soil underneath the soles of their battered Tony Lamas.Edgerton reigns as a supreme American author. A sort of Ray Carver meets DenisJohnson. A literary man who succeeds where the academics fail--he knows plot,he knows story, he knows action! The last of a great breed that includesHemingway, Mailer and Jim Harrison. It's simple.

What we meet there are the peoplewe have avoided all our lives. What we find is the human heart, its brightnessand dark corners. And we leave and return to the same world we have alwaysknown, but it doesn't look the same.

This review is from: Monday's Meal (Paperback) Monday's Meal is a collection of hard hitting shortstories. If the reader is looking for a pleasant diversion, look elsewhere. Ifthe reader wishes to be challenged to think about life and it's manycomplexities then choose Monday's Meal.\"It's Different\" is thisreviewer's favorite selection from the book. At first glance this seems likesuch a simple tale, but the story stayed with this reader long after the book'scovers were closed. Monday's Meal is a book one will read again and again. There is an added bonus tothis book. The fantastic art of Lu Ann Barrow. There’s a great story behindthis cover. During its publication, my publisher, Fran Vick, and her crew,including my editor, Charlotte Wright, couldn’t come up with a cover idea theyliked. Then, one day as she was leaving for the office, Fran happened to glanceat a painting she owned hanging in the foyer of her home. It was a painting by theacclaimed artist Lu Ann Barrow, titled Rain Dance. “This is perfect,” she said.As it happens, Fran knew Ms. Barrow personally and took a chance and calledher, asking what it would cost to use her art for the cover. To her amazement,Ms. Barrow graciously said she could use it gratis!It was perfect.Today, short storycollections are easily published due to the ebook phenomena. In those days, itwas very difficult to get a collection published by a legitimate publisher. The“rules” were that at least half of the stories had to have been previouslypublished by prestigious literary magazines. The other rule was that there hadto be a theme that connected all the stories. Well, I’d satisfied the firstrequirement—every one of the stories had been published by some of the bestlitmags out there—places like The SouthCarolina Review, High Plains Literary Review, Kansas Quarterly/Arkansas Review,Whiskey Island Review and others. One story subsuquently appeared inHoughton-Mifflin’s “Best American Mystery Stories.” But… there really wasn’t atheme to them. They represented a variety of subjects, voices, themes. To climbover that obstacle, I came up with the idea of titling it “Monday’s Meal.”That came from the Southerntradition of Monday’s being wash days. The deal was, every Monday, the wife didthe weekly washing… while also tending to the ten kids she had, her husband,the house cleaning, and all of the other chores, including feeding her brood.Eventually, a common meal emerged. Usually, it was a form of either stew orgumbo. Something that could be put on the stove and when she had a few extraminutes, she could run in and throw in a new ingredient. The gumbo cooked allday long. The ingredients thrown into the pot were all over the place. At firstglance, it didn’t look as if they’d go together, but at the end of the day theyall combined to create a wonderful, delicious dish. In our house, we always hadgumbo and one of the best ingredients (in season) was when my grandma put incrab eggs. I gave the collection the name of Monday’s Meal to indicate a kindof gumbo where a bunch of unrelated ingredients came together to create a tastymeal.Personally, I felt it was areally neat idea… and so did Fran and Charlotte.Which was why Lu Ann Barrow’spainting was so perfect. It shows a poor family, cavorting in a sudden summershower in front of their shack. In the background, you can see the family washon a clothesline. It’s the women of the family (the father was at his work),along with the family dogs. There’s even an old-fashioned washing machine onthe porch.It was… absolutely perfect.Almost as if Lu Ann Barrow had painted it just for this book!Anyway, it’s a cover thatthe publisher could never have afforded but that we were able to get because ofthe largesse of Ms. Barrow. When you buy the book, you also get a cover of anincredible work of art.One more “inside” bit ofinfo. One of the stories is one I wrote when I was 12 years old and when it waspublished both by a literary magazine and in this collection, not a word waschanged from that early version. The first three who can guess which story itis, I’ll send a copy of my newest novel, THE RAPIST to—either the ebook versionor the paperback—your choice. Post your guesses here in the Comments.Okay. Infomercial over.Hope you glom onto a copy so UNT sells out and I can get back the rights andreissue it as both an ebook and paperback.Thanks for considering it!Blue skies,LesAnd, thanks for your support and helping make me a happy camper!(What a happy camper looks like in the wild...)"},

First, the best interview I’ve everhad the pleasure of being involved in was published in Grift Magazine Issue #2.Then, Benoit Lelievre posted a terrific review of my novel JUST LIKE THAT in his online magazine The Deadend Follies.And then… Frank Nowatzke, publisher of the German publishingimprint, Pulpmaster, who had earlier purchased the German rights to THE RAPIST,made me an offer to publish the German language rights of THE RAPIST and alsomade an offer to publish first rights (in German) of my black comedy crimecaper, THE GENUINE, IMITATION, PLASTIC KIDNAPPING. And now, Italian publisher Matteo Strukul has requested a copy of THE RAPIST for consideration for publishing theItalian rights. And, another German publisher, Dr. Thomas Wortche of PenserPulp, has requested several of my manuscripts and is reading them now andconsidering publication. Viva Europe!  I’d like to give a BIG SHOUT-OUT to a good friend of mine,Jack Getze, and his novel, BIG NUMBERS. This is one of the most enjoyablehard-boiled detective novels I’ve read in a long, long time. “Page-turner” isan adjective used perhaps too much in describing novels, but in this case itapplies. It’s also genuinely funny and will remind you of Carl Hiassen’s novels.I highly, highly recommend it. It’s also a product of an exciting publisher, Down and Out Books, run by Eric Campbell. I met Eric at the last Boucherconwhen he came to a reading of noir authors and what he’s doing with his press isresurrecting deserving novels that are out-of-print that he feels deserve to beresurrected. He’s putting together a kick-ass list of books like Jack’s.And, finally, I’ve been asked to and have acceptedinvitations to appear at two writer’s conferences next May in Texas. Being anative Texan (born in Odessa and raised in Freeport), I’m really stoked to begoing home! Also, I get to meet up with some good friends of mine, Bob Stewartand Carl Brush and some others.The first event will be the Dallas-FT. Worth Writer’s Conference held May 2-4 at the Hurst Conference Center, Hurst, TX (Dallas). Sofar, besides myself, old friend, uber-agent Don Maass is appearing and theheadliner is best-selling novelist Jonathan Maberry. The director, Kirk von derHeydt,  awarethat “Les likes his Jack Daniels,” told me that each presenter is assigned whatthey call a “wrangler”--a person who gets them places and escorts them around,and that he assigned me a guy who always carries a flask with him since the bardoesn’t open until 7:30. Seven-thirty!? What th?! Is this Texas? Anyway, it’llbe lots of fun so hope some of you can make it and we get to meet. After 7:30you’ll find me… well, you know where…Then, I come back home for a few days and then go back down again toSan Antonio, where I’ll be appearing at my third Writer’s Retreat Workshop(WRS) for director Jason Sitzes. These are intensive 10-day affairs and a totalblast! I was privileged to teach at two earlier ones when theywere held in Kentucky and they were fantastic. I’m planning on hooking up withseveral of my writer friends, including Bob Stewart, Carl Brush, and SusanBaker. And old friends from when I appeared a few years ago. People tend to goback to WRW, over and over. It’s an amazing retreat and will run from May 9-18 2014 in SanAntonio, TX., at the Purple Sage Ranch. It's going to be one of the mostfabulous venues yet. I can’t wait and I hope we’ll get to go down to theRiverwalk—it’s one of my favorite places in America!Finally, I've received emails from folks who tell me they can't find my novel THE BITCH on Amazon. Well... that's because I've taken back the rights from the original publisher and sold the book to New Pulp Press and it will be coming out anew in January in both paperback and in ebook format. It will also be coming out in a German edition in paper and ebook from Pulpmaster. Sorry for the inconvenience but I'm really excited about the new publisher and the edition that will come out. There's be new material in it as well--including a foreword and a reader's guide. Welp…thas’ about it!Blueskies,LesMe reading at the Noir at the Bar event in Cleveland at the last Bouchercon where I met Eric Campbell of Down and Out Books."},

I’m very proud to be included.Grift #2 is available now!Posted by Johnon July 14th, 2013 The secondissue of Grift is now available!Believeme, it was worth the wait. The issue includes an exhaustive (yet incrediblycaptivating) interview of Les Edgerton, another with Stuart Neville, and a looka the film noir woodcuts of Loren Kantor.Thefiction section is beefed up considerably from the first issue with storiesfrom Erik Arneson, Jack Bates, Matthew Brozik, Lawrence Buentello, Holly Day,Salvatore Falco, Andy Henion, Davin Ireland, David James Keaton, Jon McGoran,Chad Rohrbacher, Helen Maryles Shankman, and Martin Zeigler.Getit here.The second is the highly-regarded blog by Ben Lelievre, Dead End FolliesDead End Follies Wednesday, July 17, 2013Book Review : Les Edgerton - Just Like That (2012) Benoit Lelievre(also reviewed)OrderTHE RAPIST here\"Jake\"I said,\"Huh?\"\"You gotthree weeks, huh.\"He was talkingabout my parole hearing. \"That's right\"\"You'll beback, Jake. I can guarantee it.\"Everybody always says that. It's jealousy, that's all it is.If you've followed mycoverage of the release of LesEdgerton's THE RAPIST, you know he's an unusual creature in the crime fiction landscape.He is half-writer, half-character. Your run-of-the-mill writer could neverimagine a character who has lived through what Les lived. I know what you'rethinking. This calls for a memoir, right? Well, Edgerton has one...or he almostdoes. JUSTLIKE THAT is many things. It's a novel, first and foremost, but it's also amemoir, a thinly-veiled true crime book and a user guide to separate what'sreal from what's bullshitin today mainstream fiction portrayal of prison environment.Fortunately, it's also a pretty good story.JUST LIKE THATdoesn't really have a beginning or an end, dramatically speaking. It's not aconstruction, built from a series of events, that reaches a confrontationalboiling point. It's just a chunk of time in protagonist Jake Mayes' life where he was in andout of prison. Edgerton mentions in the foreword that several parts of thenovel were published as short stories and it shows. Every chapter is sowell-defined, it could be a story in itself. Better yet, I'm sure some couldcraft a novel using one of JUST LIKE THAT'schapters as an inspiration prompt. Since every chapter/stories share the sameprotagonist and that they are in chronological order, it works fine as a novelalso.You could call JUST LIKE THATmetafiction,I suppose. The foreword and the afterword are an integral part of the novel'senjoyment as Edgerton explain most of this kind of happened and he refuses totell you what's realand what's fiction. That gives the reader perspective on his own crime fiction cultureand adds a layer of fun to the reading process as you're always trying to guesswhere is the line between reality and fiction. Reading JUST LIKE THATis an active process. It's not a story that delivers itself to youstraightforwardly. It's something that's anchors in reality, in Les Edgerton's persona, andfinishes on the pages of the novel. Yeah, I guess it's crime metafiction after all.\"You ever getscared?\"\"Well,there's time's when I'm more cautious than others if that's what youmean.\"\"Fuck it,Jake. I'm askin' you a serious question. You ever been scared ofanything?\"Before I couldanswer and maybe because he really wanted an answer and knew I wouldn't admitit - having fear, that is - he said, \"I been scared most of my life, Jake.You believe that?\"There are a lot of quiet, almostintimate moments to JUST LIKE THAT,which were my favorite parts (see what I just quoted). Parts where Edgertonseems to break the fourth wall and explain his philosophy on things himself. Ihave never seen the borderline animalistic nature of the criminal spiritexplained so well. That surrender to your darkest impulses of destruction. Itsets the tone for the whole novel, which is light on outward emotion, but notwithout a heart. That's just how I like fiction. Seldom tender, but nevermushy. Male friendship is also a strong theme in JUST LIKE THAT,the peculiar, reticent way men show appreciation towards one another and sticktogether. You can't really put an etiquetteon JUST LIKETHAT. Just stick it it on the mystery section shelves of your bookstore andlet the readers make up their mind. Les Edgerton often says hewent to the JackLondon School of Writing, so it makes JUST LIKE THAThis master degree thesis. No matter how you want to call it : metafictional, autobiographical, picaresque or criminal, it'smostly a great story about being a human being in the darkest corners ofAmerica. It's not anything precise, yet it's not difficult to love. Posted by Benoit LelievreThanks, Ben!\"JUST LIKE THAT is yet another  Les Edgerton winner. Mr. Edgerton in his prison memoir conjures up in honest, Bukowski-esque prose a mad dog life lived behind and beyond the bars of institutional correctional facilities. Literature's version of Johnny Cash, America has yet another gifted bard to sing the blues of time served.I have long believed Mr. Edgerton to be an American original, who has for too long remained one of our best-kept literary secrets. As a publisher I want to put to print whatever he writes, as a reader I want to devour the pages, as a writer, I'd be happy to pilfer just a few of his lines.\"-Cortright McMeel, author of Short (St. Martin's), Co-publisher, Bare Knuckles Press, Co-editor, Noir National, International Journal of Crime FictionBlue skies,Les"},

Not because it isn't written brilliantly, and not because it ever gets boring. The protagonist is Truman Ferris Pinter who is a psychopath, no kidding with this. It is stomach turning how this guy rationalizes, and harrowing. I really HATE him, but I could not put it down. And the fact that I would put \"hate\" in all caps is what makes this brilliant. I read a lot, and one out of every 100 novels affects me the way this has. It was beyond the mediocre character villains, the clichés that allow you to sit back and think, \"cardboard character\" I'm just along for the ride. No, you get so involved with this, that you have an emotional reaction on the visceral level.I have only read 2 other novels that stayed with me to this extent, \"The Handmaid's Tale\" and \"Lolita\". They stayed with me for months, and even years. This one is going to do the same.It is powerful. Read it.Thanks! Much appreciated!Blue skies,Les"},

{"title": "Literary Sex...", "date": "Saturday, June 15, 2013", "text": "Hi folks,Got a bit of a treat for you today. My good friend andcolleague, author Carl Brush has written an essay on “Literary Sex” which Ithought you’d find interesting. Carl and I have been friends for many years andsince he lives in Oakland, CA, he’s my source for everything S.F. Giants.Whenever they win the World Series… like twice in the last three years (hearthat, Dodger fans?), he sends my son Mike and I all the newspaper accounts andpictures. Thanks, Carl!Here’s Carl’s thoughts on sex on the page…LITERARY SEX—A GUIDETO THE PROMISED LANDByCarl BrushSo your characters are in love, orat least lust, and you’ve brought them to thatpoint. What’s next? Maybe a stream of moans and groans and slurps and visionsof bodies contorted into circusy gyrations? Or how about the tender embracefollowed by the gently-lowered curtain with violins in the background? Or willit be something in between? Pun intended.Part of the answer depends on yourstory’s genre. If it’s erotica, you probably need to go for the liquid gold.However, I’m neither the audience nor the writer to talk to about that. I haveno moral objection, and I have read some erotica with interestingcharacters/plots. It’s just that when I get to the carnality parts, I findmyself skating on by to find out what happens next in the tale. I’m much moreinterested in how to make the lovemaking scenes, both exciting in themselves andpart of the overall development of action and character. You don’t have to go far to find acouple of superb examples. Les Edgerton’s ThePerfect Crime contains one of the most erotic scenes I’ve ever read, yet there’snary a salacious detail. Our intrepid hero and his lady are on a stakeout in anapartment so empty it’s bereft of furniture or carpeting, and they’re directlyabove the apartment of their quarry.  Asingle sound will reveal their presence, leading to serious injury or death, aswell as the foiling of their mission. Yet, their brand-new relationship isheating up and is on the brink of the big it.Thus, their decision to yield to their impulses is not only in character, notonly crucial to the plot, but is triply erotic because of their need forabsolute silence during the act. Mine is a second-hand description, and theexperience is in reading Les’s masterful writing, but I trust I’ve made mypoint about the merging of the lovemaking with character, action, and story.Staying with Les for a moment,let’s turn to Just Like That, inwhich the narrator undergoes a male-on-male rape. This time, Les gives us prettymuch every in and out and back and forth of the physical event. However, theway he writes it, the main focus is still not the sex so much as the razorthat’s poised at Jake’s neck during it. In terms of both action and character,the dramatic tension for the reader comes from wondering if Jake can or willfight back. So action, character, sex all at once, not separate elements.Of course, both the examples I’vegiven are from what the critics might call “gritty” crime novels, and one mightassume it’s easier to accomplish such intertwining there than in lighter fare.Well, let me introduce you to a couple of historical thrillers and demonstratethat it ain’t necessarily so.My “Vendetta Duo,” the recentlyreleased The Maxwell Vendetta and itssequel The Second Vendetta take placein 1908-10 San Francisco and the nearby Sierra Nevada mountains amid more “proper”surroundings than Les’s settings. Nevertheless, the course of young love cannotbe denied, and I didn’t find it necessary to deprive readers of a share in theproceedings by doing a fadeout when the going got hot and heavy. Andy’s been pursuing Virginia for along time, and the reader (I hope) is wishing he’d just forge past herobviously insincere denials. Finally, in her artist’s studio, the time seemsright. His jealousy aroused by the drawing of a nude male model tacked to herwall, Andy strips and assumes poses such as the David, then invites her tofollow suit. She’s tempted, but demurs, giggling about his circumcision(unusual for the times) and his awkward positions. He’s made a bit of a fool ofhimself and is still a long way from home plate with Virginia. End of scene.Failure? Not so. Delay. And we know how tantalizing that can be. Andy’s clumsy effortsprove endearing and, in the end, effective. Consummation follows not long after.I don’t provide more graphic description, though. After all, we’ve already seenthe goods, so we can vicariously join the proceedings while Andy gets hisromantic groove on. Thus, action, character, sex. All at once. With a bit ofthe comical thrown in for good measure—always welcome and sadly missing fromnovels these days, I think.There are other sex scenes in the Vendettas, scenes I intend to arouse thereader without much play-by-play but still juicy. I guess I prefer my literarysex to be more like a Japanese painting in which thespace is as important as the object. After all, what’s the strip without thetease?About Carl BrushCarl Brush has been writing sincehe could write, which is quite a long time now. He grew up and lives inNorthern California, close to the roots of the people and action of his historicalthrillers, the recently-released The MaxwellVendetta, and its sequel, The Second Vendetta.A third volume of the trilogy, set in pre-gold-rush San Francisco isnearing completion.

{"title": "HUGE RECOMMEND FOR RICHARD GODWIN'S \"ONE LOST SUMMER\"", "date": "Friday, June 14, 2013", "text": "Hi Folks, When I was asked to provide a blurb for Richard Godwin’snew novel, ONE LOST SUMMER, I gladly agreed. I’m a huge fan of his work andlooked forward to another great read. Well, I’ve finished it and. I know nowthat whatever I say about this brilliant novel will be less than it deserves.This is without a doubt one of the best novels I’ve read ina long, long time. All the while I was turning the pages, it didn’t feel like Iwas reading but more akin to a physical sensation, like floating on water. And…a particular, unique body of water. I felt myself buoyed up and borne along asin a small raft, floating on an azure sea, not a cloud in the cobalt-blue,brittle ether above me, helpless and alone. For one of the few times in my life,I understand what the term “fictive dream” meant.This is the perfect example of a “Jungian novel.” It’s awork of the shadow world that inhabits the deepest recess of the human mind andpsyche. I’m not going to talk here about the plot. Yes, there is a plot butthis is more than a plot and a character and stuff going on. This is a dreamand you don’t read it; you experience it the same as you do whenyou find yourself in a dream and know you’re in a dream, but just as it is whenyou’re in a fugue state,  helpless andbeing carried along to where you don’t know until Godwin deposits you there.It’s frightening to be under control like you are by the author, and, at thesame time, exhilarating, as the thought first creeps into your mind and thenfirmly asserts itself, that you are in the presence of greatness and you feelalmost unworthy of being there. This is a work of mad genius. And, make nomistake, you are in the presence of true literature.Godwin has given us a clear and prescient look inside themind of a madman and how that madness begins and blossoms and how the madmanfinally gains complete control of his insanity. This is T.S. Eliot’s “The WasteLand” delivered in a contemporary play. Pay attention to the names of thecharacters and the locales as they provide the keys to understanding thisnovel. This novel is a paean to the “lost generation” and should, but won’t,become the anthem for these souls. Most scholars admit to not knowing exactlywhat Eliot had in mind when he wrote his poem, but I think Godwin has comecloser than anyone.This is a novel I will read again and again, but I confessI plan to wait at least six months between each reading as I won’t be able towork for awhile after reading it. It will discourage me too much as I know I’llfear I can’t begin to approach its magnificence as a writer and that isparalyzing.Kudos to Godwin—he has achieved a masterpiece!From the promo:Rex Allen loves star quality in women. Hemoves into a new house in a heat wave with few possessions apart from twophotographs of his dead daughter. His next door neighbour, beautiful EvangelineGlass invites him to one of her many summer parties, where he meets her friendsand possessive husband Harry. Rex feels he knows Evangeline intimately. Hestarts to spy on her and becomes convinced she is someone other than who shepretends to be. When he discovers she has a lover, he blackmails her intoplaying a game of identity that ends in disaster.Hope you glom onto a copy!Blue skies,Les"},
{"title": "THE RAPIST COMING OUT IN GERMAN WITH PULPMASTER", "date": "Saturday, June 8, 2013", "text": "Hi folks,Got some cool news to passon.First, Jon Bassoff, mypublisher for THE RAPIST with his New Pulp Press, has just sold the Germanlanguage rights for it to Pulpmaster! He tells me it looks favorable that they may also buy the German edition of THE BITCH when he (re)publishes that novelin August.This is my first-everforeign rights sale for any of my books and I’m on that proverbial Cloud 9!What’s really cool about this is that my late friend Cort McMeel and I oftentalked about the German intellectual atmosphere (and Europe in general) and how Germany was the first to publish Charles Bukowski when he couldn’t get publishedin the U.S. And, how John Martin was the first U.S. publisher to get Bukowskiinto print here with the press he founded just to publish him—Black SparrowPress.. We talked often about how we felt Jon Bassoff was our nomination forthe John Martin of contemporary publishing, with the books he was publishing.Years ago, my advisor, Dr.Francois Camoin, at Vermont College when I was pursuing my MFA, was the firstto read THE RAPIST, and he told me at the time that he thought I would find itdifficult to get it published in this country and that he thought it fit the Europeansensibility and sophistication in letters and philosophy much better. Headvised me to seek out a publisher in Europe (his preference was for a Frenchpublisher). The thing is, at that time (1996) there were very few, if any,publishers with the cojones of a Jon Bassoff at the time or it might have beenpublished much sooner.It’s entirely due to Jonand the reputation his press enjoys that having it published byPulpmaster is possible. Thanks, Jon!For those of you who enjoyfiction that goes outside the PC boundaries of “safe” writing, check out thelist at New Pulp Press. The folks he publishes are the reason I submitted tohim. I read every single one of his books and there wasn’t a single one thatwasn’t flat-out brilliant and amazing. Not one!THE RAPIST is also beingconsidered by an Italian press and is currently being read by a top Italiannational reviewer.Also, my agent, ChipMacGregor just informed me that THE RAPIST was a Kindle Daily Deal recently. I’mnot sure what that means, but Chip tells me it’s a good thing.Other news…One of my long-time writingclients, Hollywood attorney Bob Rotstein, has just had the legal thriller I hadthe pleasure of working with him on—CORRUPT PRACTICES-- published this month bySeventh Street Books, an imprint of Prometheus Books. It’s garnering terrificreviews and has been blurbed by such well-known writers as Sue Grafton and LesStaniford (who encouraged Bob to write a book in the first place.) I had thepleasure of coaching him during the writing of it for the past couple of years.He just called me to ask me to take a look at his next book and I can’t wait!This is a fantastic book. If you like legal thrillers and psychological novels, this one's for you! And…A classmate of mine atVermont College just published his first novel and it's coming out with a bigsplash. Check out Charlie Lovett’s THE BOOKMAN’S TALE from Viking/Penguin. Wehad a small class of about a dozen and every single one of us has made somenoise in publishing. Charlie’s book looks like it’s going to make some veryserious noise! Check it out. It’s been an exciting week!And yet, after everything that’s happened, I just looked into the mirror… and I’MSTILL UGLY!Life isn’t totally fair…Blue skies,Les"},
{"title": "THE REAL LOWDOWN ON WRITING CONFERENCES", "date": "Monday, June 3, 2013", "text": "WRITING CONFERENCES            Many billions of yearsago, when mankind (men, who were kindhearted and a couple of women) first beganto write, there were very few places to learn the craft. This was during theperiods we know today as the PalaeolithicAge, the Mesolithic Age, the Neolithic Age, the first Roosevelt administration,Obama’s last term, and the Age of Aquarius.            There were only a couple of women writersbecause they had to go to work to support their writer-husbands. There wasvirtually no money in those days for cave-drawing-writers. Certainly no medicalplans!            Mostly, there didn’texist places to learn how to write… primarily because we didn’t have words in those days. (Or four-star hotels to host conventions) Writingwas a form where we used pictures, carved on cave walls. We had words, but justa few. Maybe a dozen. Words like “ugh” and “booty” and “dinosaur” (Englishtranslation—the original word in cave-man language was “big ol’ dog.”) and “self-aggrandizement.”And these few words only existed in oral form. There was no actual “writing” aswe know it today, because we didn’t even know such things that we considerbasic today, like dangling participles and adverbs. We didn’t even havedictionaries! We were poor, Jack!            Things were tough thenfor writers. Not only didn’t we have dictionaries, we had to walk to school tenmiles each way… through six-foot snow drifts!            No, wait. That wassomething else. That was my childhood.            The point is, we’vecome a long way, baby!            Today, we have wordsand a modern phenomenon we call “sentences.” We have dictionaries and eventhesauruses (or is that thesauri?). We have COMPUTERS! We have all these thingsand we even have schools and other avenues to learn our craft. By schools, Imean MFA schools. Where, when I went, you had to walk ten miles each way…through six-foot high snowdrifts!            Some things neverchange.            Today, as we all know,there are secrets to becoming a bestselling author. And, it’s becomeridiculously easy to acquire these secrets, when, once learned, one can quitthat bullshit day job at MULTIPLEX CORP and just travel around to bookstores and sign mounds andmounds of our novels and eat at Elaine’s where we can wave across the room toWoody Allen who is a GENIUS. (Like us.)            We have craft booksand better: we have BLOGS which are electronic places we can access easily andlearn from incredibly good-looking, incredibly smart, amazingly well-hung writers such as MYSELF,all of those secrets.            We also have eventsthese days called WRITER’S CONFERENCES. These are the best places to learnthose secrets that lead to bestsellerdom. Why? Well, because the bestsellingauthors themselves ARE THERE IN PERSON and guess what? They are ALL DRUNK andHANGING OUT IN THE BAR. Where, all you have to do is buy them a Jack and waterand they will share these vital secrets with you! They are all more than happyto do so. They are happy to do anything ifyou only buy them a JACK AND WATER, including random sex acts usually only seen in Juarez, Mexico! Unless, ofcourse, you want to glom onto the secrets of a romance writer. Then, you needto buy them a drink which has an umbrella in it. But, if your ambition is towrite gritty, crime and noir novels, then you need to stick to those manly guysdrinking JACK AND WATER. And, romance writers aren’t in the bar anyway. They’reall up in their hotel rooms with other romance writers DOING RESEARCH in theirvibrating hotel beds. (Nobody knows where the sci-fi writers are. Best guessessuggest either men’s bathrooms or hanging with the hotel janitor.)            What do you supposeOg, back there in his cave, chiseling out his romance novel of his tryst withMoggy on the cave wall would have given to be able to attend a writer’sconference? A LOT, that’s how much! If only for the vibrating hotel beds. Also,to get away from his wife Zelda, who has just found out about Moggy…            And the umbrelladrinks.            For those of you whohave yet to attend a writing conference and are frothing at the mouth to get toone, I’m going to let you in on how they work so that you can maximize yourtime while there and get a whole bunch of writing secrets that will… youguessed it… catapualt you into the ranks of BESTSELLERDOM! This is all insidestuff, so pay attention. Plus, it’s guaranteed to get you on the list and beinterviewed by Grit Magazine and the NY Times! Your reviews will consist oforiginal, truly descriptive words like “riveting” and “page-turner” and“brilliant” and “short.” (Well, the last only if you’re Tom Cruise and havejust penned an autobiography.)            First of all, youshould probably attend one of the panels. One is plenty. They’re all prettymuch the same and while the organizers seem to put a lot of emphasis on theirwebsites and in their glossy brochures on the panels they’re offering fromBRAND-NAME AUTHORS (a clever synonym for BESTSELLING AUTHORS), like they sayabout Paree: “When you’ve been with one hooker, you’ve been with them all.” No,wait! That’s something else. I meant to say: “When you’ve been to Paree it’shard to go back to the farm and concentrate on the corn crop.” NO! That’s not it,either! Dang it. I forget what the saying is, but the gist of this is that onepanel is all you need to attend. Trust me on this.            What will the panel beabout? It will be some guys and gals sitting at a table in front (get thereearly and grab a seat up front as there will always be at least one guy who isconsidered a SERIOUS WRITER who talks really softly and forgets he or she has amicrophone so you’ll want to be close enough to hear him/her when they begin toimpart their secrets. It will be the best secret of all, but the bad news isthat you’ll only be able to make out about every third word as the rest will bedrowned out by thunderous applause whenever his mouth opens or he tugs at apesky nose hair.            No matter what thetopic has been labeled, it will always end up being about ADVERBS and whyREALLY SMART WRITERS never use them. Well, hardly ever… Scarcely ever, anyway.Occasionally, at best.            This will be the onlything you’ll learn from the panel.            Even if the publicizedtitle of the panel is:DISTINGUISHED PULITZER PRIZE WINNERS TALKABOUT HOW CREEPING EXISTENTIALISM AND THE NATIONAL GROSS PRODUCT FIGURES OF1997 ARE IMPACTING THE LITERARY TABLEAU AS EVIDENCED BY THE SCHOLARLY JOTTINGSOF “FIFTY SHADES OF CRAP” AND OTHER POST-MODERN CLASSICS… WITH LOTS OF QUOTESFROM HAROLD BLOOM(Hint: If you don’t know who Harold Bloom is, you’re in the wrong room.This is why you’re the only one here, Boobie.)            …even if thepublicized title is the above, that part will only take about 43 seconds andthe rest of the panel will be devoted to… you guessed it! ADVERBS. Also, somestuff on what we laughingly call “Writers’ Bumper Stickers of Wisdom.” You’veprobably seen some of these around town on Government Motors (GM) trucks drivenby short, redneck guys who look a lot like TOM CRUISE but with fewer teeth. Thesestickers will be composed of pithy, but true, nuggets of writerly wisdom like:“Show, Don’t Tell.” This means (in literary language) if you find yourselfpregnant by a BRAND NAME AUTHOR, don’t tell on him, or you can kiss goodbye hishighly-desired blurb on your tome that is guaranteed to sell a bazillion copiesof your opus to people who only buy because Frephen Fing (Not his real name—I’mprotecting his true identity, out of respect.) or Frichal Fordan has said itwas a “riveting, page-turning, brilliant read… and it’s short.” You’ll be showing,soon enough. No need to tell.            It’s always a soundidea to visit the bar before attending the panel and, if the organizers of theevent were smart enough to hold it in a civilized city like NEW ORLEANS wherethey have GO-CUPS, take one with you to the panel. If, unluckily it’s in aplace like CLEVELAND, go early to the bar and drink two more than you normallywould. Ideally, you’ll drink enough that you’ll pass out for the entire lengthof the panel, but even if not, you’ll be able to get through it by realizing:YOU’RE IN FREAKIN’ CLEVELAND!            How the hell did thathappen? Wallowing in the misery that comes with knowing you’re spendingperfectly good money to spend a rainy, sleety, windy, COLD-ASS weekend in the MISTAKE BYTHE LAKE (clever and revealing Chamber of Commerce proclamation that’s plastered all over theirbrochures), the panel won’t suck as much as might have in a really cool placesuch as… NEW ORLEANS! Where you probably won’t bother with panels at all but dothe smart thing and just hang out in the hotel bar the entire time. Or any bar.             Okay. You got throughthe panel and can breathe a sigh of relief that that’s over and you can tell your wife when you return home thatyou learned “a ton of stuff at this panel I went to. They covered adverbs pretty thoroughly and the REALLY SERIOUS WRITER GUY said something really profound. As soon as I can find my notes I'll tell you what he said.” It also means you can write it off on your taxes.            You might be askingyourself why do obscenely-rich, incredibly handsome, extremely well-hung BRANDNAME AUTHORS (such as myself) deign to even sit on these panels and yak aboutADVERBS.            Good question! Itshows… you aren’t drunk enough yet if you’re thinking this logically. Go ahead. Grab yourself a JACK AND WATER. I'll wait. It'll help you get through the rest of this. Make it a double--you'll thank me later.            The answer is thatalthough we’re all OBSCENELY-RICH BEYOND ANYONE’S WILDEST DREAMS, it isn’tthrough the royalties on our BESTSELLING BOOKS. The truth is, we don’t makesquat on those. Are you kidding? It all looks great to the outsider, but thetruth is, as they say about almost everything, stranger than fiction. Here’s the truth about royalties.            Let’s say the booksold a million copies. That’s a lot, right? Well, the joke’s on you if youthink the author himself made very much.            First of all, thereare other hands in this pie. (If you think these metaphors and similes orwhatever they are crap, don’t forget I’m a BESTSELLING AUTHOR and can do thisall day long and you can’t do a thing about it so just shut up and lie down byyour dish.)            To begin with, thepublisher keeps 85% of all the money. Yep. Thas’ right. I didn’t stutter. The writergets to keep 15%. Only he doesn’t.            His agent takes 15%off the top. This is to pay him or her back for taking your phone call when youinform him you just sold your book to an editor you just met at the BAR INCLEVELAND. He’ll also do some other valuable work on your behalf when he looksover the contract which basically sells you into servitude for the rest of yournatural life, plus ten years and says, “Yep. Looks good. Sign on that line onthe last page where your full name is printed out above.”            Money well spent!            Then, the publicisttakes 20%. What, you say? The publicist? Whatif I don’t want no friggin’ publicist? Well, go ahead and don’t have one, buthow do you suppose your book sold a million copies without one? The answer is,there are only 16 people in the world who have Oprah’s private phone number andcan get you booked onto her show which is the only way you CAN SELL A MILLIONFRICKIN’ COPIES OF YOUR STUPID BOOK, btw. And, of those 16 people, 15 ½ arepublicists. (The other one is TOM CRUISE, which is why he gets a half.) So, youneed a publicist. Wake up and smell the pillow, moron! (Smells like drool,doesn’t it?) The other half goes to CHER who hasn't written a book (has she?) but definitely has  a PUBLICIST and her publicist has Oprah on speed dial in case she has another kid like the one in that movie. Go CHER!            Then, your agent haspresented you with a great idea. To get the bestseller deal going, he suggestsyou take a portion of your royalties (say, 65%) and sneak into variousbookstores in various disguises… and buy up copies of your own book!            It’s a brilliant ideaand you glom onto it instantly! Why? Well, the guy giving you this advice isobviously a GENIUS—after all, he just scammed 15% of your money just byanswering the phone, so he’s already shown you he’s no dummy.            All over yourgeographical area, stores are calling into Barnes & Noble regional centers(Barnes & Noble because they’re the only bookstore left) to report thatsales of your opus are “flying off the shelves!” (Bookstore owners use clicheslike this all the time because they mostly read bestsellers and that’s whereall the clichés are.) Barnes & Noble speaks regularly to the NY Times andOprah (they meet at Elaine’s at the table just behind WOODY ALLEN’S), and whenpresented with the news that your opus is flying off the shelves (this is justa highly original way of saying they’re selling a lot and the cashiers arecalling in sick with an outbreak of carpal tunnel syndrome from punching cashregister keys), they say to themselves, “Hey! This is a bestseller! Let’s getit on the list! Let’s book this guy on the show.” (The NY Times says thebestseller thing and Oprah says the show thing. After which, the waiter bringsthem all a round of mimosas and they toast each other for their acumen. TheB&N person is the last one to leave and she gets the bill. Which is addedto your expenses…) Meanwhile, you'll have to start parking your car and snow-blower in the driveway as your garage will be full of books...            There are other folkswho get a piece of your pie. The publisher will want a photograph of you forthe back cover, which you’ll pay for. Your wife’s Kodak moment taken atDisneyland when you rode the Small Cups Ride won’t work. They’ll laughhysterically when you try to foist that one off on them. No, they’ll have tosend out a New York photographer, because everyone knows New York photographersare the only people who know which end to look through and where the little buttonis to click on a camera.            Except, it’s not thatsimple. (You saw this coming, didn’t you…) It never is. It turns out that theNew York photographer is TOO GOOD! Your photograph looks… EXACTLY LIKE YOU!That will never do. This is against tradition. The author’s photograph shouldbe of him (or her, if the author is a woman), but it has to be of him or herfrom thirty years ago and nearly unrecognizable. That’s why when you went tothe panel, you couldn’t recognize any of the BRAND NAME PANELISTS. None of themlook like their photos. This is why. The photos were all taken at a time whenthey were younger and dumber and full of… (sorry, I forgot this was a familyvenue).            Who wants to see anold geezer on a book jacket? NO ONE. That’s why they’re always photos takenjust when the author was mustering out of the service just after WWII, stillwearing his bomber jacket and looking jaunty (writer’s word that means… I don’tknow what it means. It means jaunty.Some kind of peppy look, I think. With a crinkly smile.)            This means that thepublisher will then request one of your wife’s Kodak moments, taken just beforeyou were married that June day in 1954 and still had most of your teeth. They’llwant the one taken just before youwere married, where you still knew how to smile. WITH ALL OF YOUR TEETH--THE FRONT ONES, ANYWAY. Those so-called \"smile teeth.\" Unless you're a crime or noir writer. Then, you should never smile in public and never for a photograph! Are you nuts?            You’ll learn thatanother massive charge has been marked against your account. They had toPhotoshop the picture (they’ll charge you for the price of the Photoshopprogram, btw. You didn’t think those paid for themselves, did you!). You’llalso note in the itemized charges a fee for the guy who manipulated thePhotoshop program to make it look “current.” Which means making the Tiny CupsRide disappear and changing the sepia tones to color. This is done by a guy inthe basement (who writes sci-fi novels when he isn't working the Photoshop machine).            You’ll be amazed atthe skill this guy has brought to the table! Instead of that old snapshot youremembered, where you threw up seconds after it was shot and where to yourtrained eye you can already detect the glassiness in your stare—now you’relooking at a photo of your old, long-gone self… STARING OUT TO SEA WITH A SOULFUL, DEEP EXPRESSION, DIGGING YOUR TOESINTO THE SAND. Suitable for a People Magazine cover of… TOM CRUISE. In fact, itlooks like almost all photos of TOM CRUISE IN PEOPLE MAGAZINE, except the guyin the picture (you) isn’t short. That’s because it’s shot from ground level,the so-called “power shot.”            Anyway, I won’t boreyou (further) with how your royalties all disappear, but will make a long storyshort (I know, I know… it’s too late!), by saying the reason BESTSELLINGAUTHORS and BRAND NAMES do these conventions and sit on panels discussingADVERBS and why you shouldn’t use them even if they do and are BESTSELLING AUTHORS in spite of the terrible obstacle which adverbs pose, is because it’s theonly way they can make any money. And, the whole reason they’re there (besidesthe fabulous sums the organizers throw at them), is because there’s always ABAR on the premises.            Which is where they’llbe when they’re not on their panels.            This is the end of ourdiscussion today on WRITER’S CONVENTIONS. Why? Because all this talk about barshas made me thirsty and I crave me a JACK AND WATER.            We’ll pick this upagain (when I feel like it), and talk some about writer’s conventions GROUPIESand how to successfully stalk a BRAND NAME AUTHOR.Until then… happy writing!            Before I leave you,let me leave you with one valuable piece of advice. If you find yourself at awriter’s convention, and you spot BRAND NAME LEE CHILD, under no circumstanceshould you approach him and say the name, \"TOM CRUISE.\" Mr. Child is a big guy (contrary to what his name would lead you to believe) andtrained in some of the more popular martial arts. Just sayin’…Blue skies,LesThis message was brought to you by the publisher of THE RAPIST. Pleasebuy a bunch of copies so that Les can join the ranks of the BRAND NAME AUTHORS!Remember: Christmas is just around the corner and what better gift could Grannyever wake up to than a copy of THE RAPIST in her stocking? (The one on the mantelpiece,not the one she’s wearing…)"},
{"title": "HARD TRUTHS: Interviews of crime writers by Tony Black", "date": "Saturday, June 1, 2013", "text": "Hi folks, Disclaimer: Please be advised there is some strong language and adult situations in the material below. One of the top crime writers in the world, Tony Black, has just published a book of interviews, HARD TRUTHS, with other crime/noir writers... and I'm in it! It's a very humbling honor to be included with the august list of writers Tony has assembled here. This ranks as one of the two best interview experiences I've ever had, along with the one Richard Godwin did for his \"Chin Wags at the Slaughterhouse\" which is due to appear in the next print version of Grift Magazine.U.S. readers just click on the cover to go to the Amazon site. UK and European readers can go HERE.From the promo copy:Hard Truths is an 85,000-word collection of interviews withthe crime genre's most accomplished writers. As both an award-winning journalist and one of the most acclaimed crime writersof recent times Tony Black is uniquely placed to cross-examine crime fiction'sbestselling authors. Names like Ian Rankin, Irvine Welsh, Andrew Vachss, LesEdgerton and William McIlvanney reveal the secrets of their craft in a seriesof interviews conducted over the last five years.Black takes an often no-holds-barred approach and pushes friendships to thelimit as he teases out the truth on subjects as diverse as politics, thewriting life, popular culture and personal histories. Always entertaining andoften heartfelt these exchanges offer an entertaining, humorous and eclecticlook at some of the genre's leading lights.\"For anyone at all interested in crime writers and crime writing - hell,for anyone even vaguely interested in writing and stories - this is anindispensable collection, full of insight and revelation.\" - from the forewordby Doug Johnstone, author of Gone AgainThe Interviewees:Ian RankinStuart MacBrideKen BruenIrvine WelshCaro RamsayAndrew VachssStephen LeatherCathi UnsworthR.J. EllorySimon KernickWilliam McIlvanneyAllan GuthrieLes EdgertonPaul SayerMartyn WaitesHoward LinskeyShona MacLeanNick StoneIan HamiltonBob MayerDeclan BurkeRay BanksRussel McLeanBarry GrahamCraig McDonaldNick BarlayCharles ArdaiExcerpt from our interview:LES EDGERTON has done a lot of living. Ifthere's a book in most people, there's a library in Les. In his time — Les is now 70 — he seems tohave done it all. By it all I mean he's travelled the gamut from east towest, north to south, lost to found . . .You can count the bends in the road. Astring of wives. Drug dealing. Life on the street. A burglary rap. Theinevitable time inside.As he recounts the trials and tribulationsof a life that might make Neal Cassady's head spin it's as if it all happenedto one of his characters. Les remains resolutely Les throughout: an erudite,witty, well-read road warrior with an eye for the absurdities of life.Whilst other writers might rage against thepublishing machine, he's wise enough to see the ignoble hands on the levers. He'shad his successes — he is undoubtedly a quite outstandingly talented writer andperhaps deserving of more plaudits — but he gives the impression that justhaving a hand in the publishing game is worthy of mocking derision.Les is all about the writing, the integrity. . . and that's a commodity worth bottling in these days of near drought.Tony Black: I'vedone quite a few of these interviews now, Les, and I have to say this is thefirst where I don't know where to start —to say you've led a colourful life is a bit of an understatement . . . Let'sstart at the start, then. You've said 'dysfunctional families germinate writers'—discuss . . .Les Edgerton: I thinkif you talk to just about any writer worthy of the name, you'll find they camefrom a dysfunctional family. It's a background that just germinates writers.Think about it — if you grew up in a happy family, you wouldn't have anythingto write about and you'd probably end up selling insurance. Fiction is aboutone thing only — trouble — andif you've never had much trouble in your life, you won't have anything to writeabout or probably even understand what trouble is.I was at a writer'sthing one time where Mary Karr (The Liar's Club) was appearing and shemade the statement that all writers come from a dysfunctional background. Allof us writer-types standing around nodded sagely at this precept and thensomeone asked if she could define a dysfunctional family. Karr laughed andsaid, 'That's easy. A dysfunctional family is any family with more than onemember.'Tolstoy said it thebest in Anna Karenina with the line: 'Happyfamilies are all alike; every unhappy family is unhappy in its own way.'My own family was fucked up in just aboutevery way they could have been. My mother was a religious fanatic — 'fanatic'isn't a strong enough word for what she was and is — and my father wasbasically a brute who abused me in just about every way you can imagine. Myfather didn't spank me. He whipped me with various objects, including a live kingsnake,and usually would taunt me to fist fight him and when I got bigger would do thesame saying that if I ever whipped him, he'd just go get a two-by-four and takecare of me like that. Nice guy . . . My mother did her part in the abusedepartment, mostly emotionally and mentally.Two years ago, at the age of sixty-eight, Idiscovered the man I had been told was my father all my life wasn't. Tocompound the injury, my mother named me after him — I'm a frickin' junior! — andto this day won't tell me who my real father is. However, she claims God hasforgiven her. I guess lying to your son for all of his life doesn't requireforgiveness in her mind . . .There's plenty ofmaterial in Les Edgerton's experience; can we take a few highlights — or lowlights — and talk about them? Let's start with yourtime working as a gigolo 'servicing older women' . . .I don't know if I'dterm it as being a 'gigolo'. Well, maybe it was. What happened was one of thosestrokes of luck. I had one of my girlfriends, Cat, stab another girlfriend,Rachele, and almost kill her and try to nail me as well. I got the knife awayfrom her and took Rachele to the emergency room. When I was waiting there,Rachele's mom showed up with this guy and told me that if Rachele died, I wouldtoo and the guy with her would be the one to render me room temperature. Turnsout, she was connected and that's exactly what this guy would have done. Well,it's what he would have tried to do — I wasn't exactly helpless. Anyway,Rachele pulled through and we began to date heavier, which was tricky as shecouldn't move much or she'd pull her stitches out. Anyway, she and her motherboth worked for a guy who was kind of a criminal kingpin. He had a cottageindustry where he hired older women like Rachele's mom to make these fishinglures in their home a la piece work, and to grease the deals with the nationalbuyers of stores like K-Mart, he gave the buyers lots of coke and weed. He alsohad a regular drug business and used people like Rachele when they were underthe age of 18 to transport his drugs from Houston to New Orleans. If they gotbusted, since they were underage they'd just get probation and he'd never usethem again. Rachele was over 18 but had never been caught, so she was stillworking for him.Well, after she got outof the hospital, I started going with her to Houston and that was anexperience. We'd go to this Quonset hut warehouse with tons and tons of weedpiled high and all of these illegal aliens moving pallets of weed around withforklifts. Quite a sight. Anyway, the guy who Rachele and her mother worked forand me got to be friends and he had another sideline business — an escortservice where young studly dudes like myself went out with older, wealthywomen. I'd made several stag movies years ago when I was 18 and living inBermuda and he found out about that and asked me to work for the escortbusiness.It forces you to learnto be creative in the sack . . . My favourite client was the heir to the famousPontchartrain Hotel — she was in her eighties and actually still fairlygood-looking. She took me to Puerta Vallarta with her and her girlfriend. Sherented the villa that used to belong to Richard Burton and Liz Taylor and itwas a really fun week!That's a book right there, Les . . .I think you're right. And, I have one . . .We talked a bit about my newest book, THE RAPIST, and how I came to write it. For the entire interview and lots of otherinterviews by writers better known than me, glom onto a copy!Blue skies,LesP.S. A bit of news. My agent was recently successful in getting back the rights to my novel, THE BITCH, and it's currently on the desk of a publisher I hope chooses to publish it. I won't go into the reasons we pulled it from the original publisher--not important--but will just say I'm delighted to be able to go forward with a new press. If and when we place it and it becomes available again, I'll announce it here and by yelling out of my window. What's sad, though, is that I had a bunch of really cool reviews posted on it on Amazon and those are gone! When it comes out again, if anyone reading this had posted a review and still has it, I'd really appreciate it if you'd repost it. Thanks!"},

Stateham has just come out with his latest novelin the Turner and Frank series. My buddy, B.R. Stateham. My question to him is: Where do you find someone old enough to remember how to cut a flat-top? I mean, besides me?Here's the skinny on BR's newest:Turner Hahn and Frank Morales Are BackHomicide detectives Turner Hahn and Frank Morales are back on duty in theirnew novel, Guilt of Innocence.The two are investigating a couple of murders which pushes them to thelimits of their wits. One case involves the death of a very successfulcorporate lawyer. A high priced corporate lawyer who happens to be married to awoman who heads the largest cosmetics firm in the country. How the murder tookplace is perplexing enough. But as more bodies begin to drop Turner and Franksoon realize they are facing a maniacal mastermind who may very well be smarterthan both of them combined.Twists and turns, dead ends and red herrings . . . with an ending that willtruly be surprising. This case has it all. And this is only case number one!Case number two involves the disappearance of a young girl fifteen yearsearlier. A Cold Case File. Except it is not a cold case any longer. The girlhas returned. And now lies on a cold metal table in the morgue. Someone hasgone out of their way to make the homicide look like a suicide. Apparently acrime syndicate is frantic to make sure neither Turner nor Frank find out thefacts surrounding the girl's disappearance fifteen years earlier. A hit man isin town grimly eliminating everyone who may have known the girl. A hit man withorders to possibly rub out Turner and Frank as well.And again the real killer is someone whom no one would have ever suspected.Turner and Frank are at their best. Dry wit, interesting characters, lots ofaction, vivid imagery, and two genuine classic mysteries. All of it can befound in Guilt of Innocence. Find it anywhere ebooks are sold.B.R. Stateham is a sixty-four-year old curmudgeon who writes genre fiction.

Especiallywhen I get to see my best friend, Tom Rough, and our star writer and greatfriend, Maegan Beaumont. Maegan was the reason I got to go to Scottsdale. Herfirst novel, CARVED IN DARKNESS,  has just been released and her official booklaunch took place at the famous Poisoned Pen Bookstore.  And, her husband Joeflew me out there to surprise her and the others in our online class who weregoing to be there, and that’s why I had to keep it secret where I was going. Only problem is, it turnsout it’s impossible for Joe to keep a secret from Maegan! She got it out of himfairly quickly, but we were all able to keep it a secret from our onlinewriting class members, many of whom made it to the bookstore for her talk andsigning. Among them were Mary Edelson who came all the way from Virginia andHolly Love who flew in from Denver.Maegan enjoyed a SRO crowd.She shared the podium with two other writers, but she was clearly the star ofthe show. In fact, when their talk was over, and the three writers sat down tosign their books, her line was the entire length of the store. I felt kind ofsorry for the other two writers who had to sit there and watch her sign bookafter book! I’ve been in that situation and it’s not fun! Maegan giving her talk at the Poisoned Pen Bookstore launch of Carved in Darkness Maegan signing books with two other writersMaegan looking... \"goofy\"...Artist's depiction of Maegan's parents having her sign her book for them... KIDDING! They're very, very proud of her.Joe and Maegan. Thank you so much for flying me out to Arizona, Joe!This is from my earlier visit, but I wanted to show a couple more of our class who were also at Maegan's signing but whose photos I didn't get then. Pictured above are Kristen (who was there, Carson (who couldn't make it), me, Susanna (she was there), Maegan and Linda (who were both there.We had a great visit! Afterthe signing, we went to a party hosted by Maegan’s best friend—who I keptcalling “Val” after the best friend of her protagonist in Carved, who, as itturns out, was modeled after her real best friend whose name I forgot… Val iswhat she’ll forever be known to me as. Really cool party. A bunch of Maegan’sfamily came up from New Mexico and I got to meet her mom and dad. Also got tomeet Maegan and Joe’s kids, who were really cool kids. I especially was excitedto meet her daughter Jaime and Jaime was the first person to read my YA MIRROR,MIRROR  and gave it a rave review on Amazon. Jaime Beaumont--you rock!The next day a bunch of ushung out all day. First, we had lunch at the restaurant where the Arizonawriters in our online writing class meet once a month to cuss me out and thenwe went to a resort hotel where Mary and Holly were staying and just hung outby the pool and had… adult beverages. Just kicked back and bonded over… youguessed it… adult beverages…L to R: Holly, Linda, me, Mary and Maegan. Joe took the photo.Stayed with my best bud,Tom Rough and his gorgeous wife Lisa and equally gorgeous daughter Nicola, and had a BALL!I love Tom and his family. They’re coming to Indiana the first of the month forTom’s grandfather’s 99th birthday and I can’t wait to see themagain.Lisa, Nicola and Tom Rough--Tom's my bestest friend. I had two best friends--Tom and Cort McMeel and sadly, Cort's not with us any longer.On my last day in town,Mother’s Day, I went to lunch with Tom and his family and got to meet hisparents and it became clear why Tom is such a cool guy. Both his mom and dadare just fantastic people and I’m so glad I got to meet and to know them.And, then, finally, Iclimbed aboard the red-eye back home and landed back in Ft.

{"title": "BOOK DEVIL REVIEW OF THE RAPIST", "date": "Tuesday, May 14, 2013", "text": "From Book Devil on Tumblr:I doubtthe term “philosophical crime novel” is something writers that write aboutcrime writers sling about much, but the phrase is definitely and defiantlyapropos of Les Edgerton’s THE RAPIST. The book is most assuredly a crime noveland so readers shouldn’t be frightened away by a description that makes itsound dangerously like a tome and frighteningly unlike a book, say, a highlyreadable but mightily singular piece of crime fiction. While THE RAPIST belongson the shelf next to Dostoyevsky and the like, it also sits snugly andcomfortably besides the gritty, bleak likes of Jim Thompson. Take someThompson, a generous cupful, mix it with the brutal, barren cynicism of JerzyKosinski, then run it through a filter of Camus, finishing with a big chunk ofNietzsche’s attitude. Yeah, it’s got “existentialist” written all over it andflirts dangerously with the blurry line betwixt sociopathology and the mind ofthe ubermensch. Again, I’m scaring you. This is a lean crime novel, vastly morereadable than the cumbersome Dostoyevsky. It’s all told directly to you fromthe central and, with fleeting exceptions, the only character, the rapisthimself. The reader gets an unsettling time spent inside the head of a sociopath.It’s a heady experience. While the prose does at times try too hard to beproper and arrogant, THE RAPIST is a cunningly written piece of brain-shockprose. There’s even twist at the end, but it’s unlike any twist you’ve everencountered in a strictly traditional crime novel. That I can promise you.That, and a terrific read.142 pp.www.newpulppress.comThanks!Blue skies,Les"},
{"title": "IDAHO WRITERS AND READERS RENDEZVOUS--Had a great time--wish you were there!", "date": "Tuesday, May 7, 2013", "text": "Hi folks,Well, I’ve been back twodays now from the Idaho Writers and Readers Rendezvous in Boise and am aboutfully recovered… and tomorrow I have to jump on another plane for anotherliterary event which I’m really excited about… and can’t reveal just yet whatit’s about.(In fiction, we call that “raisinga story question” and they’re intended to create tension for the reader andhelp make the novel a page-turner... I’ll talk about it when I return, so staytuned…)I arrived in Boise, alreadytired from running to make connections in Chicago. I have fairly severe COPD,so it’s not just a stroll for me…My host and benefactor (hepaid for me to come to Boise), one of my publishers, Aaron Patterson, picked meup at the airport. It was the first time we’d met in person, and for somereason I had it in mind that Aaron was 6’5”. When this midget at 6”1” showedup, I didn’t recognize him… Expecting a basketball player, I was shocked tomeet a jockey… Well, maybe not quite a jockey, but not 6’5” either…StoneGate Ink publisher, Aaron PattersonBut, height-challenged ashe was, Aaron turned out to be one of the nicest guys I’ve ever met. He’s alsoa superb and hugely-successful publisher and I’ve three of my books with him—JUSTLIKE THAT, THE PERFECT CRIME and MIRROR, MIRROR. (There’s a new one that willbe forthcoming soon.) Aaron has gone far and above what most publishers do. He’sgotten my work out in print, ebook format, and audio. He’s also extremelysuccessful with his books and authors and after hanging out with him for threedays, it’s easy to see why. He genuinely cares about the folks he publishes. Asdoes his chief lieutenant, Kate Copsey. Here’s a photo of the three of us atthe reading I did on Thursday night at Bruce Delaney’s Rediscovered Booksbookstore. Aaron Patterson, me, and Aaron's CEO, Kate Copsey at the Rediscovered Books Bookstore before my reading in Boise.We drove to his gorgeoushouse and I unpacked a bit and then we hit it to downtown Boise to the BoiseCentre where the event was taking place and checked in. Met the director of theRendezvous, Doug Copsey (who just happened to be the uncle of theaforementioned Kate Copsey). Grabbed an adult beverage and something to eat andthen we were off to my reading. I got to meet my cyber-friend, Bri Clark, and some other delightful folks. One was a lady I know just by her first name--Karen--and she was truly delightful.Me and Bri Clark at the Rediscovered Books reading.Afterwards, Kate, Aaron andI went out to grab a bite to eat and… you know… adult beverages…The next day, theRendezvous began in earnest. Doug Copsey set it up right. I’ve been to lots of writingconferences where you don’t have five seconds to yourself, but he created aschedule where all of the presenters had plenty of time to just mingle and meetand greet and attend other presenter’s talks and it was terrific. I presentedmy first talk in the afternoon when I was delighted to see a full room for mytalk on story beginnings. Great crowd, great questions, great responses. Gotsome wonderful, positive feedback from many of the attendees. They put me inthe Snake Room, which many of the girls I dated pre-getting married, wouldagree to have been fantastic type-casting…BTW, the folks in Idaho arejust the nicest, most gracious, smartest people you’ll ever have the pleasureof meeting. Plus, I LOVE their general politics! I could move there and feel athome instantly. They’re fiercely independent and like me, abhor a nanny state.The rugged individualist still exists, boobies, and they’re in Idaho in bunches.These folks just don’t abide b.s. But, they’re polite about it and not in yourface, strident. Kind of refreshing. Kind of REALLY REFRESHING! I’ll tell you abit later about a small incident at bestselling author C.J. Box’s talk the lastnight that will illustrate what I’m talking about here.That morning, I went toAaron’s presentation on Ebooks: The New Landscape of Publishing which wasdirectly in Aaron’s wheelhouse. He’s one of the most successful ebookpublishers out there. I mean… hugely successful. Then, in the afternoon andbefore my presentation, I got to sit in on author John Rember’s talk on WritingViolence. John had attended my reading the night before and we hit it offimmediately. Along with Aaron and a couple of other folks, he became my “newbest friend.” He reminded me so much—both with his personality and his writing—ofanother “new best friend” Jerry Dennis who I’d met at Yellow Springs for theAntioch University conference I was privileged to be a presenter at earlier,and the first thing I did when I returned home was to introduce them via emailto each other. I hope it’s the start of a beautiful friendship for each ofthem. I got to sit in on the end of another of my “new best friends,”screenwriter Lance Thompson for his talk on Adapting Story to the Screen.Wonderful presentation!Gave my talk and thenmingled. I met so many wonderful writers and readers and I won’t be able toremember all of their names, alas. One guy I met and talked to quite a bit wasa truly terrific guy, Clay Morgan, who runs the BSU Story Initiative. We had alot in common. He’s married to a former astronaut and I was stationed at CapeCanaveral at the NASA complex back in the early sixties and we had stories toswap. I also met a wonderful woman, Amanda Turner, who was one of theorganizers and just a delightful person. She joined us at lunch on Saturday.They have a deal where folks can eat dinner with one of the presenters and shewas part of our merry little group. I met another lady and I’m so sorry I didn’twrite her name down, but we hit it off immediately as she’d graduated from St.Mary’s College in South Bend and her husband from Notre Dame and since I’m alifelong Irish fan, we hit it off immediately. Also at our lunch, was writerGabriel Cardoso, who’s writing a really cool book, and writer Rick Just, whobecame another of my “new best friends.” The next day, Rick and I had amanuscript consultation and I was pretty useless to him as the only crit Icould give him was on one line. If I was Rick, I’d demand a refund… That night we went out andI made the mistake of eating some steamed clams. Had a toss-and-turn night of mild foodpoisoning that I won’t soon forget… My wife Mary reminded me that I’d had the samething happen earlier in the year when I was at Bouchercon, and suggested mildlyin her somewhat inimitable (read: sarcastic) way, that maybe I should avoidseafood when on the road or in places where I couldn’t see a beach… Pointtaken, Mary…I screwed up the next daywith the food poisoning episode. I planned on putting a waste basket up by meat the podium when I began the talk on THELMA and LOUISE, telling the audiencewhat had happened the night before, and that I was putting the waste basketthere in the event of… you know… a ralphing incident. But, I forgot to. I’dplanned at the end to tell everybody that I’d just presented a graphic exampleof a story question. That I knew everybody, even while listening to me, hadpart of their attention focused on the wastebasket, wondering when I was goingto toss my cookies (or clams, as the case might be), and that was what storyquestions do—create tension on the page while reading the narrative… but, alas,I simply forgot and I know I missed my chance to create some writer’s lore andmaybe beget an article in the Glorious Writing Times Magazine about how clever a teacher I was. Wish I coulddo that over…Met some other great folks.Joanne Pence, for one. Had a great conversation with her and unfortunately wasn’table to attend her talk.Had a consultation withRick Just and another writer, Sherry Horton, who was ex-Navy like myself. Shehas a terrific idea for a novel and I got to see her first pages. Met CameronMorfit at lunch on Thursday and was stoked. He’s a senior writer for SportsIllustrated and Golf Magazine and had some terrific stories to tell.And then, I got to meetC.J. Box, the headliner. A couple of weeks before the Rendezvous, I decided topick up one of his books so I’d be familiar with his work. Just the politething to do, y’know? Well, today I’m finishing up the tenth of Mr. Box’s novels…He’s that good. Brilliant writer, huge bestseller, and now I know why. He gavethe keynote speech of the event and it was a corker. During his talk, duringthe Q and A, a guy stood up and asked if there were any gunfights in his books.Well, since he’s got anentire series centered around protagonist Game Warden Joe Pickett and his bestbud, super warrior Nate Romanowski who always carries the world’s biggesthandgun… and enjoys using it… this seems to have been a question that couldonly be posed by someone who had never read Box or, if he did, simply wanted toget his political stance on record… The guy asked if Box had any gunfights inhis novels and he wanted to know as he was against guns because they killedfolks. Guns just walk into rooms and shoot people, I guess… I confess I’mcurious what this fella thinks about violent video games that desensitize kidsinto being able to kill, but that’s something for another forum…Me, I probably would haveengaged in a bit of an argument with the guy, but Mr. Box handled it deftly andwithout pissing anyone (even this guy) off. He simply said, “Well, mycharacter, Joe Pickett is a game warden and the books are thrillers with lotsof truly bad guys, so… yeah, there are gunfights.” He added, “You didn’t thinkthey fought each other with beanbags, did you?” The room erupted and thesituation not only was defused, it was never fused.It was just a wonderfulexperience, every single moment! Hope they’ll have me back at some future date.If I neglected to mentionany of the wonderful folks I met, I’m truly sorry and only have my Halfzeimer’sto blame. If I didn’t remember your name, please know that I remember your faceand the talks we had. There was a group of people who continually manned thedesk to answer questions, direct people, etc., and I regret I didn’t get theirnames. They were so danged helpful and nice, too!One last mention for BruceDelaney who owns the Rediscovered Books bookstore along with his wife. Not onlydid they host my reading, but they were at the Rendezvous every hour of theevent, with a table set up with all of our books. I don’t think they got fiveminutes during the whole time to take a break. And they sold some books! Brucetold me he’d had to recorder my Hooked book four times and they still ran out.I know that first-hand. On the second day, I was signing books and this ladycame up for me to sign a copy of Hooked, and she said she’d just “stolen it.”Literally. She said it was the last one and another lady had it in her hand,and set it down to dig in her purse for a pen and something distracted her andshe turned her head and this lady had snatched it up. Now, this is a woman whocould clearly write a thriller from the bad guys’ pov. I’m just sayin’…If any of you ever get thechance to attend the annual Idaho Readers and Writers Rendezvous… GO! You won’tbe sorry.And, you know what? Theentire time I was there I never ate a single Idaho potato! I think I’ll have togo back and see what they’re like. I hear they’re tasty…Blue skies,LesGotta include a photo of my lovely wife, Mary, whom I usually just call \"Eye Candy\" and who always offers me great advice, like \"Don't eat seafood on the road\" albeit too late..."},

{"title": "CHEATING ON SUBMISSIONS SPACE-WISE--DON'T DO IT", "date": "Monday, April 29, 2013", "text": "Hi folks,Earlier today, I posted acomment in a fellow blogger’s post giving her some hints about submittingwriting samples as part of her application to an MFA program. I thought perhapsit might be somewhat helpful to others so am expanding it a bit to includesubmissions to publications and agents. Here’s what I told her and a bit more:Sarah, I often writerecommendations for students and clients and friends of mine applying to MFAprograms and I give them a bit of advice they haven't heard before. In thewriting sample (of which I've read dozens and dozens and see the same thingdone all the time), I see writers trying to use every square inch of the spaceallowed. Many will \"cheat\" and fudge their margins or line spacing orfont size in an attempt to squeeze in even more. But, that's simply a big redflag to those who read these for admission. All of those tricks are instantlyvisible to the reader and tell us one thing--that this applicant is lacking inconfidence in his or her work. This is a writer who seems to think that themore they provide, the more their ability will shine through. Alas, theopposite will happen. They'll simply look unsure of the quality of their work.The folks who read these are reading tons of other samples also and it's adaunting task. What gets an applicant to the top of the pile and consideredvery favorably is the person who submits just a bit less than the maximumrequired. This exudes confidence for one thing. It also elicits a sigh ofrelief that the reader won't have to read as much. The truth is, any good judgeof writing can tell within a paragraph or two if the applicant has talent ornot. If the prose sample asks for say, \"15-20 pages\" I'd urge theapplicant to submit 18 or 19 pages. It will stand out and very positively, asthe vast majority of the other applicants will submit the entire 20 pages anduse all the little tricks mentioned above. And, if it's a good school, therewill be tons of applicants, most of whom will be rejected. One of the reasons(that no one will tell you) is that the person who submits a bit less than themaximum will be viewed much more positively by the reader than the one whocrammed every possible space with prose.Also, a person who fudges with font size, spacing, etc. has violatedprofessional format and that's another big red flag. It instantly identifiesthe writer as… unprofessional.Hope that helps! And, good luck!This is what agents and editors want to do with their letter openers to those who cheat on their submissions formatting...And…The same advice applies towriters sending in stories and material to writing contests, to agents, toeditors and publishers.Ask any agent and he or shewill tell you the same thing. In their submissions policies it will stateclearly that they want “three chapters” or the “first five pages” or \"fifty pages\" or somethingsimilar. Editors will often ask for the same thing. Publications (especiallyprint publications—it doesn’t matter as much for e-publications simply becausetheir space requirements are normally less stringent), will often have similarparameters—for instance, they’ll say they accept stories “up to twenty pages”or some other such amount.And what happens very oftenis the same thing I described to Sarah above. The writer will “fudge” thesubmission by the same techniques. Instead of 12-point type, they’ll make it11.5 type. Instead of 1-inch margins all around, they’ll “cheat” on the marginsa bit. They’ll also cheat on spacing. Instead of sending it double-spaced, they’llmake it 1.5”. Or, if they’re really computer-savvy, they’ll change the spacingto 1.8” or something like that. Sometimes, they’ll even change the font to onethat allows more words on the page. That’s a cheating technique that’sparticularly… what’s the word?... oh, yeah… dumb…All in an effort to getmore words on the page. The logic they’re employing is that the more they canget the professional to read, the better chance their “genius” will showthrough and their story will be taken, their entire mss requested.Well, I hate to burst suchthinkers’ bubbles, but that isn’t what’s going to happen, booby! The veryopposite will happen. Anyone who reads a lot of material—agents/editors—will spotany of these “tricks” and others just by glancing at the first page. They’llsee what the writer is trying to do and instantly a big red flag is planted intheir mind. It simply shows a writer who isn’t sure about his/her work, andfeels (wrongly) that the more the gatekeeper reads, the better chance theirwork has of being accepted.And, sometimes thesubmission is fudged space-wise not because of those reasons but because thestory they want to submit is just a bit longer than the required maximum. Thesearen’t folks trying to game the system, but simply to get their work in underthe required pages. But, the effect they’re going to have on the reader is thesame. A negative impression. To those cheating on the format for that reason, I’dstrongly urge them to simply edit the story until it does fit the spacerequirements. There’s scarcely a story ever published that couldn’t be cut atleast somewhat. And, if it really can’t be cut, I’d urge you to just not submitit to that place. The editor isn’t going to assume you cheated for that reasonbut is just going to assume you fudged it for the same reasons most others do. And, if you cheated this way in a contest, trust that the judges are going to see instantly what you've done and not only won't your submission be considered but you'll be remembered... And, not in the way you want to be remembered. And, the writing community is a relatively small community and people talk and this kind of stuff gets passed around.The agent or editor who isrequesting “three chapters” is just assuming most novels adopt an averagelength of about 10-20 pages per chapter. What most want are roughly 50 pages.Roughly… They can tell within five pages at the most if it’s any good or not—fiveparagraphs, actually. Fifty pages just gives a pretty good idea if thestructure of the novel is sound or not. And, I’d really urge writers to sendthe first three chapters and not thethree you’ve cherry-picked because they’re your best chapters. That really creates a red flag. The agent oreditor knows instantly that the writer is sending these random chapters forthat very reason—that the writer feels they’re the best chapters. What thatmeans is that if this is what he/she considers the best… and it’s not reallyall that great—then the rest probably sucks. And, that leads to… you guessed it…a rejection.In the case of a largesample—three chapters, etc.—what they really want to see are about 50 pages. Ifyour chapters average three pages, then I’d suggest sending a partial of about50 pages and perhaps state in your cover letter that because your chapterlengths are unusually short, you thought they really wanted to see about 50pages. Usually, however, most submission requirements will make that clear bysaying something to the effect that they’d like to see “about three chapters orfifty pages.” A hint here. The fiftieth page will often end in the middle of ariveting scene and the temptation is to furnish the three more pages that willinclude that scene. I’d suggest not doing that, but instead only send say 45-46pages that do end upon the completion of a scene or chapter.The main thing that’scrucial here is to strongly advise you to never “cheat” or “fudge” theformatting to squeeze more prose on the page. Professionals will see instantlywhat you’re doing and the result will be a negative one. If nothing else, they’llresent what you’re doing. In effect, you’re sending a message that you thinkthey’re stupid enough to not see what is obvious to anyone who’s been readingsubmissions and manuscripts for any length of time at all. It’s an insult totheir intelligence and that’s exactly how they’ll perceive it. To yourdetriment…I hate using this saying(because of my name—I’ve heard it a bazillion times…), but in this case: “Lessis more.” It really is.Hope this helps!Blue skies,LesLooking for a novel in which cheating doesn't pay?

{"title": "Paul D. Brazill talks about noir", "date": "Sunday, April 28, 2013", "text": "Hi folks,Just wanted to share an articlethat just appeared in the respected blog, READ WATCH  PLAY written by “TheGodfather of Noir” Paul D. Brazill. Mr. Brazill does me the supreme honor ofsingling out THE RAPIST which, coming from him, means the world to me.READ  WATCH PLAYTalking about reading every monthin 2013A Shotof NoirApril 24, 2013tags: crimeread, rwpchatby readwatchplay  ‘Noir is often considered as a genre, or sub-genre, and isusually associated with crime fiction. Really though, it is more like a styleof fiction, or even a strain of fiction, rather than a sub-genre that doesn’thave to be limited to crime fiction. Noir winds up becoming a type of fictionthat you have to search for and not always find, which is part of what makes agreat noir story so rewarding when it is found.’ BrianLindenmuth – Spinetingler Magazine, Snubnose Press.Paul D. BrazillCrime fiction is easily and readily sliced up into sub-genres, especially thesedays. We have the cozy, the murder- mystery, the detective story, the policeprocedural, the hardboiled. And it’s also categorised by country too –Scandinavian crime, for example, is expected to be very different to theItalian or French variety.In theabove quote, though, Brian Lindenmuth hit the nail on the head when he talkedabout noir being ‘more like a style of fiction’. More elusive, perhaps. Like amurder glimpsed from the steamy window of a passing train.Theorigins of ‘noir’ as a definition of a sharp sliver of crime fiction goes backto the mid-1940s when the French publisher Marcel Duhamel cleverly packagedAmerican pulp fiction – from the likes of Raymond Chandler, James M Cain, JimThompson, Cornell Woolrich – in black covers, as the imprint Série noire. Andsince then it has also been tied like a noose to the cinematic versions ofthose books. Films that painted the world with light and pitch black shadows.Ostensiblycrime fiction – or skirting its razor edge – noir is a taste that’s as blackand bitter as an espresso or a shot of moonshine-whisky. Noir, for me, is allabout mood. And a dark mood at that because, as Otto Penzler once said, ‘noiris about losers’. For writers and fans of noir, we are all in the gutter butsome of us are looking at the abyss between the stars.So wherecan you get a shot of noir? Try Derek Raymond,  Maxim Jakubowski, VickiHendricks’ Miami Purity, Julia Madeleine, Georges Simenon, PatriciaHighsmith, David Goodis, Leonard Cohen, Tom Waits, Albert Camus’ TheOutsider, Harry Crews, Nelson Algren, John and Dan Fante, Dorothy B.Hughes, Chuck Palahniuk, Alan Guthrie’s Slammer, Dostoyevsky’s NotesFrom The Underground, James Ellroy, Graham Greene, Carole Morin, HeathLowrance’s The Bastard Hand, Ken Bruen’s Rilke On Black, PatrickHamilton’s Hangover Square, Tom Wright’s What Dies In Summer,Donna Tartt, Colin Wilson’s Ritual In The Dark, Steve Mosby, RichardGodwin, Megan Abbott, Josh Stallings – who has recently published a ‘noirmemoir’ called All The Wild Children. And perhaps the most noir of all, Les Edgerton’s TheRapist, which wears its dark heart on its blood-stained sleeve like a callto arms to the dispossessed, disenfranchised and desperate.PaulD.

{"title": "I DO POETRY!", "date": "Saturday, April 27, 2013", "text": "Hi folks,As those of you who’vefollowed my blog for awhile, from time to time I like to include lessons fromthe writers in my online class and from private clients as I think the issuesthey face are pretty much the same as all of us face in our writing and providingthem here may help other writers.And, that’s what I’mposting today.A few years ago, I servedfor three years as the writer-in-residence at the University of Toledo. I’vekept in contact with many of my former students and one of my favorite of thosestudents and I have had a series of communications recently that may be ofinterest and our discussions may also help inform other writers who may be havingsimilar problems. I won’t name her except to call her “K”. K was an absolutedelight in my classes. A highly intelligent, dynamic student, she graduated andis currently teaching in an inner city middle school. She and I hope that I’llbe able to appear before her classes next semester, probably via Skype.Recently, K decided shewanted to try her hand at poetry. I’d seen her fiction—it was extremely good.She asked me if I’d read a couple of her poems and see what I thought and if Ithought they were publishable. If maybe I could recommend someone to send themto. I told her I had a friend who edited a wonderful literary magazine and if Ifelt they were good, I’d be happy to recommend them and her to him. So she sentme these two poems. Here’s what she said and here are her poems.Hey Les,Thank you so much for taking the time to look over my poetry. Even if you findthat your friend wouldn't like it, it'd be nice to have some feedback from you.I'm always looking to get better. I have to admit, I have no idea what apublisher is looking for. I chose two poems to attach because I couldn't choosewhich one to include. I have an emotional connection to both of them becausethey're both poems I wrote after experiencing a miscarriage. I didn't know ifit was too personal of a subject to pass along, but sometimes emotionalsubjects evoke the most feeling, and someone might be able to relate. If theysuck, that's totally fine. Please be brutally honest. If nothing else, it was agood release for me in dealing with a tough situation. The first poem I thinkis the better one, but it also lacks structure. I struggle with rhythmsometimes. Thank you so much again, Les. You've been so helpful and it's beengreat to reconnect. P.S. Did I mention that I'm pregnant? lol- I've yet to write a happy poem aboutit, but it'll come :)A Moment OfRecognitionA moment of recognitionAs you slowly stroll byA cursory glance over your shoulder…Do my eyes defy?Inquiry lies upon your browA slight resemblance amongst the mass?A hesitant acceptanceYes… it’s you… alasIntimate strangers, never having metFamiliar obscurity- finally reunitedNo more questioning, wondering, longingAnticipation and joy ignitedYou’ve made it home.Ever so slowly gainingComfort, confidence, acceptance.But you’ve been waiting…Idly watching, scrutinizing the crowdUntil God grant me accessDesperate to utter the words,“It’s you…alas”Finally the time has comeFor our worlds to intertwineA sigh of relief, utter satisfactionNow you’re finally mineThe torturous wait,The brokenness of my soulIt’s finally making senseI’ve been molded for this… a chance to become wholeEternity with you… not just a reverieI will know every inch of youEvery expression, every feelingMy biggest wish has finally come trueYou stare quizzically from afarLove, joy, apprehensionShall you approach me?Your feet make the decisionNo longer a mirageA shadow in the distanceYou speak the words aloud,“It’s you…alas.”It is then that I know…I’ve made it homeYou with your mother And us with our MakerConsuming SadnessSadnessknocks at the gates of the heartFirstbegging for entry, then demanding accessItspersistence is admirable, yet irritatingItslyly slithers in, seeping into the depths of the soulEverycrevice is filled with its thick, black presenceLeavingno spot left unscathedAllof the joy and happiness are strangled to their deathNostruggle is needed; the victor is clearTheindomitable competitor has won againOccasionally,the soul puts up a fightallto the glory of sadness;Atease, a mockery- It’s amused by the spectacleIt'sall to no avail; there was never any hopeI amits puppet, designed to do its biddingJusta prisoner, succumbing to the tortureWhereis the intervening force?Alight amongst the darkness?oris the suffering mine alone to endure?Sadnessis all consuming, its presence is everlastingItstays until I've withered awayNomore resistance...eternal submissionAfter reading them, here’swhat I told her:Hi K,I looked at your poems and see a coupleof things that I think will make it difficult for them to get published, alas.First, I'm not aware of anyone publishing poetry that rhymes any more as in thefirst one. Other than maybe Hallmark Cards. Or in some Internet journals thatpublish anything. But not in legitimate and serious literary journals dedicatedto quality. That's just kind of been over for many years, at least with seriouspoets. The chief reason being that when a poet has to come up with a word thatrhymes, she sacrifices accuracy for the sake of the rhyme. The heart of allgood writing--poetry or fiction--is truth, and if a rhyme is more importantthan the exact, perfect word, you're at a remove from that truth. Make sense?The second thing is far more important. You said they're both about amiscarriage but I couldn't tell that from either poem. It could have been aboutanything sad. This is really crucial. This is what we usually encounter frombeginning poets and writers. It's why we constantly preach, \"Show, don'ttell.\" What you're doing is writing about your emotion when as the reader,we haven't been privy to what created that emotion and that therefore makes it telling us instead of showing us. And, telling never impacts aperson emotionally. Only by living through the event with the character as itunfolds will the reader ever be impacted emotionally. In effect, such poems aresaying to the reader: Trust me. I've hada terrible experience (which I'm not going to share with you) and I'm going totell you how bad it made me feel.Doesn't work. Alas, will never work. You’re mostly describing an emotion youfelt, but you’re leaving out the most important part—showing us the event thatled to the emotion. That’s totally absent and it’s the most important part.Here's what would work. If you wrote a poem about how you and your partner hadwanted desperately to have a child and then, miraculously, you were pregnant.If you told us something about the anxious moments before you got pregnant andthen took us along as the pregnancy progressed--how you bought a bassinet, babyclothes, painted a bedroom for the baby, tried to decide if you wanted to knowthe sex or not, considered names--in short, all the things couples do whenthey're pregnant. And, then, if you showed the actual miscarriage as ithappened. How it came suddenly, how it happened, what went on in the home, inthe hospital, how your partner reacted, how you reacted, the physical traumayou went through... in short, if you let us see the event as it transpired...then, and only then, we'd feel the emotion you wanted to communicate with thepoem. You wouldn't even need to say how sad or desolate you felt. We'd know,just from living through the event with you.And, that's what good poetry or good writing is. It's showing the event as ithappens. If you give us the event, the reader will experience the emotion.This is so common with beginning poets. I remember teaching in high school andthe usual subjects appear in the students' work. Usually some theme on aboyfriend rejecting the writer or the like. Not putting that down at all--it'svery real to the person it happens to and is legitimate. But, the mistake thewriter makes is in writing about how she feelsand that's simply telling. It doesn't impact the reader in the least. Oh, in aclass where people know the person and may even know the circumstances, theremay be at least some vocal display of commiseration, but we write poetry andfiction for strangers, not those in our inner circle. At least that's who we writefor if we send it out to be published. And, strangers don't know the writer northe circumstances nor the event, save for what they read on the page. And, toread mostly an account of how the person feels won't elicit emotion. Never,except in a very general and vague way, such as when we hear of a bad trafficaccident. We all say: \"Oh, my gosh. That's terrible.\" And then weswitch the subject to the sale down at the mall. But we really don't feel muchexcept in a surface, societal way. We certainly don't feel what the readerintended we feel.This is why at a funeral service when thepreacher gets up to laud a person he or she didn’t know, most of the time hewill offer up well-worn platitudes in generalized sympathetic terms… and eyesglaze over. But… when the guy’s best friend gets up and talks about all thecamping trips they made together and how the deceased kept burning the coffeeevery morning just like he did at home… and how he'd give his last dollar this morning for a cup of that godawful coffee Joe used to make, especially if it was him serving it... then people nod and shake their headsin agreement and feel something. Don’tbe the preacher using Sermonette #93 for the occasion—muttering worn-outplatitudes, couched in so-called “poetic” language. That doesn’t work forfuneral services and it doesn’t work for poetry.It's so important to know this when writing. It's what we mean when we say,\"Show, don't tell.\" Anything important in a poem or a story has to bewritten as a scene. Never by telling the reader after the fact how we “feel.”Look at the little YA play Shakespearewrote, titled “Romeo and Juliet.” If he’d simply given us the couple’s“feelings” without allowing us to live through the event of their deaths andall the circumstances and actions leading up to it and afterward, it wouldnever have been performed on the stage and it certainly wouldn’t have lived onas long as it has in the canon. We feel the emotion only because we werewitness to the event. Even as great a writer as the Bard was, if he’d onlygiven us soliloquies expressing their grief, it would have suffered the samefate as any poet’s work that only contains the feelings after the fact—whichwould have been, “Only available in his room.”Hope this makes sense! You have a gift with language and if you grasp this,your poetry will soar.I'll bet good money that when I was laying out the actions in a miscarriageabove, you felt emotion, and perhaps even intense emotion. If so, that'sbecause you would have been reliving the events as they happened to you. That'swhat you need to do in your poem(s). Deliver the event. Not the emotion youfelt after the event. That's not for you to furnish. The reader will furnishthat if you but provide an account of the event.And, provide a dramatic account, not a melodramaticrendering. That simply means lowering the volume. Let the event itselfdictate the emotion elicited. What’s more powerful—the woman whose child hasjust been run over by a bus who runs out, prostrates herself over her deadbody, raises her face to the heavens while shrieking and tearing out her hairby the handful, cursing against an unfeeling God and even (this is a particularyuck for me) showing “a single tear coursing down her cheek,” or, simply havingthe woman slump to the curb and affecting the thousand-yard-stare soldiers who’vebeen in heavy and sustained combat affect? One is melodramatic, loud and brassyand full of clichés while the other is a truly profound reaction to a tragedy.Opt for drama, not melodrama. If told honestly and truly, the event itself willfurnish all you need for the reader’s emotion.Finally, you said you sent these poemsbecause you had an “emotional connection” to them and that “I didn't know if it was too personal of a subject to passalong, but sometimes emotional subjects evoke the most feeling, and someonemight be able to relate.” Well, K, that’s just about the only reason towrite a poem. That’s what poetry is—it’s expressing to the world what happenedand how it affected the writer emotionally.That isn’t entirely true. There areperfectly frivolous poems, poems designed to provide a political or social statement;in short, a poem can be about virtually anything that interests or impacts thewriter in any way. But what all good poetry has in common is that it’s not arecitation of the writer’s feelings couched in some elevated, melodramatic, “poetical”language. It’s about the thing that created those emotions. Trust the reader’sintelligence—that he or she will “get” the same emotion you did afterexperiencing the same thing you did. You don’t need to tell us you’re “sad” orthat you laughed out loud or that you felt pissed off. We’ll get the same feelingyou did if you write the events that led you to that state.Hope this helps!Blue skies,LesK replied:Hi Les,Wow, Thank you so much for such detailedcomments. They definitely help a lot. The first poem is about a woman (me)meeting my child in heaven for the first time. Since I've never seen him/her, Idon't know for whom I'm looking. I see the child and finally realize thatthere's a family resemblance there and it must be my child. I then go throughthe emotions of waiting for this day to come and how it might feel for thechild too... to embrace someone and dive right into a relationship that isunfamiliar. I thought the ending probably gave clarity to the story line bysaying, \"you with your mother and us with our maker (God).\" I guessyou're right though... maybe the ambiguity isn't a good thing and I should makeit more clear earlier. I guess I thought it added suspense. I also appreciate thecomment about rhyme scheme. That sucks because I originally didn't have itrhyming, but I changed it so that it would. I'll change it back. I see howpeople feel confined by rhyming and they don't effectively get their messageacross because they're so worried about finding a word to rhyme. I like your suggestion about the content of the second one. It does leave thereader in the dark about the situation that caused the sadness. I wrote thatone for my students to study personification and other literary elements, sothat one was vague on purpose because I didn't necessarily want to sharesomething so personal with them. I see how it doesn't really work. Again, thank you so much for helping me. It's hard to know how to get betterwhen I don't know what publishers look for.K I replied:Hi K,I'm so glad you took my comments in the spirit intended--with professionalism!You haven’t changed a bit since our days in the classroom, which is why youwere one of the best students.One thing you said—“I didn't necessarily want to share something so personalwith them”--I want to comment on. Any writing--poetry or fiction--that isn'tintensely personal--to be honest--isn't worth sharing, imo. And, it’s notpoetry. Even with kids. Maybe especially with kids. If we don't expose them tothings that are intensely personal, what kinds of models are we providing? Inmy mind, pretty much meaningless things. If we leave out passion, what isreally left? And, not telling passionbut showing where it comes from andhow it was created.There are two things that make any writingwork. Make it clear and make it interesting. When you say you wrote it for yourstudents to study personification and other literary elements, alas, it doesn’tdo either. Personification is when it’s… what’s the word?... oh, yeah… personal. And, if it’s not interesting—and,laundry lists of emotional terms isn’t remotely interesting—then there are noliterary elements. Literary elements are techniques used to communicateemotion. They’re not something in and of themselves. They only exist to informcommunication. If you’re not communicating, then they’re not literary elements.What happens in many classrooms is that whenkids write anything at all, as teachers we’re overjoyed. Even if it isn’t verygood. It’s so difficult to get kids to write or read at all that any effort iswelcomed joyously. So, we end up accepting less than what they’re capable of.We also end up not showing them what poetry is really about. We end up assumingthey can’t understand or appreciate good writing. That they have to take somekind of “first steps” or something. Ease into good writing gradually. That’ssuch a major piece of b.s. but many buy into that mindset, unfortunately.The truth is, the only thing kids do appreciateand understand is good writing. We do them a disservice by thinking they’re “notready for quality writing.” We end up dumbing down things for them. On asubconscious level, people (including kids) always resent that. The vastmajority of people are pretty smart, no matter the age. They know when they’rebeing talked down to. Or “taught down to.” When they write a poem that’s onlyabout the emotion and don’t give the reason for that emotion, they may bask inthe praise on the surface, but kids know what’s phony and what’s not. Most ofthem have a perfectly good and reliable b.s. detector in their backpacks andknow when they’re being shucked, even when the shuck consists of praise. Infact, that’s how most con games are run—by appealing to the mark’s ego. Often,when we’re the ones delivering the praise, we don’t really feel the work isthat good either. We’re just ecstatic that little Janie or rambunctious Markhas actually written something thatwe don’t offer realistic and honest comments for the work, but more for thefact that they actually put pen to paper and got something down. It’s a firststep, we think. Except…it’s a first step on the wrong path.Watch some of the other kids when someonewrites a poem about his or her “feelings” without a word about what createdthose feelings. I’ll bet at least three kids will be rolling their eyes.Another one will be pantomiming gagging. Usually boys. Our response is to chastisethe miscreant, but we might be better served in figuring out that they’re justbeing honest critics, albeit a bit rude. These are folks whose b.s. detectorsare on and in working order.But, have little Janie stand up and read herpoem about how her mother never cooked supper and how she spent an hour everynight hiding the liquor bottle from Mom and I’ll bet any amount of money therewill be a lot less eye-rolling going on. I’ll bet the audience will betransfixed. And many of them relating to their own experiences. And, they’lllearn what real poetry is and I imagine at least some of them will becomeexcited when they see one of their peers can write something that others payattention to and feel something when they hear it. Especially if Janie neveruses a word like “sad” or “desolate” or “sorrow.” Janie won’t have to. Thelistener or reader will feel all of those things from the event itself. Justlike Janie did.Or, in a different kind of school that youteach in—say a school nestled in a wealthy suburb. Where the Janie there stoodup and read her poem about a father who was never there as he had to travel forhis job and how he’d missed her dance recital and her twelfth birthday partybecause of “business.” That Janie doesn’t have to say a word about how bad shefeels about not having an active father. The poem does all that and many of herpeers will relate. There will be a lot less eye-rolling than if she read somefuzzy piece about her “feelings.” Make sense?Poetry, just like fiction, is about trouble.Even the poem you told me you plan to write—the “happy” poem about your presentpregnancy—will be a much better poem if you include the miscarriage that camebefore.K, I'd like to use our email exchanges on my blogpost if you'd consider givingme permission to do so. I wouldn't use your name at all. I think it would helpa lot of other writers. If you don't want me to, no problem. I won't!But...Blue skies,LesHi Les,You're right about sharing emotionalthings with people, especially our writing. I guess I just wasn't ready to doso because it was still so recent. I could tell them next year when I share itwith them. I also wanted to ask your opinion about adding poetic devices (sounddevices, figurative language, etc...) in the poems. When I spoke with myMasters professor, she encouraged me to use more. That's why in that secondpoem I use personification, alliteration, metaphor, hyperbole, and a coupleother things. Is that something you suggest I focus on, or do you think peoplereally look for that?In response to your question, you can definitely use my poem on your blog. It'svery humbling to have it on there for what not to do- haha. I'm just kidding. Asa writer, I would welcome advice and examples like that in whatever medium Icould get my hands on. So, if I can help with that, then I'd love to. You can sharemy email too. Would it be ok to revise the first poem and send it to you again? It probablywouldn't be for awhile, but I want to see if I change it for the better. KHi K,I’d love to see a revision on the poem!Let me comment on a couple of things you said.First, you have good instincts when yousaid you “weren’t ready to do so because it was so recent.” That’s a verylegitimate concern. Most writers need some distance from truly emotional eventsto be able to write coherently about it. Unless, they’re the writer GrahamGreene spoke of with that “piece of ice in their hearts.” Just wait until youhave enough psychic distance and then write it. But, when you write a poem or astory, I’d make sure you had an emotional attachment to it or it may not end upparticularly well.As far as your professor’s suggestions, Iwould take exception to some of the things she advised. For one thing,alliteration is much in disfavor these days. It’s considered somewhat archaicand draws attention to the writer overmuch by making the reader aware thatthere’s a writer at work behind the words, thereby interrupting the fictivedream. Years ago, we used to see newspaper headlines that used all kinds ofalliteration. No mas, as Roberto Duran famously stated. A reporter usingalliteration these days would probably be fired unless he was working for the Stumpy Hollow Gazette. Considered veryamateurish and just too “cutesy.” I would also eschew hyperbole, at least in aserious poem. It’s really a synonym for melodramatic. If you lower the volume,the effect is infinitely more profound than if you raise it. Let the eventsspeak for themselves—don’t “help” it out by hyperbole. As for metaphor, thoseare fine. One thing you didn’t mention was symbols. Good. Good writers don’tpurposely employ such devices, but let any symbols arise organically out of thework itself and don’t strain to include them. The best symbols and the onesthat work are the ones that are original to the poem or story and arisenaturally. The ones that don’t work are the ones that are consciously inserted.These are things deconstructionists look for. The artist doesn’t. The artistsimply writes a good poem or story.Quality poetry and fiction is alwaysabout affecting the reader emotionally, not intellectually.The thing about professors is that theyhave to have some kind of criteria to judge something. Most of them look forsurface things like the aforementioned. It’s what they’ve been trained to doand perhaps all they’re comfortable with. That kind of exposes such a teacheras someone who doesn’t have much faith in their own acumen to judge the qualityof work, but depends on these kinds of things. They’re looking at the work inan intellectual light instead of an emotional one. I suspect such a person asbeing one who hasn’t published much herself, and if so, mostly in obscureplaces. That may be unfair or even incorrect, but I kind of doubt it.The thing is, writing is based on livinglanguages, English in our case. And, living languages change, mutate, as dotastes in literature. While alliteration, for example, was, at one time,considered a very clever technique, today’s readers are too sophisticated tobuy it. It’s like transitions in fiction. It used to be something taughtavidly. Today, transitions have adopted movie structure and aren’t signaled likethey used to be. Just a couple of examples how both the language and theliterary tastes have changed. And continue to change. The problem is, educatorsin higher education are often behind the times. Just the nature of their jobs…They spend a lot of time, energy and money to learn their body of academia andthey’ve invested in it. Makes it difficult for some of them to change sometimes…Hope this helps, K. Thank you so much forletting me use our exchanges.And, send me that rewritten poem! I havea feeling I’m going to want to recommend it to my friend.BTW, I don’t write much poetry, but here’sone I had published in The Blue MoonLiterary and Art Review about a year ago. I wrote it shortly after I gotout of prison.My Father andRobert Frost/Les Edgerton            One day I found a volume of poetry by Robert Frost in theprison library at Pendleton and checked it out.            Back in my cell, I read: Home is the place where, when you want to go there, they have to takeyou in.            When I madeparole, I called my mom to tell her my good news. I found out that my dad hadnever read Robert Frost.            At least not that poem.Hope you’ve enjoyed this, folks, and that you find it helpsinform your own writing.Blue skies,Les"},
{"title": "A warrior has fallen.", "date": "Saturday, April 20, 2013", "text": "Hi folks,A warrior has fallen. CortMcMeel has left us.Cort was my spiritual brother.We talked often and each time left telling the other we were brothers alwaysbefore we hung up and we were.I can’t stop crying. IfCort could only see the instant and immense outpouring of love and respect forhim that has already begun and is turning into an avalanche of sorrow for ourloss of this truly great man… Already, I’ve received dozens and dozens ofemails and phone calls and everyone feels the same sense of immense loss ofthis most amazing man.If Cort saw me now, withtears running down my cheeks, he’d grimace and tell me to “man up, dude.” He’dreach over and slap me and then he’d grin and we’d be fine. Above all else,Cort was a man’s man. The kind you don’t often run into these days. He tooklife by the horns and never gave any quarter. He was a fighter and literally.He was a boxer in the ring and a pugilist against the injustices of life. Atrue and fierce warrior.He lies now on his shield,gone to, I hope, a better place. The light of the word has been visibly dimmed.We have lost one of the greats. Cort’s vision--his burning ambition--was to bethis age’s John Martin. He had a great start on that ambition and if he’dstayed with us, he would have not only become the Martin of this age, but Iknow for a surety that he would have passed even this legendary editor in hisaccomplishments.He was a brilliant writer.His first novel, Short, was a trueoriginal, a literary work of the first magnitude. He was close to finishing hissecond, Cagefighter, and I hope hehad it close enough to being finished that it can be published. He founded oneof the premier magazines in literary history, Murdaland, and he often told me he felt it to be his favorite bodyof work and probably his best legacy. He founded Noir Nation and Bare Knuckles Press and everything he did inliterature was just of the very finest order. A brilliant writer and perhapseven a more brilliant editor. He had the best eye for literary quality ofanyone I’ve ever been privileged to know, and Cort would rather help anotherwriter achieve success than he himself. He was totally selfless and all he everwanted was to help deliver to the world great writing.Perhaps no one will everknow the demons that pursued Cort. I know a few of them, but I’m sure I don’tknow them all. I do think I know one thing Cort would have wanted. For thosewho speak of him to speak with the unvarnished truth. He was as honest a man asI’ve ever known. He was as good of a man as I’ve ever known.One of Cort's demons was that he cared so much. About truth. About literature. About theworld around him. More and more, he felt that he couldn’t win. How do I knowthis? Because we talked and often. We told each other things we told no oneelse except our wives.I talked to a cousin of histoday, George Clark, who was his first cousin but told me he was more like Cort’sbrother. They were closer than brothers. We feel the same about Cort. The moreI talk to people, the more I find the same thing with their relationships withhim. He touched so many lives in such a glorious way. I’m just so thankful Igot to know and love him.I think what defeated him was that he increasingly foundhimself in a a world in which it had become clear to him that he felt he wasn’tgoing to win under his terms. He loved literature more than anything and hedetested with every fiber of his being what political correctness was doing toour freedom of speech and our literary canon. He just wasn’t the kind of guywho could live with compromise when it came to something this important.A week and a half ago, Cortcalled me and he was clearly not himself. Les, he said, I’ve got a huge, hugefavor to ask of you and if you refuse, I totally understand. What was going onwas he felt pretty sure he was going to lose his job as a trader. He was handlingthat and had made up his mind that he was going after a job teaching writing,which he loved. His wife Sharon was fine with that, even though it meant lessincome than what they’d had.The problem was, as Cortexplained, was that he’d already lost three teaching jobs he’d applied tobecause the schools had seen the Amazon link for my book, The Rapist, whichlisted him as writing the foreword. It was the title that caused these assholesto refuse to hire him. None of them had read the book, but the title wasoffensive to them. Their reasoning, he said, was that if any of the studentssaw it, they’d think he was promoting rape. This is the level our “educators”have fallen to. He detested it, but felt powerless against these kinds ofattitudes.He asked if I’d be willingto take his name off the Amazon entry. There was no way he’d even considerremoving the beautiful foreword he’d written, but he said if he could just takehis name off he felt that would remove any future objections and he couldsecure a teaching job. I won’t go into everything he said, but the gist of itwas that he felt awful in even asking me such a thing. We both believefervently in freedom of speech and both of us detested the politicalcorrectness imbecilic mania that’s impacting everything about free speechnegatively, but he said he desperately needed a job. He hated asking me to dothis, but said he’d never even consider removing the foreword itself—just hisname on the Amazon blurb.I didn’t hesitate a second.Absolutely, I told him. The minute we got off the phone, I emailed Jon Bassoff,my publisher and mutual friend and he took Cort’s name down from the Amazonentry immediately.Cort is the reason thisbook even got published. In fact, he’d wanted to publish it when he was withBare Knuckles Press and when he left BKP, he did everything he could to get itpublished elsewhere and was ecstatic when Jon Bassoff wanted it for NPP becauseof the tremendous respect he had for Jon and NPP. He told me he felt like hewas doing the same thing as John Martin had when he got Charles Bukowskipublished in the U.S. with Black Sparrow Press. In fact, in dozens and dozensof our conversations, Cort always compared the two of us to Bukowski andMartin. He was extremely proud of his part in getting this book published. Hejust felt that he was doing a great thing in getting controversial work intothe light of day. I agree and I owe Cort everything. I’m not telling this storyfor any promotional value in the least, but simply to illustrate how the manthought and his creed.I don’t know nor do I haveany way of knowing this, but I feel as if I’m at least partially responsiblefor Cort choosing suicide. I don’t know if his job search was thwarted becauseof his association with my book or not. If it was, then I have some guilt todeal with.But, I think the educatorswho would deny a supremely talented teacher and writer a job for this mostspecious of reasons should carry much greater guilt. Not that they will. Thosekinds of folks never do.A few weeks ago, Cort and Ihad a conversation on the phone about this letter we were both familiar with.It’s from Charles Bukowski to his editor at Black Sparrow, John Martin. I’mreprinting it here in homage to Cort.8-12-86HelloJohn:Thanks forthe good letter. I don't think it hurts, sometimes, to remember where you camefrom. You know the places where I came from. Even the people who try to writeabout that or make films about it, they don't get it right. They call it\"9 to 5.\" It's never 9 to 5, there's no free lunch break at thoseplaces, in fact, at many of them in order to keep your job you don't takelunch. Then there's OVERTIME and the books never seem to get the overtime rightand if you complain about that, there's another sucker to take yourplace.You knowmy old saying, \"Slavery was never abolished, it was only extended toinclude all the colors.\"And whathurts is the steadily diminishing humanity of those fighting to hold jobs theydon't want but fear the alternative worse. People simply empty out. They arebodies with fearful and obedient minds. The color leaves the eye. The voicebecomes ugly. And the body. The hair. The fingernails. The shoes. Everythingdoes.As a youngman I could not believe that people could give their lives over to thoseconditions. As an old man, I still can't believe it. What do they do it for?Sex? TV? An automobile on monthly payments? Or children? Children who are justgoing to do the same things that they did?Early on,when I was quite young and going from job to job I was foolish enough tosometimes speak to my fellow workers: \"Hey, the boss can come in here atany moment and lay all of us off, just like that, don't you realize that?\"They wouldjust look at me. I was posing something that they didn't want to enter theirminds.Now inindustry, there are vast layoffs (steel mills dead, technical changes in otherfactors of the work place). They are layed off by the hundreds of thousands andtheir faces are stunned:\"Iput in 35 years . . . \"\"Itain't right . . . \"\"Idon't know what to do . . . \"They neverpay the slaves enough so they can get free, just enough so they can stay aliveand come back to work. I could see all this. Why couldn't they? I figured thepark bench was just as good or being a barfly was just as good. Why not getthere first before they put me there? Why wait?I justwrote in disgust against it all, it was a relief to get the shit out of mysystem. And now that I'm here, a so-called professional writer, after givingthe first 50 years away, I've found out that there are other disgustsbeyond the system. . .I rememberonce, working as a packer in this lighting fixture company, one of the packerssuddenly said: \"I'll never be free!\"One of thebosses was walking by (his name was Morrie) and he let out this deliciouscackle of a laugh, enjoying the fact that this fellow was trapped for life.So, theluck I finally had in getting out of those places, no matter how long it took, hasgiven me a kind of joy, the jolly joy of the miracle. I now write from an oldmind and an old body, long beyond the time when most men would ever think ofcontinuing such a thing, but since I started so late I owe it to myself tocontinue, and when the words begin to falter and I must be helped up stairwaysand I can no longer tell a bluebird from a paperclip, I still feel that somethingin me is going to remember (no matter how far I'm gone) how I've come throughthe murder and the mess and the moil, to at least a generous way to die.To not tohave entirely wasted one's life seems to be a worthy accomplishment, if onlyfor myself.yr boy,Hank I don’t know, but I have towonder if what Bukowski had to say here was on Cort’s mind somewhat. If so, Ijust wish he’d stuck it out a bit more. I know he often felt the same wayBukowski did about how life beats one down. He’d had more than his share ofbody slams. But, Cort was always a man of action and I think he just took thewrong action at the wrong time and only wish he’d waited a bit. I wish I’d beenthere to perhaps talk him off that ledge. It was that wild Irish temper of his that made him impatient. If something wasn't right, he couldn't wait to fix it. He did the only thing he knew to do and that was to give battle. He was the most courageous man I've ever known and he was also at times the rashest. He'd just say it was the Irish in him. The Irish! God, ya gotta love 'em. You'll also end up weeping for 'em.But, I wasn’t here for him, and it was adecision he faced and made. He must have felt like all hope was gone and thatmakes me weep more than anything. That a good man like Cort truly was would bebereft of all hope is the saddest thing I can imagine.I can’t begin to list allthe things Cort did for me. He championed my work to everyone he possiblycould. He knew I was broke, so he paid for my wife and me to come to St. Louisto take part in Jed Ayres Noir @ The Bar. This fall, he was going to bring meto Denver to take part in the Noir @ The Bar there. He’s done so much for meand my career and more than that we’d become brothers. And, then, when he reallyneeded a brother, I wasn’t there for him. That will haunt me the rest of mylife. Cort wouldn’t see it that way at all and I know that and that makes itbearable.There’s a lesson here,perhaps. To be aware of our brothers and sisters in life. To be sensitive totheir needs and their pain and even if they don’t ask, don’t allow the signs tobecome invisible, but to reach out and let them know we love them and thatwe’re there for them.I’ll miss you, my friend.More than anything. You have been my hero since you came into my life and willalways be my hero. Thank you.Finally, Cort fits Bukowski’s final thought aboveperfectly. To not to have entirely wasted one's lifeseems to be a worthy accomplishment, if only for myself. Cort’swas not a wasted life—it just should have gone on longer. Even cut far, far tooshort, it was a worthy accomplishment. He just did so very much for others. Theshame is, he should have done far more for himself.Rest in peace, my brother.You made a difference in my life and in the lives of many others. You will notbe forgotten. Everyone of of who are writers has lost a compadre and we all are less than what we were because of it.Blue skies,LesWhat should help Cort’sfamily is if people buy his novel Short.They’ll be able to receive the royalties so give it some consideration, please. For those of you who may not have known Cort, look above at the photo I have on my blog here. Cort is the guy just behind me with the tough guy hat. He was truly a tough guy. One of the fiercest men I've ever  known. He fought for justice and what's right and what is good. I miss him and always will. He was a majestic, heroic man, bigger than life.Hi folks,I just received word that one of my two best friends in the world has taken his own life. I won't post anything about this wonderful man and my \"brother\" until I find out all the facts, but the world has lost a great, great writer, my mentor and my champion in all things literary. He was one of the world's best literary minds that has ever existed.I'm devastated to my core. All I can feel at this time is profound grief. As soon as I find out the entire situation, I'll post more. It may be that his family will need some financial help and if so I may make an appeal to his fellow writers and the readers who loved this man and his work.At this time, I won't tell his name until I know that it's all right to do so.

{"title": "SHORT STORY REVIEW BY BRIAN PANOWICH", "date": "Wednesday, April 17, 2013", "text": "Hi folksBrian Panowich just gave one of my short stories a really nice shout-out and review over at Chris Rhatigan's blog \"DEATH BY KILLING\" that I'm proud to share with y'all. Death by KillingReviews of Short FictionWednesday, April 17, 2013Five You Can't Miss: Brian PanowichConsidering I’m such a noob to the online crime fiction community, I still find myself lurking around the dark corners of the Internet trying to find the best stories out there. This column (Five You Can't Miss) has been invaluable for turning me on to some of the best writing I’ve ever seen, so I invited myself over to maybe return the favor.1. Hatpin By Jen Conley Ms. Conley has consistently turned out some of the best fiction on the planet, and this one over at Shotgun Honey is where my love affair with her stuff began. It’s full of hard as nails female characterization and a lesson in making every word count. Mary Mulligan is my dream girl. http://www.shotgunhoney.net/2012/05/hatpin-by-jen-conley.html 2. Seeds By Chris Leek Chris can throw dialogue into any situation, or timeframe, like it’s nobody’s business. From the world of a hardened black jack dealer in Pigeon, over at Grift Magazine, to trailer trash jargon like A Redheaded Woman, at The Flash Fiction Offensive, but nothing compares to the old western revenge tale Seeds, at The Big Adios. You would think Mr. Leek grew up on a mountain learning how to talk by listening to his uncles and cousins while they brewed up another batch ‘o shine. As good or better than any script Sergio Leone worked from. http://www.thebigadios.com/2013/02/seeds-by-chris-leek.html 3. Pit Stop By Les Edgerton I bought the first issue of Noir Nation Magazine on a whim, not knowing who Les Edgerton was. It included his story Pit Stop and I read it in a fever. It was full of matter-of-fact straight talk that bowled me over. Not once did it feel like “writing”. That shit is what I had been looking for. Lucky for me (and you) the story was an excerpt from the BEST BOOK I’ve read in years called JUST LIKE THAT. Buy it. Read it. Break something. You’re welcome.http://www.amazon.com/Noir-Nation-International-Journal-ebook/dp/B005JTMIPW/ref=la_B000APH7SI_1_15?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1361726865&sr=1-15 4. Folded Blue By John RectorI know this story was written in 2011, but it’s new to me, so I’m breaking the rules a bit. Sometimes a story taps into something so raw and primal that the reader has no choice but to carry it around with them forever. There’s no un-ringing the bell. It’s yours now, whether you want it or not. That’s Folded Blue by John Rector over at Shotgun Honey. It’s the literary equivalent to a layer of greasy film you can’t scrub off. It’s brilliant.http://www.shotgunhoney.net/2011/05/folded-blue-by-john-rector.html 5. Push, Push, Push By Ryan SaylesI’m going to catch a little grief for including Ryan on this list, considering he’s a good friend of mine, and we’ve written a few books together (SEE HERE), but you know what? Fuck ‘em. The guy can write. I’m going to bend the rules a little further by recommending a story no one has read yet except the editors who keep rejecting it. (Yes, it’s that good.) In 2011, Sayles and I both submitted some stories to an anthology that was kicking off, and we both got rejected. I asked him to send it to me, and I can see why it keeps getting turned down.Because it’s fucking brilliant. Sometimes the world needs time to catch up to genius, or maybe they’re just scared. The story is one huge chunk of dread that sits on your chest and squeezes the life out of you. You know what’s coming. You know you can’t stop it. And as horrific as the ending is, it had to be that way. It makes sense. The world is a fucked up place. Anyway, all you editors looking for the next greatest thing, go read Push, Push, Push by Ryan Sayles and publish it, so the rest of the world can be in the know. You can reach him at his personal email address ryan.sayles@gmail.com or his private cell phone number 510-379-8640. Again, you’re welcome.Posted byChris Rhatiganat9:05 AM   Blue skies,Les"},
{"title": "FINAL TWO PARTS OF DIALOG POSTS ON KRISTEN LAMB'S BLOG", "date": "Thursday, April 11, 2013", "text": "Hi folks,Below are the last two parts of the guest blogpost I did at the invitation of Kristen Lamb on her Warrior Writer blog.Hope they prove of some help in your own writing!From Kristen's blog...LesEdgerton & Two Tips to Take Your Dialogue to a WHOLE New Level–Part 3Posted by Author Kristen Lamb in Writing Tips on April 8, 2013 Hey,Guys. You wanted to learn how to write AMAZING, PAGE-TURNING DIALOGUE, so I kidnapped  recruited the best. Les Edgertonhas been so generous with his time and talent, and we are SUPER grateful. Ipromise to release Les back into the wild…eventually. Takeit away, Les!Thanks forhaving me back on, Kristen! There were several things I neglected to talk abouton dialogue in the first two posts, so I wanted to include them here. There aremany other elements of good dialogue than posted here, but these are kind ofimportant.Now, hereare the couple of things I neglected to cover in the first two posts.Formatwith TagsOne is theformat of dialogue with tags. I suspect that this one will draw as manyresponses from folks who don’t buy it as there were who resisted using “said”as dialogue tag verbs. It’s your choice—I’m just relaying the mindset of manyeditors.It’s verysimple. The accepted format fordialogue tags these days is “He/she/name said.” Almost always. What isconsidered archaic and musty is this construction: “Said he/she/name.”About theonly folks still using this latter format are some older journalists, somewriters from other cultures (Canada comes to mind), brand names, and writerswho haven’t kept up with current usages. Which leads me to make a big point—brand names—those authors with significantfollowings—can make every mistake in the book and get away with it.They’re beyond such limitations, simply because their readerships are such thatpublishers will accept just about anything they publish.StephenKing could probably publish his grocery list and it would hit the bestsellerlists… Although, King is such a terrific writer, he wouldn’t (and doesn’t)break very many of these rules and conventions. This is just to make you awarethat many times brand name authors aren’t always the folks to go to for writingmodels. Simply because they can get away with things that unknown writerscan’t.Thereality is, King can do things we can’t. Same goes for any brand name author.That doesn’t mean their work is valueless for instruction—it has immense value.There’s a reason they’re popular and it’s almost always the writing. But,always look at it with a grain of salt and become thoroughly familiar with thedirection fiction is taking because there are popular authors who haven’t keptup and whose books, if modeled for your own efforts, may work against you.Whenever Ihave a student point out an example in a published book that goes contrary tothe advice I’ve given them, my first question is: “Is this from a brand-nameauthor?” If it is, then I ask them to consider the source. And to gently letthem know that while it may not be fair, it’s the reality that we (unknowns)have to be better in many ways that established writers with significantfollowings don’t have to be.Ifanyone’s parents told them the world was fair, they did them a disservice…ConflictThe secondthing I neglected to touch on is conflict. We all know that there has to beconflict on every single page of a novel for it to work, and this is especiallytrue in dialogue. That’s why Q&A dialogue doesn’t work. There’s virtuallyno conflict in it.I advisemy novel writing students and clients constantly that the protagonist should never, ever gain anything easily, no matter howseemingly trivial the exchange is. An exampleI give often is to tell them that if they have their protagonist stop a bum onthe street to ask directions to a bar she’s pretty sure is a block or two awaybut isn’t sure in what direction, she should have the bum say something to theeffect of: “Whadda I look like, Sweetpea? The frickin’ Chamber of Commerce?”And, then, either give up the info grudgingly or walk off and let her find herown way. The point being,never let the protagonist gain things easily. Never.In dialogue, when the protagonist is trying to gain information, itshould be like pulling teeth. Now, that doesn’t mean there should be awar created to gain a simple piece of information. The writer needs to tailorthe conflict proportionally to the value of what she’s after.In theexample above, this is plenty. What she’s after is just a simple direction. Itdoesn’t rise to the level of WWIII. But… there should be at least a bit ofconflict and resistance to gain her answer. When the information is valuable, the conflict needs to be ratcheted upin proportion.This isone of the primary keys to creating tension and tension is the lifeblood of asuccessful novel. Nothingshould be gained easily and the opposition to her gaining it should beproportional to the value it holds. The other primary key to a qualityread is to keep posing story questions, one after another after another afteranother… ad nauseum.I’ve barelytouched on the subject, but hope there’s some food for thought here for mostreaders.The mainthing is—keep up on whatpasses for contemporary usages these days and keep those red flags to aminimum. And, remember, no one has ever written a perfect novel. Everysingle novel ever published has flaws. Perfection is an impossible goal. Can’tbe done. Just get it as good as you possibly can and send it out. And begin ona new work and try to make it even “gooder.”Remember: When you’re green, you’re growing. And, when you’reripe, you’re rotten. Writing has changed greatly in the pastten-twenty years and it’s going to keep on changing. What I said here—at leastsome of it—will eventually be outdated. It’s one reason to keep readingvoraciously and to keep reading craft books.Hope thishelps!Blueskies,LesLes,THANK YOU SO MUCH. For my readers, Les will be back tomorrow with some finaladvice about your writing and your careers as authors, so I hope you’ll joinus.AFinal Word from Les Edgerton–Fortune Favors the PreparedPosted by Author Kristen Lamb in Writing Tips on April 9, 2013 Today,is Les Edgerton’s last post in this series. We’ve been extraordinarily blessedto learn from him, so I hope y’all will give him a digital hug or round ofapplause. Les will soon be teaching on-line classes for WANA, so I’ll let youknow when those are available.Takeit away, Les!All of thepoints we’ve covered in this dialogue series are intended for one purposeonly—to help writers avoid the red flags that improper dialogue can create foragents and editors… and readers.And that’swhat they are—red flags. That doesn’t mean that breaking any of these “rules”or conventions will doom your mss from being taken, but it does mean thepresence of them can cast a negative light on your work. And, I imagine we allwant to avoid that!Also,there will be a great many examples of novels that break these precepts. Thereare many reasons for that. Contrary to popular opinion, novels don’t make itinto print simply because they’re quality writing. There are many other factorsat work. Factors that the writer may or may not have control over.Forinstance, novels are published because the author has made a personalconnection with a publisher. When an editor knows someone and likes thatperson, it’s not uncommon for that person’s book to be taken over another moreworthy one. Happens all the time.Or, anauthor may have had one or more successful novels already published and thecurrent one may not be as good as the mss lying on the same desk as an unknownauthor, but the lesser quality novel will be taken. Again, happens all thetime.Sometimes,even though the novel breaks all kinds of rules, something in a novel like thismay simply appeal to an individual editor. Maybe it’s the voice. Maybe it’s thesetting—my first novel was taken by accident because of its setting. TheDeath of Tarpons had been rejected 86 times before I sent it to theUniversity of North Texas Press.That’sEIGHTY-SIX times!That wasin the days of snail mail submissions, where you had to pay the postage for themss to the editor and also provide return postage. That was during a time whenmy family ate a lot of beans and really couldn’t afford to buy the tons ofstamps I needed. I had made my mind up that once I reached 100 rejections, Iwould “retire” the manuscript.Whathappened was that it landed on the desk of UNT’s publisher, Fran Vick.Unbeknownst to me at the time, UNT had never before published fiction. If I’dknown that, I never would have sent it. Anyway, Fran’s secretary had unwrappedthe day’s mail and as it by chance happened, mine was the first mss on Fran’sdesk. Her normal routine when presented with a fiction mss, was for her to noteven read it, but just stick a standard rejection notice in it and have hersecretary send it back.Luck wason my side!As Franrelated to me later (I’ve just revealed a happy ending and taken all thetension out of this, haven’t I!), her secretary was bringing her her morningcup of coffee and something happened where she had to remake the pot. That gaveFran an extra five minutes or so before she began her “official” day, so, forwant of anything else to do, she picked up the first page of my novel and beganidly to read it. If it wasn’t for her secretary’s failing to deliver her thatcup of coffee, none of what happened next would have ever happened.It’s whatshe read on that first page that induced her to keep reading. The novel was setin Freeport, Texas, the town I grew up in. Like most first novels, it was anautobiographical, “coming-of-age” novel (there’s a cliché for ya!). The thingis… Freeport was Fran’s hometown!Whateditor can resist reading about their own hometown, especially when that townis a tiny burg like Freeport? A New York City editor, glancing at the firstpage of a mss and seeing it’s set in NYC isn’t going to be nearly as intriguedas an editor from Freeport, Texas reading a novel set in… Freeport, Texas!As itturned out, Fran also knew my grandmother who was prominently on the pageimmediately and was instantly drawn into the story and read it all the waythrough, got on the phone, and offered to buy it.So,there’s luck involved sometimes. Although, the book was well-written, so italso pays to be ready for luck when it appears. Fortune favors the prepared! The book went on to bewell-reviewed and sold very well and earned a Special Mention from the VioletCrown Book Awards.The pointis, there are so many factors out of your control that can lead to or preventpublication. But, there are factors that you can control and among them areadhering to contemporary writing styles and conventions. And that is theimpetus behind these precepts. To help you avoid many of the red flags that mayprevent your mss from getting a fair and thorough reading.Okay? Bestof luck to all of you and your writing endeavors!Blueskies,LesLes,THANK YOU SOOOOO MUCH. We really appreciate you taking so much time from yourpacked schedule.KristenLambAnd there you have it, folks. Hope you enjoyed the posts.BTW, so far, THE RAPIST has garnered 22 reviews on Amazon and every single one has been five stars! I'm stoked! Blue skies,Les"},
{"title": "GUEST POST ON WARRIOR WRITERS ON SUBTEXT", "date": "Saturday, April 6, 2013", "text": "Hi folks,Below is Part II of the guestblog I did for Kristen Lamb for her blog Writer Warriors. It contains an exercise teachers can use for their writing classes on how to write dialog with subtext (off-the-nose dialog). Hope it helps!Click HERE for the post on Kristen's blog, along with the comments which were amazing.From Kristen's blog: Les Edgerton Shows How to WriteAmazing Dialogue–Part 2 AN EXERCISEI hope youguys enjoyed Les’s guest post yesterday. Today, Les is offering abonus…an EXERCISE to help you develop your skills for writing killer dialogue.Take itaway, Les!Exerciseon SubtextThisexercise is primarily for the teacher teaching basic writing principles,although perhaps even more advanced writers may get something out of it. It’san exercise I use in my “on-ground” classes when I’m teaching at a college.Itrepresents a very basic example of dialogue that’s not “on-the-nose” or aQ&A exchange, to show students a very easy to understand example of howoff-the-nose dialogue works and how subtext informs the dialogue more than theactual dialogue.I usuallyhave two students come to the front of the room and read the following script.Then, I ask the questions that follow. It’s a simple exercise, but I’m happy toreport that most of the students really enjoy coming up with their ownexchanges, which is part of the assignment.If anyoneuses this in an actual class, I’d love to hear your feedback. (Also, you maywant to write your own example—I admit this isn’t deathless prose, but hey! Iwrote it in about five minutes. Gimme a break…)DIALOGUE EXERCISEShe: TheBentley’s baby was cute, wasn’t it?He: Idon’t think I saw it. I was in the kitchen with the guys all night.She: Well,she was a cute little baby.He: Great.Women think all babies are cute. Ever heard a woman say someone’s kid was ugly?I mean, except for Shrek’s parents’ friends?She: Bradand Gena seem so happy.He: Theyshould be. He just got a promotion.She:Silly! I mean the baby.He: Theregoes the promotion. The raise part of it, anyway.She: Ithink they’ll manage. Babies are worth a sacrifice or two.He: If yousay so.She: Lookat it practically. Their little girl will probably take care of them in theirold age.He: That’sa great tradeoff. Let’s see… take care of a kid for 22 years—I’m includingcollege—and they stick you in a home for your final three years. Probably useyour own money to fund your own old folks’ home. Sounds like a good deal.She: It’snot like that.He: Yeah.Whatever.Silencefor a few seconds.She:Samantha.He: Huh?She:Samantha. They named her Samantha. I think that’s cute. I wonder if they’llcall her “Sam.”He: Theyought to call her “Stinky.”She: What?He: Youheard me. “Stinky.” The kid smells.She: Allkids smell when they make a mess. You smelled. Besides, how would you know ifshe smelled? You said you stayed in the kitchen.He: Allkids smell.She: Thenyou change their diaper.He: Yeah.There goes the entertainment budget.She: Youmean the beer budget.He: So?She: So isif you cut out a few beers, you’d have plenty of diapers… and lose a fewpounds…He: Yousayin’ I’m fat?She: I’msaying diapers don’t cost that much. A six-pack or two.He: Maybe.But how many six-packs does it cost to send a kid to college?She(laughing): About what you go through in a week!He(mutters): Must be a cheap school. All the classes on the Internet? Theschool’s in the Caribbean?She:She’ll probably get scholarships anyway.He: That’scool. That means she’ll spend all her time partyin’. End up pregnant.She:She’ll be way too smart for that.He: Likeher mom was?Who werethis man and woman really talking about? What did the woman want? What did theman want? Did either of them come right out and say what they were reallytalking about?This isdialogue that isn’t “on the nose.” It’s one way good dialogue is written.What’s important is what isn’t said–the subtext. The subtextis the real message that’s under the surface of the actual dialogue spoken.This iswhat I want you to write (in teams). Two people talking about something that isreally being expressed in subtext—dialogue that’s not “on the nose.” You canpick any subject you want for them to discuss (within reason!). Whateverthey’re really talking about can’t be mentioned. After you deliver yourdialogue, the class will attempt to guess what it is you’ve really been talkingabout.Time:2-3 minutes performance time per person. I’d rehearse this so your team fallswithin the time limit. That’s where I’ll take the most points off, for beingshort of the minimum.Notes:You don’t need to memorize the exchange but can read off your script.Bonuspoints: Your team can gain bonus points if you use props and/orcostumes. (I’ve had some really original costumes and propsshow up…)Hope thishelps understand better what subtext is and what off-the-nose dialogue is.Write solid subtext dialogue and you’ll draw comparisons to folks like ElmoreLeonard!Bonustips: Nothing to do with dialogue but just two tips to becoming abetter writer.1.Don’t show a “single tear coursing down the cheek” of a character. It isn’tdramatic; it’s a cliché. It’s a moronic cliché. Plus, it makes the readerwonder if the other tear duct is clogged or if only one tear shows a personwith some kind of half-ass control over their emotion where they can controlone eye but not both at the same time…2.Don’t ever write a sentence like: I wonder if he’ll like me, shethought to herself. I mean… who else does a person think to other than themselves?Unless it’s a sci-fi novel and people can think to others…These twothings are my personal bugaboos in writing. I throw up in my mouth whenever Iencounter these puppies! Sometimes, I do more than just choke up a bit of bile.At times, I’ve hurled chunks when encountering these in a student’s work… Justsayin’…Thank you Les for this wonderful exercise. I am trying to twist Les’s armfor a Part Three on Monday, so here’s hoping .Kristen Lamb LesEdgerton is the author of HOOKED,  THE RAPIST, THE BITCH and others.Thanks for reading, folks. Hope it helps give you another way to see subtext.Blue skies,Les"},

Some writers have an instinct for writing great dialogue, butfor others it takes hard work to achieve believable and interesting dialogue.But, no matter if it comes naturally to you or if you have to work long andhard to be able to create convincing dialogue, it can be achieved by almosteveryone.Because of space limitations, Iwon’t be able to cover everything necessary to achieve mastery, but will covermany of the main facets.What Good Dialogue Isn’t—It Ain’t aQ&AThe worst form that a dialogueexchange can take is in the form of a Q&A. That: “Hi, how are you?”“Fine, how are you?”“Good. How was your day?”“It was great. I went shopping andbought a new pair of shoes. What’d you do”“Oh, I watched TV and took a nap inthe afternoon.”And so on, ad nauseum. On-the-nosedialogue. One of the worst forms it can take. Dialogue becomes even worsewhen it becomes an info dump. Try always to avoid direct question andanswer responses. It’s one of the biggest killers of effective dialogue.White Space---SubtextDialogue is one of the elements infiction that require lots of “white space” to work well. White space in thisdiscussion refers to what is not on the page. The most importantcomponent in great dialogue isn’t so much what’s on the page but what isn’t.The very best dialogue consists of thesubtext. Successful screenwriters realizethis probably better than anyone. In fact, one of the chief reasons screenplaysget a pass instead of a consider is that the dialogue is couched in Q&Aformat.One of the requirements of gooddialogue is that it gives the appearance of real speech, not that it imitates it. Real speech is full of ers and ums andhesitations and going off on tangents and dozens of other elements that, ifincluded would destroy its effectiveness.Listen to a court reporter’stranscript of a trial or better, listen to the taping of criminals when theydon’t know they’re being recorded. It’s almost impossible to sort through allof the extraneous baggage real speech carries. Fiction dialogue has to be much, much better than realspeech and the aim is only to give the illusion of real speech, not totranscribe it the way actual speech is delivered.Look at how two people who knoweach other well converse. It’s chockfull of subtext. Not to mention bodylanguage and facial expressions and other physical clues that inform the speechthat can’t be delivered on the written page, at least not without coming acrossas cluttered at best.Notice how people “talk around”things—especially those topics that are emotional landmines. They’ll say everything but what’sreally on their mind. The proverbial “elephant in the room.” That’s subtext.Perhaps the best way to illustrate what subtext is is to provide an exercise Igive my classes on that very thing (tomorrow). Writing teachers might find ituseful in teaching dialogue.Other Dos and Don’ts of GoodDialogue1. Actor’s BusinessDon’t give your characters whatthey call in the stage play arena, “actor’s business.” Don’t have yourcharacters rubbing their noses, lighting up cigarettes, raising their eyebrows,wiping perspiration off their brows… unless it contributes to the scene andrepresents something other than just giving them something to do with theirhands.Basically, don’t just write thingsin just to vary the narrative. It’s obvious, it’s amateurish, and it doesnothing but make the reader aware someone is writing the story, therebyinterrupting the fictive dream.2. Info DumpsDon’t use dialog to provide infodumps. In other words, don’t have characters telling each other things theyboth already know. Real people don’t do that and neither should yourcharacters. Find other ways to deliver necessary info and not via dialog. Also,it just sounds plain dumb… kind of like one moron talking to another moron.3. Use “Said” for Your Dialogue TagVerbs, 99.9% of the TimeThis is very important. The word“said” has been used so often over the millennia, that it’s no longer seen as aword by readers, but almost as a form of nonintrusive punctuation. As a word it’s become invisible.Using said for just aboutall of your tags allows the dialogue to work unimpeded and won’t make thereader aware that a writer is at work, which they’ll realize when they startseeing synonyms for said. Using other synonyms is a red flag to editorswho realize they’re reading the work of an amateur and one who hasn’t kept upon the conventions of contemporary fiction.Those synonyms also include verbs likeasked, replied, answered and the like. The reader sees clearly that it’s a question or in replyto a question by the punctuation used and/or from the content or context of thedialogue. About the only exceptions to the word said are verbs such as whispered,shouted, yelled and the like.And whatever you do, don’t usedialogue tag verbs that are physically impossible! Don’t have your speaker chortling words, for instance.Try to chortle a sentence out loud and you’ll see what I mean.And don’t feel you have to usedialogue tags for every speaker, every time. Use emotional clues, physicalclues, the context of the speech to identify the speaker as much as possible.But, do be sure the speaker’s identity is clear. There’s nothing worse than a reader in the midst of alongish exchange who suddenly doesn’t know who spoke the last line and has tostop and backtrack to figure out who’s speaking!4. Use Contractions in YourCharacter’s SpeechNobody speaks with perfect speech,not even Princeton professors. We all use contractions in speech. Nothing soundsmore wooden than perfect speech. The only exception is when you intend toportray the character as a pedant, but I’d be careful even there. Such acharacter will quickly become boring.5. Don’t Phoneticize Regional orCultural or Racial Dialects.The days are long gone from whenMark Twain phoneticized Jim’s speech. Not done these days. Today, we use anoccasional idiomatic word or occasional particular syntax to convey aparticular dialect. A word or two used judiciously is all that’s needed. Thereader will fill in the blanks in their minds.6. Don’t Include HousekeepingDetails and Minutia in Your DialogueIn phone conversations, forexample, only include the one or two sentences that are important to the story.Don’t include the character dialing, or answering or hanging up the phone. Justend the conversation and only include the truly important dialogue andsummarize the rest.We just don’t need to see the“hellos” and “goodbyes” or the mundane social chatter some calls include. Andthen end the conversation with a bit of important speech. Don’t show themhanging up. As readers and people who talk onphones often, we kind of know they hung up the phone…7. Read Authors Who are Renownedfor Their DialogueRead those writers who areacclaimed for their superlative dialogue. Folks like Elmore Leonard.There’s a reason they have these reputations. Study what they do that makestheir dialogue come alive and incorporate those techniques into your ownefforts.There are many other techniques tocreating great dialogue, but space restricts how many I can cover here.

{"title": "Review of THE RAPIST by Renee Miller for On Fiction Writing", "date": "Friday, March 29, 2013", "text": "Hi folks,The reviews are piling up! I’m delighted toshare a new review of THE RAPIST just posted on the On Fiction Writing site, byCanadian reviewer/writer Renee Miller. It’s especially gratifying in that she firstdecided to read it with a bit of a negative frame of mind and confessed that afterthe read she’d changed her mind 180 degrees. Plus, she commented that the “voice”in it was, “quite simply, breathtaking.” That makes me feel extremely good,considering that voice is one of my biggest concerns as a writer.Here’s what shehad to say:The RapistBy: Les Edgerton  Reviewed by OFW chief editor:   RenéeMiller Published: March 29, 2013From the cover:The Rapistintroduces us to Truman Ferris Pinter, an amoral man occupying a prison cellfor a heinous crime committed years earlier. Master storyteller Les Edgertonguides us on a haunting journey inside the criminal mind to show that no matterhow depraved a person appears to be, there might still exist a spark ofhumanity.It is theselines (Well, after the startling title and image that made me read the backcover.) which tempted me into buying “The Rapist.” The quiet dare that hidesinside “…no matter how depraved a person appears to be, there might stillexist a spark of humanity.”Pfft, I thought.So he thinks he’s figured out how to make a rapist appear human to me? I’lltake that challenge. In “The Rapist” Les Edgerton takes the reader deep insidethe disturbing mind of Truman Pinter. The clincher, or the hook that reels youinto this story, is the uncertainty as to whether or not Pinter is responsiblefor the crime he’s convicted of. In simpler terms: while you may not doubt hisguilt, you’re uncertain as to whether he deserves his punishment. I’m not going tolie, I’m kinda jealous of what Edgerton achieves in this novella. The writingis tight, and what many authors (including myself) would’ve drawn out over 300pages or so, Edgerton cut in half. He keeps only the things that matter to thischaracter and this story. And I have toadd that I felt the “voice” in this book is, quite simply, breathtaking.Edgerton takes what should be a sordid, creepy read and makes it beautiful.Although I have long believed that without civilization humanity wouldn’t bequite so tame, I would never have guessed I’d read such a vile character andempathize with him.I think the writing style and voice play a part in that. Ifound myself trying to think up ways that would make what he’s accused of“okay.” I knew it wasn’t, but somehow I wanted it to be because…I liked him.Yes, my skin still crawls at the fact. In the back of my mind, I was alwaysaware of just how amoral he is. The key (I think) to his appeal is in hischarmingly brutal honesty. Pinter never denies anything, nor does he really tryto explain it away. I respected that.Aside from histight grasp of the craft, what really impressed me about Edgerton is that thisstory took balls to write. The themes and ideas in “The Rapist” are the verythings that make the bleeding hearts that are always eager to take offensepractically orgasmic in their shit losing. But this story is not aboutoffending people. It’s not about taking a voyeuristic trip inside the mind of asicko. It’s not about exploiting the crimes he committed. In my opinion “TheRapist” is about making you look inward. It challenges your personal morals andbeliefs on many levels, and forces you to acknowledge that while everyone does badthings, some worse than others, we’re all human. We all share feelings, fears,thoughts and biases with even the lowest criminal. That fact is so disturbingand unpleasant that we choose to ignore it. After all, if we embrace suchthings, we must also concede that it’s possible for such darkness to lurkinside all of us.I recommend “TheRapist” as a dare to all of you who claim to be open-minded. Offense takers cando whatever you please, because you usually do. The rest of you, I dare you topick up this book and read the white space. That’s where the true story is. Asfor Edgerton, I am definitely a fan and have a much longer to-read list becauseof it.Well, there yougo! Thank you so much, Renee. Hope those who read it enjoy it as well.Blue skies,Les"},
{"title": "REVIEW OF THE RAPIST FROM CRIME FICTION LOVER", "date": "Wednesday, March 27, 2013", "text": "Hi folks,I'm totally stoked! Just got a great review for my novella, THE RAPIST, from one of the most respected crime/noir sites in the world, the venerable Crime Fiction Lover in the UK! Here's what \"RoughJustice\" had to say. I have to confess I don't know what Rough Justice's real name is, but I've always found his reviews to be spot on and great writing in themselves.The RapistBy  RoughJustice ⋅ March 27, 2013 ⋅  Writtenby Les Edgerton – Les Edgerton has written several acclaimed hardboiledcrime novels and instructional books for writers, as well as teaching creativewriting at the university level. But it’s inevitably his colourful past thatinterests me most. Back in his younger days he was a professional criminal whodid time for burglary, and his experiences lead a certain authority to hiswriting.However,anyone expecting something similar to the books of other famous writers with acriminal past – Edward Bunker, author of The Animal Factory, for instance – isgoing to be surprised. The crimes here are more extreme and unsavoury thanthose of Edgerton or Bunker, for sure. But more than that The Rapist is a novelthat defies convention in many ways. Leave your preconceptions behind, andyou’ll be all the better for it.The Rapistis narrated by Truman Ferris Pinter who is serving out his last hours on deathrow before his execution. We learn the circumstances of his crime – the rapeand murder of Greta Carlisle. Prior to his crimes, he’d watched her having sexwith three men in public while he masturbated, concealed behind a tree. Thefollowing day Greta came across him fishing in a secluded spot and after hisawkward attempts at communication, she taunted him and revealed that she knewhe was watching. According to Truman, she fell on a stone into the river anddrowned while he walked off making no attempt to save her.We learnsome contradictory things about his childhood. His mother was overbearing and smothering,and his father was frequently away from the family home, but loving. There arehints, however, that his father was an addict who beat his wife and that Trumanmay have killed him in his sleep. As the hours pass to bring his executionnearer, Truman confides in us his plans. It seems that he developed the abilityto levitate then fly as a child, and though these powers left him as he gotolder and lost his innocence, they have returned since he was wronglyincarcerated.Trumantruly believes that he didn’t murder Greta, merely let her die, and whilst headmits taking Greta against her will, it cannot be rape when he is so superiorto her. His plan is to fly away on the morning of his execution. He willliterally and metaphorically rise above the prison, society and their pettylaws. He will then return to be executed, and show them how little theirpunishment really means.Hopefullythis gives you a flavour of this extraordinary book. At times it is nauseating,at others a little bewildering but always ambitious, imaginative and thoughtprovoking. The tone if not the narrative puts me in mind of the disorientatingLew Griffin series by James Sallis, or The Eye of the Beholder by Marc Behm.No-one could pretend this is an easy read – I certainly wouldn’t – but kudosmust go to New Pulp Press for publishing this brave and challenging book.You cansee where the author works by clicking here.New PulpPressPrint/KindleThanks, RoughJustice and Crime Fiction Lover! You made my day!Blue skies,Les"},
{"title": "GORDON RAMSEY'S NOVEL-WRITING INSTRUCTION", "date": "Saturday, March 23, 2013", "text": "Hi folks,What? You didn’t realizeChef Gordon Ramsey taught writing? The fact is, he’s one of the best writingteachers in the world.He disguises it by claimingto reach cooking, but if you understand the code he’s using in hispresentations on his show, KITCHEN NIGHTMARES, it’s all about writing.Actually, it’s about anyart form. The rules are pretty much the same, whether it’s in cooking,painting, writing, sculpting or music or anything else in the art world.Let’s take a look at hisshows and see how that works, okay?First, what’s almost alwaysthe chief reason the restaurant he’s called in to help out is failing? Whilethere are a variety of problems, without fail the primary one is that the foodthe restaurant is serving sucks. Let’s look at that one first and see how itrelates to writing.When he walks into afailing restaurant, the very first thing he does is order a meal. The food hewants to look at and taste is the same as the writing teacher looking at thestudent’s manuscript. To paraphrase a famous Presidential slogan: “It’s thefood, stupid.” Or, in our case as writers: “It’s the writing, stupid.”The quality of the food isthe single biggest obstacle to success for any restaurant. The quality of thewriting is the single biggest obstacle to success for any author.See where we’re going? Seehow the comparison starts to make sense?He begins with the foodbecause the truth is, if the food’s good, just about everything else can bewrong and the restaurant still has a chance of succeeding. Conversely, if everythingelse is perfect—the service, the décor, the location, et al—but the food sucks—allthe restaurant owner is going to have is a place that has a great waitstaff, anamazing décor, a prime location… and stands largely empty with those talentedwaiters and waitresses standing around picking their noses….It’s the same with writing.The manuscript can be perfectly presented with proper formatting and deliveredto the right gatekeepers—agents/publishers—but if the writing sucks, it won’tmatter. Two bites into the mss “meal” and if it doesn’t taste good, it’s headedfor the circular file, just like the food Ramsey sends back on that initialtasting is headed for the same circular file. What us literary types refer toas being “shitcanned.”What are the responses ofthe restaurant owners and chefs when Ramsey tells them their food sucks? It’spredictable. Most are in denial. Most are in way-huge denial. Almost to aperson, they feel their food is amazing. They’re convinced that the reasonsthey’re not rich yet is something else other than the food. The usual responsebefore he delivers his judgment on their menu is that he’ll come in, deliver afew “secrets” that will get them on their way to becoming a four-starestablishment. Does this remind you of anything? A new writer in your class orwriter’s group, perhaps? Who, before the critique begins is clearly there toglean a few “inside” writing or publishing tips so they can be on their way tothe bestseller lists or at least to be signed by an agent or sell their novel?Look at the responses hegets when he tells them he wouldn’t serve their food to a dog. Many (most?) getangry. It never dawned on them that they couldn’t cook well. In their minds, itwas always something else that prevented them from achieving a sold-outrestaurant every night. How dare Gordon criticize their work! See anycorrelation to a writer receiving criticism from a teacher or agent or editoror the writer’s group?The writer who is alsorighteously irate, thinks about all those people who told him his writing was “betterthan Joyce Carol Oates.” Folks like his family, his friends, the friendly facesin his writing group, his English teacher, his workmates. How could they all bewrong and this pretender (teacher/agent/editor) have such a different opinion?Maybe it’s because… this teacher isn’t connected to them emotionally and onlyjudges the product? And has higher standards? A better knowledge of what goodwriting consists of? And a version of Hemingway’s “built-in bullshit detector?”Maybe…There’s a superciliousteaching “method” some schools and venues want their writing teachers to adhereto, called by some the “sandwich” method. Start with a piece of praise bread,slip in a bit of criticism, and then finish it off with another piece of praisebread. Does this strike anyone else as perhaps a great example ofmollycoddling? Of treating writers less than adults? Schools do this for tworeasons. One, they want return customers (students). People who are toldbluntly that their work is bad often don’t return. Especially when there areplenty of places who will tell them they’re great. Two, they’ve bought intothis New Agey crap where teachers aren’t supposed to let their little chargesknow that among them are winners and losers. (Kind of like real life…) It’s themindset that awards “participation trophies” and bullshit like that. Like theschool recently in the news that cancelled their annual Honor Days because theones who didn’t achieve that level would “feel bad.” Well… so frickin’ what…When do you suppose that kids are going to learn that some people are smarterthan others, some have gifts others don’t share, some just work harder, andthere are even some folks who are smarter, more gifted and also work harder? Thatjust seems more of an USSR attitude than an American one, but I may feel thatway just because I’m not up on my Karl Marx reading… And don’t plan to be…That “sandwich” method ofteaching. Two pieces of praise, one piece of criticism. That kind of impliesthat everybody has two great things they’re doing in writing and only one bad.My experience is that often it’s the reverse ratio and I’ve had more than onebeginning writer in class who did nine bad things and only one good one. The “goodone” was showing up on time and that was about it. If that’s the case, then Iguess the teacher should make up things to praise them about. Wouldn’t thatdevalue honest praise? I mean, if a person is terrible at writing dialog andyou’re out of praiseworthy pieces of bread, should I tell him the only onewriting better dialog these days is Elmore Leonard?Can you imagine Gordonwalking into a restaurant and telling them, “Well, the third waitress on theleft is doing a great job. The food is atrocious. The bartender served me aperfect Gibson.” Don’t think so. A more likely scenario is that he tells the chef bluntly that his food is terrible and tries to treat him as an adult who can handle the truth. That many can't isn't his lookout. That's kind of their problem. They'll either develop a thick skin or they'll continue to serve bad food and blame others for their lack of success.Don't believe I've ever seen Ramsey serve a \"praise sandwich.\"There’s a reason writersdon’t have a writer’s union. Well, not one that many people belong to, anyway.It’s because most of us know you succeed by merit and hard work. Anorganization that’s predicated on the concept of “more money for less work andfewer hours at the expense of others” just isn’t suited for our temperaments asa rule.Okay. I’m off my soapboxnow…Another correlation Ramseyhas with good writing instruction is that he doesn’t differentiate betweenkinds or even levels of restaurants. He puts as much work into correcting aneighborhood bar and grill in a Midwestern town as he does a pricey Frenchrestaurant in NYC. He doesn’t try to make the neighborhood restaurant into theFrench restaurant or vice versa. No such thing as “literary” restaurants and “genre”restaurants. The only commonality in his mind is that they be the best they canbe within their parameters. He knows what constitutes great pub food just as heknows what great Japanese or Italian cuisines requires. Whether it’s ahamburger he’s creating or a soufflé, it’s all about the quality of theindividual dish. He thinks like Nabokov who said he didn’t acknowledge anygenres other than “good writing and bad writing.”He also insists the menu becontemporary. That dated dishes, even when prepared well, aren’t going to drawdiners. The same thing exists in literature. The writer who insists on creatingstories considered archaic or out of fashion, even if written well (within thestandards of that day) aren’t going to draw many readers. A writer whoabsolutely loves the “Dear Reader” style of Victorian literature may write asimilar book, but it just isn’t going to sell, any more than an epistolarynovel ala Samuel Richardson’s “Pamela” is going to be crowding anyone off theshelves at B&N. Time and again, Gordon encounters these dinosaurs who aretrapped in the past and spends days trying to dissuade them of the value oftheir effort.Watch his shows and see howoften he tells his charges to keep it simple, use fresh ingredients and don’tovercomplicate the recipes. Sounds kind of like Hemingway and Carver, doesn’tit? Or any number of brilliant writers. The first precept I give writers isthat one of the biggest keys to becoming a good writer is to pay attention totwo things: Make it clear and make it interesting. Kind of what Gordon saysabout good cooking…There are no synonyms forthe following words in either cooking or in writing:1. Bad2. Stupid3.Crap4. DullThey state plainly whatthey mean. There are words that mean the opposite and if a writer works hardenough and pays attention, they can change those descriptions of their writingto:1. Good2. Intelligent3. Entertaining4. Brilliant… but to change those wordsto the positive ones takes hard work, not unearned, empty words of praise. Justabout every writer starts out with the former words as being accuratelydescriptive of their writing. That’s no sin. What’s a sin is believing whenpeople tell you it’s the latter that describe the work when it doesn’t. Whenyour writing is consistently praised, I’d turn on the b.s. detector and trustit’s in working order.Watch Gordon Ramsey when heturns around a failing restaurant and imagine he’s instructing you as a writer.The lessons he imparts are exactly the same.Hope this gives you another source of writing education. It does me.Blue skies,LesP.S. If you just cleanedyour couch and found a few bucks in change, consider trekking over to Amazonand glomming onto a copy of THE RAPIST. I’d appreciate it!"},

{"title": "INTERVIEW WITH BENOIT LELIEVRE ON DEADEND FOLLIES", "date": "Thursday, March 21, 2013", "text": "Hi folks,BENOITLELIEVRE INTERVIEW ON THE RAPIST(Aspublished on Benoit’s Dead End Follies.Benoit conducts some of the best interviews onthe planet and it was a privilege to be asked to sit down with him and chat. Gotta warn you--Benoit presented this in four parts because of the length and it's presented en toto here.Question: Rapistsare the most abhorred criminals in our society, next to paedophiles. Whatmotivated you to write a first person narrative about one of them in yourlatest novel? Why did you decide to give a rapist a voice?Response:I have to warn you—my answers aren’t going to be politically correct and I’mgoing to piss some people off.First,it was never my goal to give rapists a “voice,” at least not in any significantway. I think of rapists pretty much as most folks do—as almost totallyreprehensible beings. In fact, I don’t see it as a book about rapists at all,but rather a book about time and space and God and human beings. I thoughtabout naming it The Memoir of JesusChrist but didn’t as that would take away the power of the last line, whichis what the book is really about. I did and do fully expect most people to seeit as a book about rape and a rapist and prison and all that stuff, but therewill be a few who I think will see it for what it was intended to be which is abook about the universe and God and how human beings fit in there and how it’sreally all fucked up and there’s not much we can do about it. I don’t want toomany of those folks, though. I hope most won’t be able to “get that.” If manydid, I wouldn’t have achieved what I set out to do. The people I really respectand who I wrote it for—people such as Cort McMeel—understood it immediately and that pleases me to no end. Just about every oneof the 31 blurbers got it perfectly and it’s those kinds of people I wrote itfor. I would never write something intended for everybody. I write for myspiritual and intellectual twin and like most of us, don’t have many of those.I wrote it for Cort and I wrote it for Charles Bukowski and people like that. I didn’t even send itout for publication for over twenty-five years (wrote it in the late eighties)as I was pretty sure it didn’t fit any commercial guidelines. I just kept it ina drawer until the right guy came along. That guy was Jon Bassoff of New Pulp Press.There are others I would have happily published it with, like Allan Guthrie or Brian Lindenmuth,but Jon was the best for this book, I felt.Theidea for his book came from a Charles Bukowski short story, “The Fiend.” It isthe most powerful, most honest, and most profound story I’ve ever read. Theinstant I finished it, I knew then that to write a story this courageous wouldbe the best thing I could ever do and I also knew I would have as hard a timein finding an audience for it as he did for his work before the Germansdiscovered him and published him when America wouldn’t. In fact, I didn’t evenconsider a U.S. publisher until I met Jon. I always thought it would find ahome some day with a French publisher. It’s a French book, you know.Intellectually. Perhaps Russian. The Russia of two centuries ago, not today.WhatBukowski did in that story was, to use an overworked word that in this case isprecisely correct; brilliant. He tookthat person you spoke of at the top—the odious pedophile—and showed through hisliterary, insightful, particular geniusthat no matter what depths a person has sunk to (or risen to), he is still oneof us. He is still human, no matter how grotesque and misshapen and evil hismind is. In this story, he wrote the single most illuminating line that hasever been written in literature. I’m not even going to use a qualifier for thatstatement such as “in my opinion.” It is just simply the clearest sentence everwritten in literature. An early line inthe story, spoken by the protagonist Martin as he is kissing the child, justbefore he rapes her, and the narrator says, “Martin’s eyes looked into her eyes and it was a communication betweentwo hells--one hers, the other his.” When I read this line, it was as ifI’d been struck by literary lightening.Bukowski reached out from beyond the grave and touched me with his hand withthose words and I knew then what I had to write.And, that’s how The Rapist came to be. My effort to write something as stark and honest and true asBukowski had.And, he’d already taken a“short eyes” as the character for his story, so all that was really left was arapist. Never considered a serial killer or mass murderer as a character—mostare really boring—all they do is keep repeating the same-o, same-o until they’recaught.The rape and the trial andall that are only the window dressing. It’s really a novel of how I see theuniverse. It’s a story about a God who is omniscient, but who is also really old, and has all of the infirmities ofage. After all, he made us in his image, according to the text, and I presumethat means he endowed us with all of the same things as he himself is endowedwith, including frailties and shortcomings along with all the strengths. It anovel explaining how time and space work. It’s chronological and at the sametime, it’s not. It’s here and it’s there and it’s somewhere else that we can’tsee because God hasn’t allowed us to see yet. It’s forever and ever and hasalways existed and it hasn’t yet begun and it’s already ended and that impliesa circle. I see it as a ball of yarn, not of one continuous strand, butcomposed of countless strands, all woven together. It’s the past, the presentand the future, all happening at once and yet not. It’s about a definition oftime that we don’t yet possess, beyond the three most recognize.What really struck meduring the editing is that the copy editor, Alice Riley, got what I was tryingto do. She pointed out that I vacillated between present and simple past andperfect past tense and wanted to know if that was on purpose as she suspectedit was. Because of the time element, you see? It told me that she got it. Thatwas an exciting moment for me. Most copy editors I’ve worked with probablywouldn’t have. They get the grammar and the spelling and syntax and all thatstuff, but they often don’t really get the literature.She got that it wasn’t intended to be a chronological story at all. That the“parts” weren’t meant to fit neatly. They were like the pieces of string theold man explained to Truman on the mountaintop. I hope I get some readers likeAlice. She understood that this was one of an unlimited number of memoirs thatJesus wrote. Is still writing. Hasn’t written yet. And, that he, like hisfather, got the pieces of time string mixed up sometimes. After all, they’rethe same guy. That the parts that are mixed up are from the pen of the thirdparty of the triune—the Holy Ghost. That poor guy never gets to get on stage,so I gave him some lines.Tried to show that Godhad/has/will have a sense of humor. Probably a French sense of humor…One more thing aboutBukowski that I thought of because of something you said in your question. Thatfirst-person thing. I thought that while his story was the bravest thing I’veever read, he kind of copped a deuce with it. In almost all of his work, hewrites from the first-person pov. In “The Fiend” he uncharacteristicallyemploys a third person. I don’t know if I’ve ever read a third-person storyfrom Bukowski other than this one. I think he got nervous at the last and wroteit in third because he was afraid someone would think he had that pedophile,hidden somewhere deep inside him, and he didn’t want people to ever think thatabout him. Because he didn’t. But, I think he was afraid that he might be viewedthat way. I think maybe he saw what happened to Nabokov with Humbert Humbert where Nabokov had to come out and make publicproclamations that, no, he wasn’t hiding a little Humbert deep down inside thathe drew from, and Bukowski didn’t want people to think the same kinds of thingsabout him about his character Martin. I decided I’d use first-person for thatreason. It’s like Bukowski and I had one of those bar fights he was famous forand this was my secret weapon to knock him out. It’s the brass knucks I hidfrom him and brought out when he wasn’t looking. And, since he’s roomtemperature and can’t do anything about it, I can claim I won.Question: Tell usabout the long, hard road to publication for THE RAPIST. I'm sure finding it a home wasn'teasy at all.Well, it was and it wasn’t.It was infinitely easier to find a publisher for this than it was for my firstnovel, The Death of Tarpons, which collected 86rejections before it found a home. And, that was by accident… On the right deskat the right time—the only five minute period it could have been there and beenread. And that book won literary awards, which always makes me wonder abouteditor’s and agent’s acumen… As does THE RAPIST. I mean, it got 31 blurbs from someof the best writers in the world and yet not a single Legacy 6 editor wantedit? Okay… I most likely would havefound a home for it years before I did, but you have to send it out for that tohappen. I wrote it over 25 years ago and it’s sat in a drawer, metaphorically,until now. I just didn’t think a U.S. publisher would see it as publishable. Inthe back of my mind, I kept thinking that once I got “established” (whateverthat is), that I’d have work translated and through that I could interest a foreignpublisher in it. I’ve always thought it fit the French mind better thananyone’s.When I found myself in theMFA program at Vermont College, my last-semester advisorwas Dr. Francois Camoin, a bona fide Frenchman. And, a bona fide literary genius. He was the firstperson I’d ever showed it to. He read it and then we had a drink together. Hetold me it was one of the most brilliant things he’d ever read, but that hefelt I’d have trouble finding a publisher. He delivered the same exact thoughtthat I had always had. He said he didn’t think it fit the sensibility of theAmerican reader. He felt they were more attuned to Stephen King and JohnGrisham and the like and just wouldn’t “get it.” Too dark. Too intellectual. Hewent on to say that he thought though that someday if I got lucky I would finda publisher—like me, he thought it would be a European publisher—and that, eventhough it would be hard to get it published, once it was he predicted it wouldwin all kinds of awards.Well, over the years since then,I showed it to a few people. Mostly whoever was my agent at the time. The thingis, most agents—even though they’re nice folks, usually—are pretty much attunedto the top of their quality scale being commercial stuff like James Patterson,and none of them understood the book. So, I stuck it back into that drawer. Andthen, I became friends with a guy who I think has the best literary mind ofanyone I’ve been privileged to meet. A guy named Cort McMeel. It took a lot bythat time for me to trust anyone. Certainly not an agent! Most of them—whilebeing nice people—could just as easily be selling Florsheim shoes—they’resalesmen and like the Ford salesman mostly want to move the latest car that’shot. There really are no more Maxwell Perkins out there… That’s not a bad thingand agents aren’t bad people. They’re just not the sort of people you want incharge of something that’s intellectual, as a rule. That’s a type of productthat’s outside their familiarity and comfort zone. They don’t want to representCamus—they want to represent James Patterson.Anyway, for the first timesince Dr. Camoin, I met someone who I felt had a genuine literary mind. So Iasked him if he wanted to read it. You’ll have to read the foreword which Cortgraciously provided for the book to see how that went.But… well. It went well. Heloved it. In fact, he wanted to publish it under the imprint he’d just begun,Bare Knuckles Press. And, we had a deal until he ended his association with the press. WithoutCort, I ended my own association with it. And, I happened on a new publisher.New Pulp Press. I chanced on a book of theirs that just blew me away. JakeHinkson’s Hell on Church Street. Blew me fucking away. I went to their list and went down the row and readevery single book publisher Jon Bassoff had published. Not a single clunker inthe bunch. Not one! I know of noother publisher who has the record Jon does. Probably Allan Guthrie—don’t thinkhe has a single book that isn’t brilliant. And Brian Lindenmuth. But, nobodyhad it like Jon did. That’s the guy I wanted to publish this book and it’sbecause of who he had already published. It was clear he was a guy who couldread silently without moving his lips. He wasn’t much interested in movingFlorsheim or Stacy-Adams shoes to make a buck… He actually understands andloves literature. Kind of a contemporary John Martin. I’m so glad I found him. And, like Martin, he even designed my cover himself.Damn—he really is John Martin!I sent it to Jon, he likedit and he’s publishing it. I’m as happy as a clam before the clam learnsthere’s a thing called clam sauce… Pretty fucking happy… I’m hoping he likestwo other works of mine he has on his desk and will want to publish them aswell.Question: I thinkmost of Dead End Follies' readers understand the purpose of true,groundbreaking shock value in fiction and THE RAPIST has a mouthful of it. Whatare the novels that shocked you and redefined your boundaries as an artist?Greatquestion! First and foremost, Camus’ TheStranger has influenced me more than any other single work. One of thebiggest things that struck me was how absolutely perfect it was. I think Camuspracticed Eastern philosophy upon it as he wrote it. That trope about how youalways include a small imperfection in any art form so that you don’t challengeGod. There’s a tiny imperfection in it, but I haven’t been able to find it yet.I keep looking though, because if it is, indeed, perfect, we may as well allgive up as what we’re after has been attained and that makes it a second-placething and who wants that?Second,there are a handful of novels that taught me how to write a novel. At least thekind of novel I wanted to write. Among those, I count Killshotby Elmore Leonard, A Feast of Snakesby Harry Crews, any and all of thecollections of short stories by Ray Carver , and The Last Good Kissby James Crumley. Most of Faulkner’s novels. More than any other novel or bookthough, has been the King James version of the Bible. It’s the basis for justabout everything we experience in our culture, even for the agnostics andatheists. It’s where our civilization comes from. I don’t know how anyone canpretend to know who they are if they don’t know the Bible. Doesn’t matter ifyou believe what it says or not. I’m not talking much about the religion in itin terms of its value. It’s the other things. The cadence of the poetry, forexample.Noneof these “shocked” me in any sense of the common definition. I can’t think ofany book that has ever done that. I’ve seen things in my life that are beyondanything I’ve ever read in a book. I’ll give you an early example. When I was12, I had already been working in my grandmother’s bar and restaurant eversince I could remember. It was a rough bar, what you’d call a honky-tonk, and Isaw pretty much everything you can think of in such a place. On my 12thbirthday, Grandma thought it was time I learned her cab business, so sheappointed me the night dispatcher. On my first night on the job, it was a slownight and the cabbies were all gathered outside the little shack where my phoneand clipboard and assignment sheet and all that stuff was. My little desk andchair. Well, they got to screwing around after awhile and one of them found adead rattlesnake—or maybe it was alive and he killed it—I don’t know. Anyway,he started waving it at another driver who didn’t know it was dead, and he wasterrified of rattlers and kept telling the guy to keep that snake off him, butthe other guy thought it was funny and kept tormenting him. Finally, the guywith the snake threw it at the scared guy and that man pulled out a pistol andshot him in the throat. About six feet away from me. Blood spurted everywhereand I got my share of it on me. Since I was the dispatcher, it was my job tocall the cops, which I did. That was in the days before 911, so I had to getthe phone book out, look up the number, and dial it and then tell the cops whathad happened. All without looking like some kind of pussy kid. Later, I wascalled to the witness stand to tell what I’d seen. After you see something likethat, what can be in a book that will shock you? Pretty much nothing. And,there’ve been lots and lots of experiences like that and far worse. So, I don’tanticipate ever reading anything in a book that will shock me in that way.BTW,the guy was acquitted and left town immediately. The dead guy had a lot offriends and relatives who didn’t like what had happened.Thatsame year I got whipped bloody by my father with a live king snake and I triedto kill a group of older Mexican kids with a .38 I stole from a sporting goodsstore when they attacked me and my best friend down on a submerged barge downat the Brazos River by the shrimp docks. Witnessed a lynching in a way. By thatI mean I was present when the sheriff was notified on the phone in our bar andknew from what he said what was going down. Remember watching him eat anotherpiece of pie with tiny bites after he got the call and told us what washappening and how when he finally left to go “stop” them, he drove away atabout five miles an hour. How you gonna stay down on the farm once you’ve seenParee? By which, I mean how are you going to shock me with lines in a book?Whatthose books did was shock me with their beauty and with their power. Their abilityto show a deep understanding of the human heart and the human soul. They gaveme a standard to shoot for and one that I knew wouldn’t be easy to attain.Ihave to take it back. I did read a book that shocked me and I just rememberedit. A collection of Bukowski’s stories. TheMost Beautiful Woman in Town and Other Stories. It wasn’t the content that shocked me. The content was just about drunksand whores and stuff like I knew about since I was little. It was learning thatthe kind of stuff I wanted to write could be published. I had just assumed itcouldn’t be because I’d never read anything like he wrote. He didn’t writeanything very shocking, compared to real life. That it could become published;that was what was shocking. And liberating. And sad. Sad, that I was in mythirties before I found out the free society I thought I had been living in,wasn’t. That there was censorship everywhere and had been going on for a longtime. Bukowski is the primary person who opened up the boundaries wide for me asa writer.Thanks,Chuck.Question: You madeno secret that you've had a hard life. In fact, you seem pretty candid aboutit. How has it brought you to writing? What made you sit down and writeseriously for the first time?It’sthe other way around, Benoit. It’s writing that brought me to a hard life, forthe most part. I’ve actively sought out the dangerous places in life and forone reason—material for my writing. It’s only when you’re close to death thatyou come fully alive.Isat down and began to write seriously when I was around four or five years old.Immediately after I was able to read the first book on my own, I decided atthat moment that being a writer was the only thing I ever wanted to do and Ihaven’t wavered one iota from that moment. At that time, I thought I couldwrite a better book than what I’d just read. I couldn’t then, but I think I cannow.Iactually taught myself to read. My mother would read me those insipidchildren’s stories and I’d ask her to trace the words with her finger as sheread so I could see where they came from on the page. They were really boringstories for the most part and trying to figure out the marks on the paper keptmy interest better. Actually, they were more than just marks. My grandmotherhad taught me my alphabet and how to spell and write my name when I was aboutthree and as half, so I had somewhat of an idea what words were. One day, Ijust continued out loud what my mother was reading—finished the sentence aheadof her. At once, she taught me phonics (the key to being a good reader, in myopinion). I was off to the races at that point.The first book I read on my own was a bookfrom my grandmother’s library. A collection of short stories by Guy deMaupassant. The first story I read was his “Two Friends.” He was imminently accessible,even to a small child. He just wrote plainly and clearly. I loved that book! My grandmother came inone day when I was reading it—actually, I’d stolen it from her library—and shetook me up to the attic where she kept all of her books and told me I couldread any of them I wanted to. She had a wonderful library. Most of the greatFrench and Russian writers and that’s who I began with. She also had someDickens but I couldn’t get into him at all.This kind ofruined school for me from the start. The teacher would have us reading thesereally godawful books—stuff by James Fennimore Cooper in junior high, forinstance—quite possibly the lousiest major writer in U.S. letters—it’s nowonder his work was made into early movies—it was “direct to video” writing. Iloved Robert Louis Stevenson and Mark Twain, but Cooper was purely boring andhis language was juvenile and just plain bad. When we had English classes, wewere required to read books that were infantile and I couldn’t stand plowingthrough them. I’d bring in my own books and hide them inside the crap we weresupposed to read. I remember being caught in second grade—we were all supposedto be silently reading some kiddie crap and I had secreted a copy of a Stendhalbook inside the book we were supposed to be reading, probably his TheCharterhouse of Parmawhich I loved, and theteacher went ballistic. She called a meeting with my mother and told her I wasdefying her by reading a book not on the reading list—and that I couldn’tpossibly “understand” it. We went back home and she told my grandmother whobecame incensed. She said she knew my teacher all her life and she’d alwaysbeen a moron and thought everyone else was on her level. She called her up andread her the riot act and the upshot was I was allowed to sit by myself in acorner and read whatever I wanted while the rest of the class read the“approved” books. My grandmother, Louise Vincent, was one of the biggestbusinesswoman in town—she owned and ran a hugely busy bar and restaurant and acab company, as well as owned a fortune’s worth of gas and oil and sulphurstocks and rental properties—and if she said something, people in townlistened. I remember every year we’d go to New Orleans to Maison Blanche and they’d close the entire store whilemy grandmother and mother and my sister and I spent the day as the solecustomers while models paraded the new fashions before them for Grandma and mymother to buy. Some little twit of a grade school teacher wasn’t going to makeher grandson read The Hardy Boys Punk Ass Clubhouse or whatever.In summers, we’dgo to Louisiana to stay on my great-grandmother’s ranch which was the world’slargest Brahma bull-raising enterprise in the country. Those were greatsummers! My grandmother’s first cousin was U.S. Senator Allen Ellender and he was often there with otherpoliticians and dignitaries. She was Louise’s mother and had an even biggerlibrary than my grandmother’s and also gave me full access to it. She had morecontemporary writers on her shelves than Grandma did—writers like Faulkner andHemingway and Fitzgerald, who Grandma considered “sensationalist” and “trashy.”I couldn’t stand Fitzgerald (still can’t), but loved Faulkner when I first readhim when I was I think, nine years old. Hemingway, I recognized as he seemed towrite a lot like Stephen Crane who I also liked a lot. She also had a lot ofgood European writers like Balzac.I’ve gone farafield of your question, haven’t I! Sorry. The thing is, I began reading veryearly, decided instantly that all I ever would want to do was to be a writer,and decided the best way to do that was to adopt the Jack London School ofWriting. To always seek out new experiences. And, that’s what I’ve done all mylife. I had one of my five wives after we’d divorced say, “You only married mefor material, didn’t you?” To which, I replied, honestly, “Yes.” She was myfirst wife, a black woman I’d married in Bermuda where I was living at the timein the sixties.I joined theNavy and afterwards began a life of crime, both for ostensibly the same reason.Experiences for material for my writing. Just about everything I’ve done inlife was toward the same end—to accumulate material for my writing. And, sinceI had little interest in writing about the life and times of insurance salesmenor college professors, that pursuit usually led me to more nefariousenvironments. Who in their right mind wants to live in the suburbs and mowtheir lawns when they could be breaking into Joe’s Bar and Grill at one in themorning? Or working for an escort service and vacationing in Puerta Vallarta onsome rich lady’s dime? Well, more accurately, what writer would opt forthe ‘burbs over that?Question: So if Iunderstand well, you chose writing and constant seeking of new experience, butthe fact you ended up in legal trouble, would it be fair to say crime fictionchose you? How have you ended up wanting to write about violence and the darkerside of the human condition? Was there a triggering event?I had to laugh, Benoit.“Legal trouble?” That sounds like I was sued for not cutting my grass oftenenough by the neighborhood association... I was a felon, pure and simple. And aconvict and then, an ex-con. The “legal trouble” came from committingburglaries, armed- and strong-armed robberies, selling drugs, etc. Cracking adude over the head with a crowbar. Stuff like that.And, yes, there was atriggering event, sort of. I had always written about the darker side of life,mostly because that was what I’ve always seen and been exposed in my existence.But, for a long, long time,I hid my past from everyone. And never wrote about the truly dark stuff. At thetime, I just assumed it would hurt me, especially in publishing. I had no ideafor the longest time that editors and publishers actually like real-lifecriminals as their authors! Half my agents never knew I did time or had heldpeople up or outran the cops in high speed car chases or been in prison. Whichmeant that my stories, while dark, didn’t go into the really dark stuff I’dexperienced.Even in my first novel, The Death of Tarpons, which is about anabusive father and that boy’s struggle to find himself, was presented asfiction, even though it was about 85% true and from my own boyhood. And“cleaned up,” quite a bit from much of the horror that was my childhood. Infact, I had a publisher who offered me a $10,000 advance back in themid-eighties for it, with the proviso I would allow him to put it out asmemoir. I told him I couldn’t because it was only 85% factual. He was okay withthat and still wanted it presented as memoir, and the reason I eventually didpull it from him was that he wanted to take out some parts that would “offend somereaders.” In particular, a scene where the boy’s father beats him with a liveking snake. In his words, it “might offend the snake lovers.” This was in thedays before we even had the term “politically correct” and this asshole was wayahead of the times, I guess. Offend the snake lovers? That’s gotta be what?Five or six people? Like, who gives a shit about some frickin’ snake lovers?Plus, it was a true event and it was integral to the story so I told him,thanks, but no thanks, and pulled it. When I could have used ten dollars, muchless ten thousand. But, what price is one’s integrity?Anyway, I held back in thatbook, simply because I thought it would hurt my chances at publication if Iexposed too dark of an environment, especially if it was factual.Keep in mind, this was theeighties and an entirely different climate than today. Today, I know a wholelot more about what publishers want than I did then.What changed everything forme was first reading Charles Bukowski and realizing for the first time thatwhat I really wanted to write about could be publishable.The second event occurredin talking to Diane Lefer whom I chose for my adviser twice for myMFA at Vermont College. I ended up trusting her enough that I revealed mybackground to her. To my shock she told me that my past was a decided plus inpublishing. Knocked my socks off when I heard that. And, that’s when I begangoing to the really cool events in my life.Diane opened my eyes to alot of things. Once, she asked me what I thought about a writer whom I won’tname, but who is renowned for writing dark and even criminal stories. Thisguy’s won about everything out there and kind of acts the tough guy. I told herthat my impression of him from his writing—I’d never met him in person—was thathe was a phony… and a bit of a poser and a pussy. That he tried to exude thispersona of a bad ass or even a criminal, but that his writing gave him away toone who’d actually done time… i.e., moi. I told her he sounded like a guy whodrew mostly from the experience of maybe doing a few days in the city jail fordrunk and disorderly, but he’d never been close to the inside of a real prison.That his idea of being bad, came mostly from hanging out maybe at titty barsand the like. She said she was glad to hear that, because even though shedidn’t have experience herself with the criminal life, his books had alwaysstruck that same chord in her.But, he enjoys this“persona” of being the “real deal,” and he isn’t even remotely close. I’ve runinto writers like him since. A lot of them, actually. Whose idea of a criminalis the little drug dealers in their neighborhoods, most of whom are littlesuburbanite punks trying to supplement their allowances from Mommy and Daddy.Or from hanging out at stripclubs, maybe, thinking that the guys who frequentthose places are some kind of real criminal element. Usually, the kind of guywho hangs out in those places is a loser of the nth degree and real criminalsmostly laugh at them. Not saying that some of these guys don’t do criminalacts—some do—but really aren’t the kind of truly scary dudes you’re going to becelling with.And meth and crack dealers?Gimme a break. These are just the bottom of the criminal barrel. Why wouldanyone think they’re remotely interesting unless their own lives are utterlyboring? They’re the far-fringe, unsuccessful moonshine dealers of yesteryear.Hillbilly wannabes who think that because they own a gun and have shot someonethat they’re the baddest thing on the planet. Nothing bad ass about most ofthem at all. Dumb as a box of hammers is the image that springs up in my mind.Pretty easy to figure out, as a rule. They don’t scare anybody except for thosewho grew up in suburbia. I guess they seem exotic to ‘em… Must be because that seemsto be the audience for these kinds of fiction. About all that happens in a lotof those books is a lot of gratuitous violence that seems to be there mostlyfor the shock value.Back to your question. Iwrite about violence and the darker side of humanity because that’s what I’mmost familiar with. I grew up with it and I chose that life when I came of ageand had a choice and could have gone the safe and secure route. It’s neverdull. And, I hate boring. Now, of course, I’m paying for it and I was prettysure at the time that some day I would. I didn’t work for a corporation or abureaucracy and so I have no pension. No savings, no money in savings, nopension. Nada. And, that’s fine. I had a really cool life and did more in justabout any given week than some of these folks have done in their entireexistences. And lived that kind of life year after year after year. I justnever wanted to be that guy whose biggest deal in life was the two or fouryears they spent in the service, or the same amount of time spent in college,or the one time they went to Europe and backpacked for the summer. That’s it?That’s sad. As far as I know, you only get to go around once, so why on earthwould an intelligent person spend most of their life doing boring-ass shit?Here’sa for-instance. There’ve been several times when I was homeless. I was homelessin Costa Mesa, one of the richest towns on earth, and I was sleeping on theconcrete floor of a garage and eating out of the dumpster of the Bob’s Big Boynext door for my meals. Was in pure agony from a severely pinched nerve towhere I had to be up three days in a row to be able to go to sleep for an hour.No health insurance or money for a doctor and that was fine. Was right on PCHand from the front door of the garage could look out at the QEII, anchoredthere. Never for one second did I feel sorry for myself. Why? I was living lifeand it was never boring, not for a second. I remember looking out at the QEIIand thinking about some rich dude out there, and feeling sorry for the guy. Iimagined he kind of at least suspected inside that probably the only reason thebabe on his arm was there was because of his bank account. I was living in thatgarage with a gorgeous redhead who had convinced me to come out to California fromwhere we’d been living in New Orleans, and I was pretty sure the guy on thatboat would have loved to have a girl like that on his arm, knowing she wasthere because of him and not because of the checks he could write. That kind ofshit is priceless and I’ve always been aware that it was, even in the worst oftimes. It’s those times that let you know you’re alive.I feel like I’ve lived theFrank Sinatra version of life. I did it my way. I was getting laid every nightby a girl who screwed me because she liked the way I screwed, not because Icould give her a charge card. How do you put a price on that? The guy at thecocktail party on the QEII was the unlucky one. I’m pretty sure your body feelspretty much the same way in jeans as it does in an Armani suit. It’s yourweak-assed mind that tells you it feels better, mostly because some dickheadyou don’t even like pretends to your face that you’ve accomplished something bywearing it. Your skin doesn’t know. Trust your skin.But, I owe a debt to bothBukowski and to Lefer. They showed me what was possible.Question: You're acreative writing teacher and you have written writing advice books. What's yourtake on the current writing advice market and how do you think young writersshould use such a tool?Thewriting advice market is bigger than it’s ever been and in many ways, better.In other ways, not better. Looking back to when I began writing many decadesago, there were very few such books available. Writers learned primarily from…reading novels and trying to figure out what worked and then adopting that fortheir own work. Today, there are so many books out there that the learningcurve can be tremendously shortened. Although, like anything, there’s adownside to the flood of advice. Like anything else, there’s a lot of good… andthere’s a lot of slag and dross.Thereare expectation problems among many writers. The expectation that there aregoing to be “secrets” revealed in these books that are somehow going tocatapult them onto the bestseller lists if they only unearth and use thesesecrets. I hate to be the one who tells folks that there really are no suchsecrets to becoming a good writer. All of the secrets in writing are rightthere in the open. They’re in the pages of novels you have open before you.When you see something that affects you emotionally in the novel you’rereading, stop and go back and figure out what that writer did that worked andhow he or she accomplished that.Often,writers read as… readers. Not as writers. They’re reading books on a verysuperficial level. For entertainment. That’s fine for nonwriters, but for awriter that’s foolish. To be blunt, it’s kind of stupid. It’s passing up thesingle best way to learn to write available.Ihad a student ask me one time that if he tried to analyze every novel as astudent and not just to be entertained, wouldn’t he lose the “magic” of thework? As it happened, this guy was a musician. Well, I said to him. Do youunderstand how to play an instrument? I won’t give his responses to thequestions that follow because his answer to each was “yes.” Do you know how toplay several instruments? Do you know how to write lyrics? Do you know how asymphony works—how all the parts go together to form a whole? Do you know howto create and build emotion within the listener with progressions? I asked abunch more questions in this vein and then I asked him: “Does your knowledgeaffect your enjoyment?” Sheepishly, he answered that it didn’t. It added to it,he said, because he knew better than most the skill and craft and art theperformer brought to the work. It only heightened his enjoyment.Anothertime, I had a college basketball player ask me what was basically the samequestion. Well, I said, do you understand how a man-to-man defense works? Doyou know how zone defenses work? Do you know the differences between aone-three-one and a two-three and a three-two? Well, sure he said. Of course.Do you know how a pick-and-roll works, I asked? Do you know that to be a goodshooter you aim for the back of the hoop and never the front? Again, heanswered in the affirmative. Then, I asked the clincher. Does that take awayfrom your enjoyment in watching a game? Do you think the guy sitting next toyou in the stands who knows nothing about the intricacies of the game enjoys itmore? I trust you can guess his answer.Thesame things could be asked of a chef. Because of a chef’s knowledge of spicesand foodstuffs and combinations of foods, does he enjoy eating a meal less?It’s a question that can be asked of any art form. The answer is always goingto be that the more the participant knows about the art and craft of anything,the higher the level of enjoyment is going to be, even though part of his focusis always going to be on how the art was created.Thissounds like a no-brainer and a waste of space to even point this out, but you’dbe surprised at how many would-be writers have this attitude. Personally, Iwish more of them had it. We’ve got enough competition as it is…Allof this is to say that there are too many writers who don’t do the workthemselves while reading and expect to pick up the latest and greatest craftbook as a kind of shortcut to find this stuff out. It can’t work like that andit doesn’t.Doesthat mean that craft books are useless? Not at all. The only thing I’d suggestis that they’re not relied on at the exclusion of the writer doing his own workto learn.Also,the writer needs to realize that craft books are these days often seen as cashcows by some publishers. There is more pressure than ever to convince abestselling author to write one. They bring an enormous audience with them andthat means, sales and money, boobie. Several of these aren’t delivering much inthe way of scholarship or new material, but are mostly regurgitating thingsmost writers already know or have already been promulgated in earlier books.The bestselling author often likes to write them as well, as it’s attractive inthat very often it has the effect of making them look smart and even somewhat“academic.” I imagine if Stephanie Meyer and James Patterson come out with acraft book, the publisher is going to be rubbing his hands together in glee atthe thought of all the large Christmas bonus checks he’s going to be able towrite out to his employees.Thoseare some of the negative things about craft books. The positives, however,mostly far outweigh the negatives. One very substantial benefit to a writer toread them is that very often seeing a particular bit of advice on the pagevalidates something his instincts have told him is something he should be doingbut he erroneously thought he shouldn’t. I had that very experience happen tome. Like most of us, I suffered through periods where I didn’t trust myinstincts in writing. I had read book after book, sat through workshop afterworkshop and lecture after lecture, where the advice had invariably been to“just get it down, lickety-split, and then go back and ‘fix it’ throughrewrites.” Apply that “work while the ‘muse descends’ white-hot fever ofcreation” and then go back and rewrite it. Well, my instincts always told menot to do that. What I wanted to do was make sure every sentence, everyparagraph was perfect before I went on. But, who was I? I was this littlenobody and all of these published, successful writers were continually tellingme that my instincts were wrong and that I should just write as fast as Icould. So I did what they said.And,then, one day I picked up a new craft book and this guy (wish to hell I couldremember who it was to give him proper and deserved credit!) was saying justthe opposite. I can still remember the day I read him. He said to not do whateverybody was always advising. He said to take your time, craft each sentenceperfectly before moving on. He said that when you marked things to berewritten, or underlined a word you furnished in haste and knew there was abetter word but you didn’t want to stop to figure it out, or knew you werehaving your character make a wrong turn, that you almost never were able toreturn to your frame of mind at that point and that instead of rewriting, youbecame a copy editor instead. He advised (this was in the typewriter days) toalways use your best, most expensive paper—that 20-bond stuff with thewatermark—and not the cheap stuff. He said when you came up with a word thatwasn’t quite right to stop right there and find the perfect word. That youshould never go onto the next page until the page you were writing was as goodas you could possibly make it. He said a whole bunch of other things alongthese lines, and at the end, he said that you’ll still probably have to do arewrite but he predicted you’d do far less rewrites than you had previously.And,he was right. Before I read this guy, I rewrote every novel an average of 8-10times. The instant I applied his advice, I went to an average of one rewriteper novel.Whathad happened was that I was like most writers. I was unsure of myself and of myinstincts. I needed someone in “authority” i.e., a bona fide writer, to tell methat what I wanted to do was okay. That my instincts were sound and to followthem. Bless this guy! He gave me “permission” to do something I had alwaysknown I should do, but was afraid to because it seemed to go against theoverwhelming “wisdom” of the writing fraternity.WhatI didn’t realize fully at the time that most of us who write do so becausefirst we were readers. Voracious readers. That means we’ve already assimilatedmost of the writing techniques we’ll ever need as writers, simply by dint ofour history—of reading thousands and thousands of books. That we already knowby all that reading what’s good and what isn’t and how to achieve good writing.That we have good “instincts” honed by years and years of reading. In fact, Ican tell very quickly the folks who join my writing class who’s going to makeit and who isn’t. The person who’s been reading nonstop and voraciously sincethe age of five or six has a decent chance of becoming a good writer. The onewho admits they’ve read very little most of their life, has very little, if anychance of success. We begin to learn to write at around that age. Not whenwe’re twenty. And, I know there are stories of people who’ve had success whofit that latter description. But, I’m talking about “good” writers, notnecessarily published writers or even bestselling writers. Good isn’t always descriptive of those authors…Anotherbenefit to reading craft books is related to the above. Very often, they serveto remind us of things we already knew and that’s valuable. Or, they show ussomething that we kind of knew or suspected was true but we hadn’t yetarticulated it to ourselves and the book made it clear the thing we wereperhaps fuzzy about.What’simportant about craft books is that even the very worst will almost have atleast one piece of solid information in it. If a person spends say fifteenbucks on a book and learns one tiny piece of useful information, that book haspaid for itself. So, I’d suggest to buy every single one of them. The ones thatare repetitive or don’t show us much of anything new are still worth thepurchase because if nothing else, they’ll probably serve to remind us ofsomething important we’ve forgotten.Theother thing is that writing changes. The public’s taste in novels changes. Thatmeans the writing advice has to also change to keep up. John Gardner, author of one of the most popular writing books in history, realized this(although some of the people promoting his books don’t), when just before hedied, he had lunch with his most famous pupil, Raymond Carver. At this lunch,he told Carver to “forget everything he’d taught him in college.” That“everything in writing had changed and that his advice then no longer applied.”And, he was exactly right. It’s too bad that there are tons of writing teachersin colleges world-wide that never saw this advice he gave Carver, becausethey’re still recommending his books to their students. That doesn’t meanthey’re useless—they’re still very valuable, but only in context to his era.That’s the part they don’t tell their students. Probably because they don’tknow or realize this. Much of what Gardner had to say is extremely valuable…and much of it isn’t. If he’d lived, he would have written other books onwriting that would have refuted at least some of what he said in his earlierbooks. But, he didn’t. He died and his words are frozen in amber while thewriting world has moved on in major ways.And,so as not to mislead—I heartily recommend Gardner’s books on writing. But, incontext. That means, read his, but read everything else in craft books,especially the current ones. Even the bad ones, but hopefully more of the goodones. The more you read, the more you’ll be able to sort out what works todayand what doesn’t. Bythe way, the single best piece of information on writing I’m aware of can befound by studying Richard Brautigan’s brilliant short story, “1/3, 1/3, 1/3.”If you read this and understand it, and more importantly, see yourself in thestory, there aren’t enough craft books in the world to help you master thecraft. You’ll see why Flannery O’Connorsaid in response to the interviewer whoasked her if writing programs discouraged writers: “Not enough of them.”Question: Last butnot least, mandatory manly question: who wins a fight to death between a Ninjaand a Viet-Cong?Ha-ha.I wouldn’t have a clue! I know nothing about ninjas at all, except they haveall these cartoons and chasey-fighty movies about them that some teenaged boysenjoy, and while I was in the Navy during the start of Viet Nam, I wasn’tstationed there, so know nothing about the Cong either. I suspect the Viet Congdude would prevail, however. I’ve known several people who wear those cutelittle black suits designed by airy “artistic” types down at the dojo and wholearn martial arts and never have worried about them too much—too often theyseem to have taken up these activities because they either have a Napololeoniccomplex or have a history of getting shoved around and think that learning thisstuff will make them bad, somehow. My knowledge of the Viet Cong is that theywere serious dudes who would cut you down in a New York second without eventhinking about it much. Plus, the few movies I’ve seen with ninja-likecharacters usually look like some choreographer who was a bit light in theloafers programmed their shit and when twenty of them attack a guy, they seemto favor doing so one by one, which always struck me as a curious way to fightand not a way I ever saw or was involved in down at the Dungeon in New Orleans.I think if they came up against a Viet Cong, he’d just kind of shake his headand mow them all down with his machine pistol. I do think that breaking boardsand bricks and things is kind of cute, though.Tobe honest, I don’t have much of an opinion of martial arts. I’ve known severalguys who were into that stuff—both on the bricks and in the joint—and nobodytakes them very seriously. I’m sure there are some who have an attitude and canback it up—I’ve just never met them, to my knowledge.Iremember a guy in high school whose dad was a state cop and who had him takeall of these classes. Guy ended up a black belt in something or other. The guywas a first-class bully. He pulled some of his Karate Kid pink flamingo moveson me in school one day and I hit him up alongside the head with a rock thesize of a baseball when we met up after school. I guess my black belt in rockstrumped his in Tai Kwon Whatever… I think a lot of those guys log in a lot ofmirror time, looking at themselves practicing their “moves” and imaginingthemselves down at the beach kicking the ass of the guy who kicked sand intheir faces in front of their little girlfriends.Ihave a story about this guy. One night during my senior year of high school, Iwas living in the little town of Lakeville, about fifteen miles south of SouthBend. One night I was up in South Bend partying and left for home about threeayem. When I hit the outskirts of town, I punched it and all the way home thespeedometer stayed at 120 mph. There weren’t any other cars on the road so I hadclear sailing. I’d just hit Lakeville and was making the turn on the far side,when a cop’s light went on behind me. I pulled over and up walks this statetrooper.Hetook me back to his car and started writing the ticket and talking to me. Hesaid, “I’ve been chasing you ever since South Bend and I had you at 120 all theway.” I said, “Well, that’s kind of good news. Tells me my speedometer’s right‘cause that’s what I had.” He handed me the ticket and I looked at the name andrecognized it right away. It was the Karate Kid’s father. I told him I knew hisson and we were great friends. We got to talking and he ended up tearing up theticket and writing me a warning. True story. That wouldn’t happen today, ofcourse. But, in those days and in that town everybody drove like that. And, wedidn’t have the point system yet nor DUIs or any of that stuff. In fact, inLakeville the Justice of the Peace was also the town barber and he’d let youpay your tickets off in installments. There wasn’t a single week out of theyear when I wasn’t paying off several tickets at once.Agood friend of mine, “Hairs” Miller and I had a contest that year to see whocould get the most tickets. Alas, I lost. I covered three walls of my bedroomwith tickets and Hairs covered his entire bedroom, plus half of the ceiling. Hehad a ’55 Chevy and nobody could catch him.Isaw the trooper down at our teen hangout a few weeks after he’d given me thewarning, and it turned out his son had told him that maybe we weren’t suchgreat friends after all and that I’d been the guy who’d thumped him. He came upto me and told me if he ever caught me again, it wouldn’t be good for me.Luckily, he never did.Theguy was kind of a joke to begin with. He’d sent a good friend of mine to thejoint a year or so before for life—the guy’d killed his mother and this guy wasthe cop who caught him—and my friend swore in court that if he ever got outhe’d look him up and kill him. He wasn’t the first who’d told this guysomething like that. There were a lot of guys in Pendleton and Michigan Citywho’d made the same threat and some of them were out. Anyway, this trooperended up wiring his house and driveway and yard so that if anyone pulled up ormoved in the yard, all the lights would come on in the house and outside andstart flashing. He’d throw something on and come running out with his shotgun.All the kids in school knew it, and when we were out drinking at night, therewere dozens of times we’d just whip into his driveway, watch the lights comeflashing on, and then beat it out of there. Funny stuff!Therewas a dude in Pendleton who, when he came into population thefirst day and out in the yard for recreation, started yapping about what a badass he was—had some kind of black or purple or rainbow-colored or whatever thebig color is in those belts and he’d be walking along and whip out one of those“Cute Lil’ Tweety Bird Crouching Tiger” thingys, and all I saw was guysgrinning and I gave him about a week before somebody turned him out. It was alot sooner than that… And, I’m pretty sure they didn’t surround him with twentyguys and go at him one-on-one… On the other hand, if a Viet Cong had showed upin the yard and people knew it, I don’t see the same reaction happening… That’sa guy who’d get some respect.Thething is, when a guy has to attend a school to learn how to fight, he’sprobably not going to be a dude you have to give much thought to. It’s kind oflike those guys who lift weights down at the gym. Gym muscles are cute, but I’dworry more about the fat slob or the anorexic dude who looks like a stiffbreeze might knock him over and who doesn’t say much, but who you know has anine under his arm and will use it. I suspect a lot of these guys spend a lotof time starring in the movies running through their heads… You can just tell…Anybody you'd like to thank, regardingthe release of THE RAPIST?Absolutely!Cort McMeel and Francois Camoin for believing in me and this book; Jon Bassofffor the same and for putting his own reputation and own money behind it, whichis always the truest test if someone believes in a book; a whole shitload ofwriters I respect for reading, blurbing and reviewing the book and giving ittheir blessings and high marks, and to Charles Bukowski and writers like himfor showing me the way. And, of course I’d like to thank my readers. Withoutreaders, writing is like having sex with yourself. The feedback you get foryour performance is ultimately flawed.Thankyou for a wonderful forum and opportunity, Benoit. Thank you for pushing me tobe honest and posing great questions.That’s it, folks. Check outBenoir Lelievre at his Dead End Follies  for greatinterviews, book reviews, and all kinds of things on writing.Hope you enjoyed this.Blue skies,Les"},

I’ve been mostly incommunicado from theInternet and had hundreds of emails waiting me when I returned and now have tocatch up on all of that, plus my online class, private writing clients, and abunch of stuff, but I’m re-energized and raring to go!My best friend, Tom Rough,the owner of the Taglio Salon,  and his gorgeous wife Lisa flew me outfor a birthday present and I had a wonderful visit with them and theirdelightful daughter Nicola who’s a freshman at ASU studying graphic arts. Didall kinds of amazing things. Tom took me to Scottsdale Stadium, the home of theSF Giants (the baseball team I’ve followed and been a huge fan of all my life) forthe Giants vs Reds game. They were sold out for the game, but Tom got us passesto the Charro Lodge (plush!) from his friend ThomBrennaman who announces for the Reds along with his father, Marty. One of thebest days of my life! I got to meet two Hall of Famers, Gaylord Perry andGeorge Foster and got to watch one of my favorite pitchers, MadBum (Bumgardner)pitch. A day I’ll never forget! Meeting Hall of Famer George Foster! Knocking back beers at Charro Lodge, Scottsdale Stadium, at the Giants-Reds game! Meeting one of my all-time heroes, HOF pitcher, Gaylord Perry!And, I got to spend sixhours with several of the writers in my online novel-writing group at Harold’sCorral and that was awesome! For the first time, I got to meet the brilliantwriters I’ve only known online (mostly) in person.  I just wish Icould have been there when our star class member, Maegan Beaumont launches herfirst book, CARVED IN DARKNESS, at the Poisoned Pen Bookstore in Phoenix on May 8. Maeganwrote this book and another one which is forthcoming, in class. The Phoenix/Los Angeles contingent of our online class. That's Kristen, Carson, moi, Susanna, Maegan and Linda. All brilliant writers and the best people ever! I get to sign one of my books and that's (L to R) Linda, Kristen, moi... and Susanna's arm... Still signing the same book (I'm slow...) and that's (L to R) part of Maegan's husband Joe's face, then Maegan and then me. At our table again (Linda reserved our own room for our meal). L to R, back row, is Kristen, me, and Susanna. In the front are Carson and Susanna's significant other, Jeremy.This was the week my newestnovel, THE RAPIST launched and I was basically incommunicado for most of it,but maybe I should stay away from social media more as it’s doing extremelywell—thank you, thank you, thank you all! Lots of interviews and reviews of itthat I’ll post in the next few days. I was supposed to fly backto Ft. Wayne on Monday, but the leg of my flight to Minnesota was delayedbecause of snow so I had to stay in Arizona an extra day (Yay! Go snow!) andgot in last night, exhausted. Getting to stay an extra day was a bonus, butwhat was even more of a bonus is that I got to meet Lisa’s boss, Chuck, theprincipal at the school she’s assistant principal at and hang out with Tom,Lisa and Chuck and slam down some beers and great conversation.I want to move to Arizona!Just wanted to update y’alland share my amazing birthday present vacation and show you some of the scenesand folks I got to see.Blue skies,LesMe, sitting by Tom and Lisa's pool on my \"extra\" day, trying to brown up my lily-white head... I still had jeans on as I just got back from the airport after learning I had to reschedule, but with 95 degrees, I soon changed into shorts. Just a wonderful, fantastic trip! At the Giants-Reds game at Scottsdale Stadium. What I came back to after Arizona...Lisa, Nicola and Tom. Notice THERE'S NO FRIGGIN' SNOW??!! That's what I'm sayin'..."},
{"title": "ARIZONA HERE I COME!", "date": "Wednesday, March 13, 2013", "text": "Hi folks,My excitement is building!Tomorrow morning I climb on a plane and go to Scottsdale, Arizona! My bestbuddy, Tom Rough, surprised me with a birthday gift a few weeks ago. He’sflying me to his home in Carefree, AZ and got us seats at the sold-out Giants-Reds game thisSaturday! I’ve been a Giants fan since I was a little kid when the firstbaseball game I ever got to see was in the Polo Grounds and was also WillieMays first game when he was called up from Minneapolis. One of Tom’s friends isThom Brennaman, the son of Marty Brennaman who announces Reds’ games and he gotus into the Charro Lodge Pavilion. Sweet! Tom tells me the MLB owners are having a meeting there during the gameand will be at the Charro. I’m kind of hoping one of the minority owners of theDodgers—Magic Johnson—will be there so I can chat with him about how the Giantsare going to kick the Dodgers’ butts this year. Maybe…And, on Friday, I’m meetingwith several of my students from my online novel writing class at Harold’sCorral inCave Creek near where Tom lives. I’m really, really excited about this! Thisgroup grew out of the classes I used to teach for Phoenix College who had hiredme after appearing at Microburst a few years ago to teach online for them. Iresigned from the college after a couple of years and began a private group anda lot of the Phoenix College students have stuck with me and it’s going to beso cool to get to meet with them up close and personal. And, uber-crime/noirwriter Keith Rawson says he’ll stop by and maybe even Eric Beetner who’ll be intown. It’s gonna get all Jack Daniels up in there!They tell me that Harold's Corral is the biggest Pittsburgh Steelers' bar in the Southwest. Now... where did I put my Carolina Panthers' jersey... My wife Mary is a bitworried about me going. In the past year, I’ve kind of gone a bit downhill,healthwise. Have pretty severe COPD, among other sundry ailments. Had to leaveBouchercon two days early this past fall, which totally sucked. This gettingold stuff is kind of crappy! But, I’ll be fine. Hell, Willie Mays is even olderthan I am and he’ll be there so I can pony up I figure. Although, I don’t knowif Willie smokes as much as I do…Tom is a special, specialfriend. Not because he’s flying me out there—but because I’ve been close friendswith him for more than 30 years. We met when I came back from some adventuresin New Orleans and then California and went back to work for awhile at Michael and Friends Hair Design Salon in South Bend. As it turned out, he claims Ikind of got up in his wheelhouse and convinced him to spread his wings andleave South Bend and aim higher. I helped him get a job in a toney Chicagosalon and he became the manager of the Vidal Sassoon Salon there and then wentto New York at Vidal’s request and became the manager there. In 1996, he andhis gorgeous wife Lisa moved to Scottsdale and opened the Taglio Salon which isconsidered the leading salon in the Southwest.BTW, Tom wouldn’t tell mewhat “Taglio” meant—he says it’s some Italian word, but I looked it up andfound out it’s a Chinese word used often in tattoos which means, literally, “thewon-ton is overcooked so serve it to the white-eye—he won’t know thedifference.” It amazes me how other languages can contain so much in a singleword!I cannot wait! I’m lookingout my window now at the new snow which fell last night. Dreaming about sittingout at Tom’s pool, sipping some Jack and toking on… enjoying conversationwith Tom, Lisa and their bright, funny, beautiful daughter Nicola. It’s gonnabe fun!Wish you all could join us!Blue skies,LesP.S. I'd like to thank everybody who bought a copy of THE RAPIST. I can't tell you how much that means to me. This is my retirement income so it goes far beyond meaning just a few sales  to me. I'm happy to report that it keeps on building in sales and is getting great reviews. So... thanks to each and everyone of you!Lisa, Tom and me kicking back at his home in The Boulders, Carefree, AZ when I was out there for Microburst a few years ago and Tom had me stay at their house."},

The Rapist paperback, U.S. editionThe Rapist ebook, U.S. editionThe Rapist paperback UKAs of this writing, the ebook version wasn't yet posted on the Amazon UK site yet, but it should appear at any time.Here are some of the prepub blurbs I was fortunate to garnerfor THE RAPIST. Thanks to everyone for your kind and gracious words.BLURBS FOR THE RAPIST1. Les Edgerton presents an utterly convincing anti-hero.The abnormal psychology is pitch-perfect. The Rapist ranks right upthere with Camus' The Stranger and Simenon's Dirty Snow. Aninstant modern classic.Allan Guthrie, author of Slammer and others. Publisher, Blasted Heath Books2. So, I’m reading Les Edgerton’s The Rapist. The title has already mademe uneasy.Five pages in and I can hardly breathe.Ten and I’m nauseous.For the next 50, I’m a mixture of all of theabove, but most of all, angry.I feel like ringing my feminist friends andconfessing: Sisters, I’m reading something you will kill me for reading.I feel like ringing my ex colleagues - paroleofficers and psychologists who work with sex offenders in Barlinnie Prison,Glasgow - and asking them if they think it’s helpful to publish an honest andexplicit transcript which shows the cognitive distortions of a callous,grandiose, articulate sex offender; one which illustrates his inability to havea relationship with a woman and his complete lack of empathy?I’m thinking I don’t know what I should bethinking.Will it turn sex offenders on?Should we listen to this guy?Is it possible to separate the person from theoffence, and to empathise with him as he waits to die?I don’t ring anyone. I read on.And the breathlessness, nausea, anger andconfusion increase all the way to the end, at which point all I know is thatthe book is genius.Helen FitzGerald,author, Dead Lovely, Bloody Women, TheDevil’s Staircase, The Donor and others.3. Take a Nabokovian narrator trying to convince the readerof his innocence and filter it through An Occurrence at Owl Creek Bridge andyou've got The Rapist, a raw and frightening journey through the inner psycheof a damaged man.Brian Lindenmuth,Publisher, Spinetingler Magazine and Snubnose Press4. One never knows what to expect when reading a novelentitled “The Rapist,” yet, similar to “The Bitch” which precedes this, withLes Edgerton you know you're in for an interesting ride. Tackling a toughsubject with great aplomb, Les Edgerton proves once again why he is one of themost exciting writers of this generation. The structure of this just astoundedme. I've never read anything like it before. I've never been so engrossed in anovel as I was with this one. I had no idea Edgerton had this literary part ofhis writing. I don't know of any other writers that can go from crime fictionto literary so seamlessly. Edgerton should be very proud of this novel...One of the bravest pieces of fiction you are likely to readthis year, and also one of the best. This is a novel you'll want to read againand again, an outstanding read!Luca Veste, author of thestory collections Liverpool 5, and More Liverpool Five. He is also theeditor of the story collection, Off theRecord5. The Rapist blends Camus and Jim Thompson in anexistential crime novel that is as dark and intoxicating as strong Irishcoffee. Les Edgerton pulls us into the corkscrew mind of Truman Ferris Pinter,a twisted man with skewed perception of the world, as his life spirals towardoblivion, like dirty dishwater down a plughole. It reminded me of JimThompson's Savage Night in itsdelirium.Paul D Brazill, Author, 13 Shots Of Noir and others.6. Les Edgerton’s book TheRapist is Albert Camus’ The Strangerretold as if by the lovechild of Edgar Allan Poe and Charles Bukowski. Yes,it’s disturbing, yet layered and provocative, with its combination of mysticismand perversion. I particularly like the cat and mouse relationship between theprotagonist Truman and the prison warden—it’s reminiscent of The Shawshank Redemption. This tale,with its many twists and turns, is definitely not for the faint of heart—butthen, the title should have made that clear.Scott Evans, Editor, Blue Moon Literary and Art Review,Author, First Folio7. William Faulkner on steroids orHannibal Lecter on meth; neither as literate or frightening as Les Edgerton inhis ground-breaking novel, The Rapist. This intellectual tour-de-force ripsopen the mind of a delusional psychopath taking the reader on a raw journeythat challenges Dante’s Inferno. And the last line of the book is thepenultimate example of a sociopath’s naked ego.Bob Stewart,author of Alias Thomas A Katt, HiddenEvil, No Remorse, Revenge Redeemedand others.8. A deathdream swan divefrom the existential stratosphere plummeting into the personal hell of atormented, broken psyche, The Rapistintroduces us to a gentle and philosophical misanthrope named Truman Pinter, atonce reminiscent of Albert Camus and Patricia Highsmith, even John Gardner’s Grendel and the journal of Carl Panzram.Les Edgerton melds introspection and visceral, human brutality in this deathrow narrative from a masterful storyteller, whose dissection of a psychopathwill haunt you long after the final page.Thomas Pluck,Well-known commentator on the noir scene, many short stories published inmagazines such as the Utne Reader, editorof the anthology, Lost ChildrenProtectors9. The Rapist is a disturbing look into thetwisted mind of a narcissistic psychopath on death row. A vulgar odysseyreminiscent of Nabokov’s Lolita, although far more depraved, Les Edgerton hascrafted a dark and brilliant story that leaves you as equally unsettled as itdoes in complete awe.Julia Madeleine,author of No One To Hear You Scream and The Truth About Scarlet Rose10. When Les Edgerton asked me to read an ARC of“The Rapist” he warned me with that title it may not be my thing and he wasokay with whatever I decided. I knew of his writing books like Hooked: Write Fiction That Grabs Readers at Page One& Never Lets Them Go and Finding Your Voice: How to Put Personality in YourWriting  but never had looked at any of his fiction. Iwas prepared for something graphic but he refused to talk about the plot orstoryline. No hints. I was ready to be offended. I’m a strong advocatefor women’s equality and won’t tolerate or put my name near anything thatbelittles woman. With a title of “The Rapist” it had two and a half strikesbefore I read the first line because rape is all about a man having power overa woman.From the first pages the words and voice made methink of American literature masters like Mark Twain and Edgar Allan Poe I wasforced to read in high school. The difference was in school I still mutteredabout reading dead masters and times, but grew to love the descriptions, plotsand characters that transported me to another moment in history. In “TheRapist” I read greedily to see where the book was going, totally engrossed inthe story. The honesty and freshness of the words from the main character keptme glued to the page to see what happened to the man caught in the worstcircumstances and an act of degradation to woman. That is about all I want tosay about the plot. I understand Les’s reasons for not explaining the details.You need fresh eyes to appreciate it but that isn’t to say I won’t go back andreread it like other writing masters savoring it. It is one of those books thateach time you read it, you find another kernel of truth, a pearl of wisdom. Ithas that many facets wrapped in rich layers of dialogue, characterization andsetting that pounded with each of the rapist’s heartbeat. I was hooked from thefirst page.Wendy Gager,author of A Case of Infatuation, A Caseof Accidental Intersection, and ACase of Hometown Blues.11. Les Edgerton’s masterly The Rapistis a deeply disturbing journey into the murky recesses of the mind ofpsychopathic death row inmate Truman Ferris Pinter. An intellectual, erudite,philosophical misanthrope, Truman draws the reader inexorably into hisfractured web. There are times when one nods one’s head in agreement with hiswell-reasoned arguments, only to shrink back in horror at the realisation.Sympathy for The Devil, indeed, in this dark vision of a black heart that isboth astoundingly honest and ultimately terrifying.Lesley AnnSharrock former publisher/editor MoondanceMedia (UK), author of 7th Magpie.12. Les Edgerton is the king of hard-edged, bad-ass crimefiction, and The Rapist is his most harrowing book yet.Scott Phillips, author of The Ice Harvest, The Walkaway, Cottonwood.13. Like Denis Johnson’sclassic novel-in-stories, Jesus’ Son, Les Edgerton’s The Rapistis a dark, risky, disturbing story that grabs the reader in a haunting fashionand holds on tightly. The writing is taut and unsettling. Edgerton is a mightytalent.TonyArdizzone, The Whale Chaser and others14. ‘I live in asmall, dark realm which I fill out’. Jean Genet’s words in “Miracle Of theRose”. And like Genet, Edgerton writes with lyricismand a sense of history of things that disturb, balancing through his superbstyle themes that may otherwise unsettle the narrative. Edgerton’sbrilliant archaeological dig into the motivations of a rapist is an unflinchinglook at the darker recesses of the human psyche. There is nothing gratuitoushere and it takes a command to achieve a narrative pull in such territory. Itreminded me of John Burnside’s “The Locust Room” but it’s better written. Edgerton voices the demonic forces at work within hisnarrator’s head. He embeds the story with the protagonist’s need for redemptionset against the backdrop of his life. \"The Rapist\" is confessional,poetic, unrelenting, and as real as the newspaper lying before you. Itchallenges the assumption that fictions need to censor the things people readevery day in what is deemed factual. It is told in a style that situates itamong the classics of transgressive fictions. Richard Godwin, Apostle Rising, Mr Glamour15. LesEdgerton's THE RAPIST is for those brave enough to acknowledge the ugly realityproduced by our illusions. It's unapologetic, tough, taut, and well-written.It's also stark and metaphysical. It poses hard questions and makes you lookhard for answers. This is great, challenging literature.Lee Thompson, author of When WeJoin Jesus in Hell16. Les Edgerton has written, in The Rapist, something that . . . that . . .well, defies explanation. Don't get me wrong; the writing is extremelypowerful. The imagery is wonderful and startlingly clear. The emotions arevivid and visceral. Emotions that grab you physically and rattle your teethviolently the further you dip into his tale. But the question is . . . how doyou define it?Nihilistic existentialism comes to mind as a basis for understanding. Therealization that nothing . . . nothing . . . is real or meaningful. Butsomehow the definition falls flat. There is, ultimately, a purpose for whathappens to the character. Better yet; there is a deep, almost Freudian, mysterythat grabs you and makes your imagination soar with the possibilities inunderstanding what is happening.I wouldn't say that, after youfinishing reading The Rapist,you're going to have a feeling of satisfaction. In fact I strongly suggestyou're going to feel as if you've just walked out of a House of Mirrors. Youcertainly will be confused, shocked, and puzzled.But you will realize thatyou've just read something amazingly original. Truly, magnificently, original.B.R. Stateham,author of A Taste of Old Revenge, ToughGuys: The Homicide Cases of Turner Hahn and Frank Morales, and others17. Meet Truman FerrisPinter, condemned prisoner #49028, a snarling, wicked, silver-tonguedmisanthrope – a black hole of a man who sucks you in with the human gravity ofhis self-deception, then distorts your beliefs with the super-logic of his epiphanies.Oh, it’s all there – gut-grabbing lust, sex, hate and violence, deeplydisturbing comments about our insane world – but The Rapist by LesEdgerton is much more than a new classic of Modern Noir. Against all odds,master wordsmith Edgerton has created the most mesmerizing and disturbingnarrator since Patricia Highsmith’s Tom Ripley, an intense, strange,well-spoken villain whose story and sexual perceptions will frighten many moremen than women. The Rapist is not who -- or what -- you think.Jack Getze, Fiction Editor,Spinetingler Magazine18. Logic and reasonmean everything to Truman Ferris Pinter. They trump all. Convicted of rape andmore, Pinter faces a sentence he isn't the least bit concerned about, becausehe has planned the perfect escape.In THE RAPIST,author Les Edgerton has penned potentially a career-defining work, challengingsocietal notions of right and wrong, crime and punishment, religion andphilosophy, and wrapping the whole thing up in a taut, breathtaking, utterlyabsorbing account of narcissism, self-absorption and unchecked ego. Edgerton is one ofthose rare writers who tackles the most difficult subjects unflinchingly, anddoes so in a way that leaves the reader spellbound. Whatever you think THERAPIST is about, you're wrong. Read it and see. You'll find yourself thinkingabout it long after you've finished.AllanLeverone, author of The Lonely Mile andothers.19. A unique, riveting look into the mind of a verydisturbed character. Tough to read, but tougher to put down. Only a writer withLes Edgerton's skill could pull this off.Terrence P. McCauley,Author of PROHIBITION and FIGHT CARD: AGAINST THE ROPES20. WhenI was given the opportunity to read Les Edgerton’s forthcoming novella, Ialready had in mind something of what I might experience. Having read JUST LIKETHAT and THE BITCH, I knew THE RAPIST would be uncompromising, and brilliantlywritten. And it is. Truth be told, however, the central character in THE RAPIST– Truman Pinter – is as far away from any protagonist Les Edgerton has everwritten. Indeed, apart from being uncompromising and brilliantly written, you’dbe hard pressed to guess this is a Les Edgerton book at all.For instance, here is the opening:Let me tell you who occupies this prison cell.Perfidious, his name is Perfidity. His name is: Liar, Blasphemer, Defiler ofTruth, Black-Tongued. He lies down with all members of the congregationequally, tells them each in turn they are his beloved, while he is alreadyattending to the next assignation, in his relentless rendezvous with theconsumption of souls.THE RAPIST is a book in three acts, beginning with Trumansitting in a prison cell, accused of rape, awaiting execution. Truman speakswith such precision and clarity, such perfect prose, the reader is immediatelyfaced with the conflict of how this weaver of words could commit such a brutalact. The seductive nature of the words is incredible. But that is only half thestory. The seduction is purely intellectual. It speaks purely to the mind.Truman seems a character almost totally bereft of any sort of empathy orcompassion. Never before have I read such coldness. Hannibal Lector doesn’teven come close. Truman Pinter is truly terrifying.Truman tells us of his crime, his justification for the act,his plan to thwart the authorities at the final moment. He is very difficult tolike.But then comes the second act. We learn of Truman’schildhood. We learn of how his pathology manifested. We learn of the boy heonce was. What is so brilliant about this is that as Truman tells us of hismother and his father, and of his childhood, he is barely aware how vulnerablehe is becoming. It is so very, very touching.The third act spins everything on its head, and concludeswith a twist that is sublime beyond words. A writer who writes a book THE RAPIST is a writer that holdsno fear. That is clear from the outset. It alerts the reader to the fact thiswill be a challenging read–and it is. A challenge for the reader to trust thewriter. Unreservedly. Trust the writer will keep them safe.  In Les Edgerton, you are in the safest of hands.THE RAPIST is bleak and touching, challenging andinspirational.An astounding read.Ian Ayris, author of Abide With Me and One Day in the Life of Jason Dean.21. I just finished The Rapist and . . . um . . . wow. . .just . . . I mean, holy . . . what a voice. What a . . .I mean, it's so . . .wow. Damn. Seriously.Eric Beetner, author of TheDevil Doesn't Want Me22. One page into Les Edgerton’s The Rapist and Iwhispered, “Damn.” Not just the kind of “damn” you utter in respect for theaudacity of what you’ve uncovered, but also that “damn” that means, “Why thehell didn’t I think of that?” You didn’t think of that because you haven’tlived it. The ring of ironbound authenticity is consistent throughoutEdgerton’s career, and The Rapist is no exception. Not just the bluntrealities of incarceration, of course, but the mileage on his narrators. Butthis is a different voice than we’re used to, a different kind of hunger.What’s new here is the abandon. This is the kind of work you get from a writerwith nothing left to lose, not one with nothing left to prove, and that’s thebiggest surprise of all.-David James Keaton, author of Fish BitesCop!23. Ezra. Finally.Years ago, the poet Ezra Pound, issued his one and onlycommandment to all the writers and poets who would follow in his footsteps:\"Make it new.\"  Since then many have tried. Most have failed. But LesEdgerton in, The Rapist, obeys that commandment to the letter.Truman Pinter, the protagonist of, The Rapist, by his veryname (an apt combination of Truman Capote and Harold Pinter; two giants ofmodern mysticism and hard reality) informs the reader that he or she is in fora strange and illuminating journey. The Rapist was very like being immersed suddenly in aboiling tsunami of religion, physics, philosophy, psychology, pathology; God,Freud, Kant, Jung, Skinner, Einstein, Hawking, John Milton, John Donne, Micky Spillane,Percy Bysshe Shelly and a choir of thousands all speaking at once in a cosmicargument; a grand parade of immortal thoughts, transcendent science and hard,hard reality. A wild surf that spins the reader head over heels, both lost andgrounded at the same time.If all that sounds confusing or frightening, don't bealarmed. Edgerton's steady hand at the tiller makes sure the reader is neverlost in this raging river of words, poetry and ideas. Les guides you home toport astounded, much wiser than you were -- and in complete awe of the ambitionand success of this sudden classic.Ezra Pound would be proud. And grateful that somebody hadthe vision -- and balls -- to finally follow his long ago command.A.J. Hayes, His stories and poems beenpublished in venues like Yellow Mama, Eaten Alive, A Twist Of Noir, ShotgunHoney, Black Heart Magazine’s Noir Issue. The Hard-Nosed Sleuth, Apollo’s Lyre,Flashshot, Skin Diver Magazine, Chris Rhatigan and Nigel Bird’s Anthology: PulpInk. He’s also in Off The Record and Off The Record 2,and is a well-known commentator on the noir literary scene.24.If the narrator of Camus’ The Outsiderhad written an especially disturbing thriller it would be The Rapist - rockhard, darkest Noir, very fine writing, first-class storytelling.An intelligent, proud psychopath on death row tries to winyour approval, in the last few hours before the big sleep. You don’t like himbut it’s impossible to stop reading.While some of us tourists can sometimes concoct realisticstories from knowing criminals and having dabbled occasionally, Mr Edgerton hasserved time, giving him knowledge citizens prefer not to have. Writers Helen Fitzgerald and Wendy Gager also had initialmisgivings being associated with this title and a persuasive narrator. My name,for the few who know it, is already associated with unapologetic hard drug use,chronic alcoholism, a lightweight’s criminal record, sex work, (that’s wheredrugs can take you) and twenty years campaigning for consensual fetish sex.“This is supposed to be about him!” sorry, but if degenerates like me aresquicked out by our unrepentant host, a cold man who looks down on those whoempathise with other humans, you might feel uneasy about this book. Decentpeople should despise scumbag predators but that’s not a reason to avoid thisgripping book.I’m thrilled to have a new author over whom to obsess. It’sbeen a while since I discovered Ted ‘Get Carter’ Lewis, Elmore Leonard andThomas Harris. Decades since I saw my first Tarantino. Les Edgerton belongs inthat company.Mark Ramsden, jazz musician and authorof Radical Desire (Mandrake) The Dark Magus and the Sacred Whore, TheDungeonmaster’s Apprentice, The Sacred Blood (Serpent’s Tail) War School (Troubador)25. A brilliantlynarrated tapestry of violence, sex, and death in American heartland, TheRapist is a must read for all noir aficionados and serious readers ofhard-boiled lit. Once again Les Edgerton proves that he is not only a master ofthe modern noir novel, but a literary stylist capable of delivering acontemporary classic.VincentZandri, bestselling author of The Remains and Murder by Moonlight26. Les Edgerton is the real deal, his work consistentlyunflinching and raw. And his new novel is no exception. Reminiscent of HubertSelby Jr.’s The Room, Edgerton’s The Rapist takes us deep into the mindof a disturbed man. And while some would label the character a monster,Edgerton is much more interested in finding whatever shred of humanity he canwithin the darkness. Ambitious and provocative, as every novel should be.Johnny Shaw, author of Dove Season and Big Maria.27. With THE RAPIST, Les Edgerton has written the mostbone-chilling, evocative, depraved and insightful novel of the year. Forget\"hardboiled\", forget \"noir\", forget everything you thinkyou know about what a genre story is supposed to be. THE RAPIST brushes all ofthat aside with a disdainful sneer and instead presents something that aspiresto far more than any single genre can provide. More than anything else, thisnovel occupies that same uneasy space that Dostoevsky's \"Notes fromUnderground\" rests in-- a controlled testament of misanthropy anddelusion. But whereas the great Russian's protagonist was fueled by rage,Edgerton's narrator is fueled by a sharp, ugly narcissism, and a beastlyinhuman nature that peeks like a stalker through his eloquent language andhigh-minded ideas. Not so much a plot-driven novel as a narrative, Edgertonguides us into the mind of his narrator and leaves us there alone to fend forourselves and make our own way back from the darkness. How much of what Trumansays can we dismiss as the ravings of a damaged mind? And how much must we stopand listen to, hunting for a glimmer of truth?THE RAPIST is a challenging novel, not for the squeamish,and definitely not for anyone who dislikes being pulled out of their comfortzone. It quite simply blew me away. Destined to be a classic.Heath Lowrance, The Bastard Hand, Dig Ten Graves, City ofHeretics and others.28. If you were familiar with Les Edgerton's work - youaren't anymore. The Rapist marks a whole new direction for the noirstalwart. He strips Kafka of genteel niceties and leads us on a searing voyageinto the black beating heart of an implacable sociopath. The Rapist willleave you jittery for days and wondering what damaged human depths there remainfor Edgerton to plumb.Court Merrigan, author of Moondog Over the Delta.29. Les Edgerton’s ‘The Rapist’is an extraordinary book. In essence, it describes theevents leading up to the protagonist’s incarceration and the time he passes ashe waits his final dawn to arrive. It’s written in a style ofyester-year and there are sketches that suggest a contemporary setting; what Ifeel the author achieves by this juxtaposition is to direct his thoughts to thehuman condition as it’s always been rather than it might be at any given point.The main character is anintellectual. A pedant. A philosopher. He is in the middle of a war ofattrition against the people he meets, himself and even more importantly withthe reader. It’s like being hit repeatedlyby a blunt object as he cajoles and insists and backs up his arguments. Thereare even times when the guy seems convincing and these are the most disturbingsections of all. There aren’t many modern bookslike this, I’m pretty sure. Though it may not always be a fun ride, there’s anelement of satisfaction for the reader who takes this on in undertaking such aperilous journey. I left ‘The Rapist’ battered, bruised and exhausted- what more can one say about a book than that?Nigel Bird,author of Smoke, Mr Suit, In LocoParentis30. Les Edgerton's The Rapist reads like congress with the Devilhimself - elegantly unsettling and with a hell of an after-taste.Jedidiah Ayres, author of Fierce Bitches31. TheRapist's narrator has the same overweening self-importance as Nabokov's HumbertHumbert and the Lolita comparisons don't end there. At times you don't want tolook, you want to wash your mind out but this compelling work, told in bleaklysonorous prose, pulls you back. Les Edgerton has produced that rare thing: abook of seriousness.Tony Black,author of Murder MileThank you so much, everyone!Hope you enjoy the read! Blue skies,Les"},
{"title": "Two New Reviews!", "date": "Wednesday, March 6, 2013", "text": "Hi folks,I wanted to share my take on two books I've read recently that are just smashmouth great!First up is Jed Ayres' story collection, titled (ready?) F*ckload of Shorts. Jed Ayres is just the coolest dude! He's a well-known name in the world of noir literature and hosts the Noir @ The Bar event in St. Louis, which is legendary. He also writes a column on noir and crime writing for Barnes&Noble.  I got one of his rare invitations to participate and my wife Mary and I drove down and had one of the best times I've ever had. He's a terrific host, a wonderful person, and a brilliant writer and I hope I get to take part in a future Noir@Bar event in the future.I've been waiting for this collection to come out for thelongest time and the wait was worth it. An amazing, mesmerizing collection ofdarkness and human truth. Every single story here is brilliant, but I found aspecial connection to \"The Whole Buffalo.\" A movie that rests withinmy top ten list is the black comedy EATING RAOUL (when I teach writing at theuniversity level, I always show it for how to create black comedy), and Ayre'sshort story took the premise of that movie and rode it to a new level entirely.Now, I want an entire novel centered around this character.Buy this book! Another book that blew my doors off was Tom Pitts PIGGYBACK. Reading this guy was like sitting in a cell in Pendleton, listening to my cellie tell a story. I was tempted at first tosay something to the effect that Tom Pitt’s novel PIGGYBACK was “the best ofnoir,” but that would have been almost akin to damning it with faint praise.Like Nabokov, I don’t believe in genres. Like him, I think the only genres are “goodwriting” and “bad writing.” Well, PIGGYBACK belongs in that first group and I’dgo beyond “good” to declare it “superlative” writing. I’m ranking it among mypersonal list of one of the best books I’ve read, period.There are a lot of writerspenning novels that are crime-based and centered around criminals. While manyof them are entertaining and I enjoy reading them, this novel goes beyond mereentertainment and is a book that contains that rare verisimilitude that onlythose who’ve walked the walk can achieve. As a criminal of many years myself, Irecognize those few writers who’ve actually lived on the dark side and Mr. Pittsis indeed, just such a writer and you can tell.I’ve known his charactersintimately. Up close and personal. And, I am positive that he does as well. Itshows in the way he treats his characters and the choices he has them make. Youcan’t fake veracity, although there are lots who try. They can fool thestraights but they can’t fool the ex-con. Jimmy is my ex-cellmate. He’s my oldrappy. He thinks and he acts exactly like the way criminals act. His rappiePaul is a guy I’ve known many times in my own life as well. These characters—allof them—are as true as any characters ever have been. They’re real, man, andthey’re not Hollywood in any sense.PIGGYBACK will show you thetrue nature of the criminal. And, in doing so, it transcends genres. This isliterature and of the highest order.Keep your eye on these two guys. They're destined to become novas in the literary universe.Blue skies,Les"},

The author is a friend I've known for a long time, but this was the first time I'd read any of her work. I know her as Robin Billings and she's chosen to use an old family name (Martin) for this book. Robin has done a ton of great things to help my own career--she introduced me to the great Paul D. Brazill for one very big thing!--and I'm just happy that I can hopefully return the favor a bit by recommending her book here. Below is the review I posted in Amazon and Goodreads. It's one of those books that I know will become part of me and a book that will forever help inform how I see women from now on.Like they say by the watercooler--You've got to read this! You really do.THE HIDING PLACE GIRL by Robin MartinI’ve just turned the lastpage on a wondrous book, titled TheHiding Place Girl by Robin Martin. I’m just now getting my breath back. I’veonly experienced the feeling I got from Robin’s book a couple of other times.One was when I finished Dr. Richard Selzer’s Letters to a Young Doctor. I was in one of my MFA residencies whenI read Dr. Selzer’s book and the next morning, I was privileged to eatbreakfast with him. Later that day, he gave a talk to the student body andfaculty and afterward, I was walking on the grounds in an absolute daze afterthe experience and a fellow classmate came running up to me, telling me he’dgotten stuck in town and hadn’t been able to make it.“How was his talk?” he said.I thought for a longmoment. I didn’t have the words to describe the experience. Finally (andweakly), I came up with my answer. “It was like being in a cathedral andhearing the voice of God,” I said. And it was. Dr. Selzer had deeply touchedevery good emotion a human being is capable of feeling.I felt the same way uponfinishing Martin’s novel. I have never understood women as well as I do now afterreading her work and have never loved women as much. What a marvelous creationthey are! What wondrous brains and hearts and souls they have!Thank you, Robin. This isevery bit as good as Dr. Selzer’s book and it’s every bit the revelation of theopen, totally honest heart of a human being as anything Walt Whitman everrevealed. This is true and it is intelligent and it is the kind of thing Ithink of when I think of poetry and literature.I am in awe and I thankyou.Hope you get a copy! You'll thank me.Blue skies,Les"},
{"title": "Canadian crime writer Rob Brunet reviews THE BITCH", "date": "Monday, February 25, 2013", "text": "Hi folks,  Canadian crimewriter, Rob Brunet just posted his review of my book THE BITCH (winner of the Preditors & Editors Award for Best Thriller and nominee for the Spinetinger Magazine Award for Best Novel (Legends Category) on his blog.   THE BITCH in Les Edgerton’s novel is not who orwhat you might expect from the title, but it’s a serious bitch nonetheless. Ithounds Jake, Edgerton’s matter-of-fact narrator, from chapter one to the verylast page. And along the way, Edgerton makes sure we get to know the bitch realwell.For the mostpart, the story takes place outside of prison, on the bricks, but the jointcasts its shadow large from the moment Jake’s former cellmate calls him out ofthe blue. Walker Joy is a cruel oxymoronic name for a guy who brings a shitstorm into Jake’s life—a good life he’ll do anything to protect.In ajocular passionate voice, Jake leads the reader step by rational step into darkcorners completely foreign to your average \"civilian\". The horrificdecisions Jake has to make would be much less believable if it weren't forEdgerton's masterful hand. Given what’s at stake, there’s hardly a moment whena you can argue with the path Jake takes—even as the grotesque results piledeeper by the page.This isthe kind of book you're going to reach for at 3:30 in the morning becausewhatever crap is disturbing your sleep won't stand a chance against the terrorlooming in the next chapter.THE BITCHdoesn't rely on bad luck or cheap device to create drama. Nothing pops out ofthe closet when it oughn't. Jake plays the cards he's dealt. It's a lousy handand he does all he can to make it better. He's got optimism, criminal skill,and solid execution. He even gets a couple good breaks. But the deeper he goes,the more the bitch laughs in his face.And whereTHE BITCH takes him ain't funny at all. Even if it makes tragic good sense.Thanks, Rob!

{"title": "Review of THE RAPIST by The Fright Site", "date": "Monday, February 18, 2013", "text": "Hi folks,(Warning: Some of the language and content below may not be suitable for younger readers.) Here's one of the first pre-pub reviews of my forthcoming (March 20, 2013) novel, THE RAPIST, from The Fright Site an online site dedicated to horror entertainment, with frightening fiction, scary movies, gruesome games, bizarre comics, stimulating movie reviews, commentary on the horror genre, and weird diversions. The Fright Site's movies and internet fiction have won numerous awards. Online since 1995, The Fright Site is one of the oldest horror sites on the web.The review of THE RAPIST was written by Adam Groves.THE RAPISTBy LES EDGERTON (New Pulp Press; 2013)Here we have a genuine rarity: a truly original entry ina rather hackneyed subgenre. THE RAPIST is so unique, in fact, that I’mfinding it difficult to adequately describe. It’s a bit like THEKILLER INSIDE ME crossed with THE STAR ROVER, being a stark crimeprocedural, a gritty account of prison life (the author, unsurprisingly, is anex-con) and a near-psychedelic depiction of the whorls of a deranged mind, allcontained in an economic 142 pages.      The first person protagonist isone Truman Ferris Pinter, a rapist-murderer reflecting back on his life andcrimes from his death row cell. In contrast to the protagonists of most crimenovels, Truman is extremely well educated, a Harvard bred snob whose nature isreflected in his often absurdly erudite prose (example: “I had moreprofitably recalled a sonnet of Andrew Marvell or a scene from Aeschylus, bothexamples far loftier than grubby, nefarious depravations of someinconsequential peasants…”).      That Truman is an unreliablenarrator is evident early on when he provides two separate accounts of thebrutal rape and murder of a young woman that led to his incarceration. He’strying desperately to convince us (and himself) of his innocence, first byclaiming his crime wasn’t “actually” a rape and the woman’s death an accident,and then by questioning the very concept of rape, arguing that rape isinstrumental in propagating the species and that other cultures have moreaggression-friendly views of sexuality than ours.     Some blunt descriptions ofprison life follow, with Truman admitting to being raped by another inmate (“Ifelt nothing during it other than wishing he’d speed it up”) and breaking atooth on a piece of gravel mixed in with his food. Truman also engages in a lotof freeform musing about the events of his life, during which he reveals a mostintriguing tidbit: that as a child he could fly. Truman claims to have regainedthat ability, and proves it (in a manner of speaking) when his mind eventuallyunmoors itself entirely from the here-and-now and enters a subconscious realmwhere Truman time-trips, speaks with God and witnesses his own death beforeundergoing a painful self-realization.     Eccentric pulp fiction oravant-garde literature? I’ll leave it up to you to make that distinction foryourself. It won’t take you more than a couple sittings to read this short,shocking and profound novel, but I can guarantee you will be indeliblyimpacted by the experience.　More to come...Blue skies,LesP.S.

{"title": "FINDING YOUR VOICE", "date": "Tuesday, February 12, 2013", "text": "Hifolks,Yearsago, I published my first writer’s craft book, FINDING YOUR VOICE with Writer’sDigest Books. It enjoyed wonderful success and last year sold out all of theprint copies. My agent, Chip Macgregor was able to secure the ebook rights to itand with his help I was able to put out an ebook version of it. We changed thecover and everything else remained the same. And, it’s still selling likecrazy!Inthe last few days, Chip has graciously posted a couple of excerpts from it onhis blog and he got a lot of great comments on the posts. You can access themhere. This link will take you to the most recent post and if you just scroll down,you’ll find the two posts on Finding Your Voice.Ithought it might be helpful today to include an exercise I used to give when Iwas the visiting writer-in-residence at the University of Toledo. I stole itfrom my buddy, Jane Bradley. (Keep in mind what they say: Good writers borrow—greatwriters steal…)Theimpetus behind it is knowing that every single person and living thing sees thesame exact scene in a different way. Take a single city block. Say, aresidential street in a lower-class neighborhood. Take two differentindividuals, one a welfare worker and the second an aluminum siding salesman.Thewelfare worker might notice the tricycle standing upended and with a missingwheel  in the front yard that needs mowing and weed removal, along withthe sack of empty beer bottles at the curb awaiting pickup, and think, “I needto check with the people in this house to see if there’s any child abuse goingon.”Thesiding salesman might not even see or register the trike or the empties at thecurb, but might see the peeling paint of the house next to it and think, “Damn!Here’s a guy who could use some new siding.” The things the welfare worker sawmight be invisible to him. He sees them perhaps, but he doesn’t see them.Theseare just two small examples of how different people look at the same exactscene but each registers very different things.It’sthis condition we all operate under that you can use to inform the charactersin the novel you’re writing. Let’s say you have a burglar in your story and youhave him walk down that same street. He might not notice the trike in front ofthe one house nor the peeling paint job of its neighbor, but he might indeednotice the widescreen TV he sees through the front window of the second houseand notice that the door is slightly ajar and the wood appears to be a bitrotted. Easy access… Neither the welfare worker or the siding salesman noticedwhat your burglar focused on. We all practice selective vision depending on whowe are, what our jobs are, and on a myriad of other factors.And,this is how you get into your character’s frame of mind. If you’re writing astory and have a character who’s say a game warden, then climb in your car andtake a drive in the country. Get yourself inside what you perceive is a gamewarden’s mind and try to notice the kinds of things such a person would notice.Really look for the things a game warden might notice that you yourselfprobably wouldn’t. Let’s say you drive by a woods and notice a pickup truckparked in the open field next to it. If you were driving down that same road inyour normal frame of mind as a novelist or a housewife or a Laundromat owner orwhatever and whoever you are in “real life,” you might notice there’s a truckthere, but it would most likely be a blip in your minds’-eye and quickly begone without much or even any thought to it. But… in your game warden frame ofmind, you notice that it’s July and as far as you know there’s no huntingseason going on and you wonder if maybe that truck belongs to a deer poacher.Nowyou’re thinking like your character! This is the time to return home and beginwriting the scene from the game warden’s pov. You’ve just became that gamewarden yourself and will write with the kind of verisimilitude a real gamewarden might bring to the typewriter or computer.Seehow this works?Here’sthe exercise I gave my students: I prepared a list of all kinds of charactersand made little slips of paper with each character on it. A typical list mightbe: a nun, an armed robber, an astronaut, a six-year-old girl, a Germanshepherd, a person from Ghana on their first day in the U.S., an Amish teenagedgirl who’d never been away from her farm before today, a sparrow, an alcoholicwith no money and no booze, a pimp and so on. You can put virtually anythingand any kind of character you wish on the list. I then ask the students to drawout one of the slips and not tell any of their classmates what they drew. They’rethen asked to go out into the campus and note what they see but through the eyes of that character. Whenthey’re done, they’re to return to class and take ten minutes to write a briefscene through that persona. Nowhere in it are they to reveal who or what theyare, other than through the artifacts they describe seeing.Whenthey’re done, each student stands up and reads his or her scene. Then, the restof the class tries to guess who or what they are. It’s a very rare occasionwhen the class doesn’t guess almost instantly who they are, even if their characteris really esoteric, like the Amish girl or the German shepherd. This isabsolutely one of the best exercises I’ve ever come upon for showing writershow to get inside their fictional characters hearts and minds. It’s alsoextremely instructive in illustrating how the same scene is seen verydifferently by the various characters. Most just go out into the quad thecampus buildings are around so most are using the same exact scene. But, ifthere are twenty people in class, we’re treated to twenty very differentdescriptions of the same exact scene. I’m not big on most writing exercises,but this is one that really works. Try it for your own novel or short story ifyou’re writing a character that isn’t you. You’ll be amazed at how much moreaccurate your depiction becomes once you’ve walked around your neighborhood ortaken a drive in your town looking at ordinary vistas you look at every day butthrough the eyes of your particular character.Plus,it’s just plain fun to do! I guarantee you no one misses that class when theyknow it’s coming up. They’ve heard too much about it from kids who took theclass previously.Thisexercise and other info on how to write in your own particular and unique voiceare within the pages of FINDING YOUR VOICE. Hope you glom onto a copy and morethan that, I hope you find it valuable in your own writing.Blueskies,LesMy agent, Chip Macgregor in a photo showing all the power of Photoshop and how it can remove literally dozens and dozens of imperfections..."},
{"title": "Review of Bob' Stewart's thriller, FIRST BORN", "date": "Friday, February 8, 2013", "text": "Hi folks,Today, it's my genuine pleasure to talk about my good friend Bob Stewart's newest thriller, recently released, titled FIRST BORN. Below is the review I posted in Amazon and Goodreads.   Five stars *****BobStewart made a national name for himself with his bestselling true crime bookssuch as NO REMORSE. He’s doing the same thing these days with his thrillers.Stewartdelivers one of the most chilling murderers in contemporary fiction with theintroduction in FIRST BORN of Percy Kilbourne, known to most as “No Mercy Percy” Kilbourne, whomisspells his own last name as “Kill Born” to reflect what he sees and owns ashis evil destiny. What Stewart has done here is nothing short of remarkable. Hehas turned the plot of Pygmalion upside down and created a character who beganas the white-trash rapist in Deliveranceand is transformed during his stint in prison into a smooth, cultured,educated, sophisticated guy who can charm preachers and old ladies out of theirsocks, while creating a personal apocalypse for those he has vowed vengeance against.Sent to prison by a jury bent on ridding society of a murderer, even whenpresented evidence that legally he should be set free, No Mercy Percy gets setfree by the same lawyer who served as jury foreman for his conviction… and setsout to destroy the lives of all who sat in judgment on him.Over andover again, while reading this novel, I kept thinking of Robert DeNiro’sportrayal of Max Cady in the remake of CapeFear. I’ve always thought of that performance as the best depiction of thesingle scariest villain in any movie or book—much more frightening even thanHannibal Lector. Well, Stewart’s No Mercy Percy is the guy who could take downMax Cady. He’d have him for breakfast. To steal a line from one of my own storiesthat seems apt: Wherever this guy was became the bad part of town.This isone scary guy. You’ve got to read this book. And then, send letters to DeNiro’sagent. This is a role that was made for him.That's the review. And you can take this to the bank--this is indeed, one scary dude!I'm kind of worried now. Later this summer, Bob is picking me up along with our mutual friend, Carl Brush, and we're driving on to the Writer's Retreat Workshop in Minnesota where I'll be presenting and they'll be... drinking? Now I wonder if I should be in a car with a guy who can dream up people like No Mercy Percy... I'm pretty sure I won't be dozing off...Get his book. It's a winner.Blue skies,Les"},

You don’t like him but it’s impossible to stop reading.While some of us tourists cansometimes concoct realistic stories from knowing criminals and having dabbledoccasionally, Mr Edgerton has served time, giving him knowledge citizens prefernot to have. Writers Helen Fitzgerald andWendy Gager also had initial misgivings being associated with this title and apersuasive narrator. My name, for the few who know it, is already associatedwith unapologetic hard drug use, chronic alcoholism, a lightweight’s criminalrecord, sex work, (that’s where drugs can take you) and twenty yearscampaigning for consensual fetish sex. “This is supposed to be about him!”sorry, but if degenerates like me are squicked out by our unrepentant host, acold man who looks down on those who empathise with other humans, you mightfeel uneasy about this book. Decent people should despise scumbag predators butthat’s not a reason to avoid this gripping book.I’m thrilled to have a newauthor over whom to obsess. It’s been a while since I discovered Ted ‘GetCarter’ Lewis, Elmore Leonard and Thomas Harris. Decades since I saw my firstTarantino. Les Edgerton belongs in that company.Mark Ramsden, jazz musician and author of Radical Desire (Mandrake) TheDark Magus and the Sacred Whore, The Dungeonmaster’s Apprentice, The SacredBlood (Serpent’s Tail) War School(Troubador) And here’s one from anotherBrit, the uber-talented Nigel Bird:Les Edgerton’s ‘The Rapist’ is an extraordinarybook. In essence, it describes the events leading upto the protagonist’s incarceration and the time he passes as he waits his finaldawn to arrive. It’s written in a style of yesteryear and thereare sketches that suggest a contemporary setting; what I feel the authorachieves by this juxtaposition is to direct his thoughts to the human conditionas it’s always been rather than it might be at any given point. The main character is an intellectual. Apedant. A philosopher. He is in the middle of a war of attrition against thepeople he meets, himself and even more importantly with the reader. It’s like being hit repeatedly by a bluntobject as he cajoles and insists and backs up his arguments. There are eventimes when the guy seems convincing and these are the most disturbing sectionsof all. There aren’t many modern books like this, I’mpretty sure. Though it may not always be a fun ride, there’s an element ofsatisfaction for the reader who takes this on in undertaking such a perilousjourney. I left ‘The Rapist’ battered, bruised and exhausted - what more canone say about a book than that?NigelBird, author of Smoke, Mr Suit, In LocoParentis Thanks, guys!Now—here’s some more of quotes from writers about all kinds ofsubjects.On fame:“Fame is a vapor, popularity an accident; the only earthlycertainty is oblivion.” Mark Twain“Firstyou’re unknown, then you write one book and you move up to obscurity.” MartinMyers“Awriter is always admired most, not by those who have read him, but by those whohave merely heard about him.” H.L. Mencken“Whenaudiences come to see us authors lecture, it is largely in the hope that we’llbe funnier to look at than to read.” Sinclair Lewis“Ittook me fifteen years to discover I had no talent for writing, but I couldn’tgive it up because by that time I was too famous.” Robert Benchley“Lolita is famous, not I. I am anobscure, double obscure, novelist with an unpronounceable name.” VladimirNabokov“Oddthings happen to book writers when they become famous.” Ronald Sukenick“Littlepresses write to me for manuscripts and when I write back that I haven’t any,they write to ask if they can print the letter saying I haven’t any.” JohnSteinbeck“It’sa short walk from the hallelujah to the hoot.” Vladimir NabokovOngrammar:“Grammaris the grave of letters.” Elbert Hubbard“Anyfool can make a rule and every fool will mind it.” Henry David Thoreau“Idon’t know any but the simplest rules of English grammar, and I seldomconsciously apply them. Nevertheless, I instinctively write correctly and, Ilike to think, in an interesting fashion. I know when something sounds rightand when it doesn’t, and I can tell the difference without hesitation, evenwhen writing at breakneck speed. How do I know this? I haven’t the faintestidea.” Isaac Asimov“Usageis the only test. I prefer a phrase that is easy and unaffected to a phrasethat is grammatical.” W. Somerset Maugham“Whycare for grammar as long as we are good?” Artemus Ward“Youcan be a little ungrammatical if you come from the right part of the country.”Robert Frost“Grammaris a piano I play by ear. All I know about grammar is its power.” Joan Didion“Wordhas somehow got around that the split infinitive is always wrong. That is apiece with the outworn notion that it is always wrong to strike a lady.” JamesThurberThesefolks ain’t lyin’…Hopeyou enjoyed ‘em!Blueskies,LesMy agent Chip Macgregor and me hanging out.

And, following these, some morewriter’s quotes for your perusal… Building the buzz... (click on the links to see their own way-good books)Fromthe fantastic British writer, Tony BlackThe Rapist's narrator has the same overweeningself-importance as Nabokov's Humbert Humbert and the Lolita comparisons don'tend there. At times you don't want to look, you want to wash your mind out butthis compelling work, told in bleakly sonorous prose, pulls you back. LesEdgerton has produced that rare thing: a book of seriousness.Tony Black, author of Murder MileAndone from another fantastic writer, Heath LowranceWithTHE RAPIST, Les Edgerton has written the most bone-chilling, evocative,depraved and insightful novel of the year. Forget \"hardboiled\", forget\"noir\", forget everything you think you know about what a genre storyis supposed to be. THE RAPIST brushes all of that aside with a disdainful sneerand instead presents something that aspires to far more than any single genrecan provide. More than anything else, this novel occupies that same uneasyspace that Dostoevsky's \"Notes from Underground\" rests in-- acontrolled testament of misanthropy and delusion. But whereas the greatRussian's protagonist was fueled by rage, Edgerton's narrator is fueled by asharp, ugly narcissism, and a beastly inhuman nature that peeks like a stalkerthrough his eloquent language and high-minded ideas. Not so much a plot-drivennovel as a narrative, Edgerton guides us into the mind of his narrator andleaves us there alone to fend for ourselves and make our own way back from thedarkness. How much of what Truman says can we dismiss as the ravings of adamaged mind? And how much must we stop and listen to, hunting for a glimmer oftruth?THERAPIST is a challenging novel, not for the squeamish, and definitely not foranyone who dislikes being pulled out of their comfort zone.

Boorstin“Cananybody be so naïve as to think he or she can learn anything about the pastfrom those buxom bestsellers that are hawked around by book clubs under theheading of historical novels?” Vladimir Nabokov “Thewriting of a bestseller represents only a fraction of the total effort requiredto create one.” Ted Nicholas“Ifwe should ever inaugurate a hall of fame, it would be reserved exclusively andhopefully for authors who, having written four bestsellers, still refrained from starting out on alecture tour.” E.B.

{"title": "More blurbs for THE RAPIST and more snazzy writer's quotes", "date": "Sunday, February 3, 2013", "text": "Hi folks,Got a couple more blurbs for THERAPIST to share with you and get this buzz thingy going. And, following theseare more writer’s quotes.Here’s the first, from bestsellingmystery author, W.S. Gager.When Les Edgerton asked me toread an ARC of “The Rapist” he warned me with that title it may not be my thingand he was okay with whatever I decided. I knew of his writing books like Hooked: Write Fiction That Grabs Readers at Page One& Never Lets Them Go and Finding Your Voice: How to Put Personality in YourWriting  but never had looked at any of his fiction. Iwas prepared for something graphic but he refused to talk about the plot orstoryline. No hints. I was ready to be offended. I’m astrong advocate for women’s equality and won’t tolerate or put my name near anythingthat belittles woman. With a title of “The Rapist” it had two and a halfstrikes before I read the first line because rape is all about a man havingpower over a woman.From the first pages the wordsand voice made me think of American literature masters like Mark Twain andEdgar Allan Poe I was forced to read in high school. The difference was inschool I still muttered about reading dead masters and times, but grew to lovethe descriptions, plots and characters that transported me to another moment inhistory. In “The Rapist” I read greedily to see where the book was going,totally engrossed in the story. The honesty and freshness of the words from themain character kept me glued to the page to see what happened to the man caughtin the worst circumstances and an act of degradation to woman. That is aboutall I want to say about the plot. I understand Les’s reasons for not explainingthe details. You need fresh eyes to appreciate it but that isn’t to say I won’tgo back and reread it like other writing masters savoring it. It is one ofthose books that each time you read it, you find another kernel of truth, apearl of wisdom. It has that many facets wrapped in rich layers of dialogue,characterization and setting that pounded with each of the rapist’s heartbeat.I was hooked from the first page.WendyGager, author of A Case of Infatuation, ACase of Accidental Intersection, andA Case of Hometown Blues.Andone from Richard Godwin, who, incidentally gave me the single most exhaustingandthought-provokinginterview I’ve ever been through…‘I live in a small, dark realm which I fill out’.Jean Genet’s words in “Miracle Of the Rose”. And like Genet, Edgertonwrites with lyricism and a sense of history of things that disturb, balancingthrough his superb style themes that may otherwise unsettle the narrative. Edgerton’s brilliant archaeological dig into the motivationsof a rapist is an unflinching look at the darker recesses of the human psyche.There is nothing gratuitous here and it takes a command to achieve a narrativepull in such territory. It reminded me of John Burnside’s “The Locust Room” butit’s better written. Edgerton voices the demonic forcesat work within his narrator’s head. He embeds the story with the protagonist’sneed for redemption set against the backdrop of his life. \"TheRapist\" is confessional, poetic, unrelenting, and as real as the newspaperlying before you. It challenges the assumption that fictions need to censor thethings people read every day in what is deemed factual. It is told in a stylethat situates it among the classics of transgressive fictions. Richard Godwin, Apostle Rising, Mr GlamourAnd now some writer’s quotes:First, writers on Hollywood. All of these are fromWriters On Writing, compiled by Jon Winokur.“I went out there for a thousand a week, and Iworked Monday and I got fired Wednesday. The guy that hired me was out of townTuesday.” Nelson Algren“A dreary industrial town controlled by hoodlums ofenormous wealth, the ethical sense of a pack of jackals, and taste so degradedthat it befouled everything it touched.” S.J. Perlman“I’m a Hollywood writer, so I put on a sports jacketand take off my brain.” Ben Hecht“Hollywood has the finest brains in the world outthere. But they’re up against all these vested interests, and vested interestsare the very devil for the artist.” Frank O’Connor“My principal feeling about Hollywood is suicide. IfI could get out of bed and into the shower, I was all right. Since I never paidthe bills, I’d reach for the phone and order the most elaborate breakfast Icould think of, and then I’d try to make it to the shower before I hangedmyself.” John Cheever“The only –ismHollywood believes in is plagiarism.” Dorothy Parker“Itt was a hideous and untenable place when I dweltthere, populated with few exceptions with Yahoos, and now that it has becomethe chief citadel of television, it’s unspeakable.” S.J. Perlman“Hollywood money isn’t money. It’s congealed snow,melts in your hand, and there you are.” Dorothy ParkerWriters on Journalism:“Journalism is literature in a hurry.” MatthewArnold“Journalism is the entertainment business.” FrankHerbert“The difference between journalism and literature isthat journalism is unreadable and literature is not read.” Oscar Wilde“The indispensable requirement for a good newspaper:as eager to tell a lie as the truth.” Norman Mailer“Journalism is the ability to meet the challenge offilling space.” Rebecca WestAnd finally, for today:“I once saw a woman on an elevator carrying a bookof mine. She held the book backwards so I could see myself peering over herelbow. I found looking at myself very disconcerting and when she had left theelevator I had a terrible feeling that she was taking my face away with her,leaving me nothing to shave in the morning.” John CheeverHope you enjoyed these!

I really think this is going to be my breakout novel.Thefirst one I’m throwing at you is one of my favorites, from Scottish writerHelen FitzGerald. Because of the title and content, it was suggested I ask somewomen writers for their take on it and here’s what Helen had to say:So, I’m reading Les Edgerton’s TheRapist. The title has already made me uneasy.Five pages in and I can hardly breathe.Ten and I’m nauseous.For the next 50, I’m a mixture of all of the above, but most ofall, angry.I feel like ringing my feminist friends and confessing: Sisters,I’m reading something you will kill me for reading.I feel like ringing my ex colleagues - parole officers andpsychologists who work with sex offenders in Barlinnie Prison, Glasgow - andasking them if they think it’s helpful to publish an honest and explicittranscript which shows the cognitive distortions of a callous, grandiose,articulate sex offender; one which illustrates his inability to have arelationship with a woman and his complete lack of empathy?I’m thinking I don’t know what I should be thinking.Will it turn sex offenders on?Should we listen to this guy?Is it possible to separate the person from the offence, and toempathise with him as he waits to die?I don’t ring anyone. I read on.And the breathlessness, nausea, anger and confusion increase allthe way to the end, at which point all I know is that the book is genius.HelenFitzGerald, author, Dead Lovely, BloodyWomen, The Devil’s Staircase, The Donor and others.Thankyou so much, Helen!

A writer must be as objective as achemist; he must abandon the subjective line; he must know that dungheaps playa very respectable part in a landscape, and that evil passions are as inherentin life as good ones.” Anton Chekhov“It isby sitting down to write every morning that one becomes a writer. Those who donot do this remain amateurs.” Gerald Brenan“Thereis only one place to write and that is aloneat a typewriter. The writer who has to go intothe streets is a writer who does not know the streets… when you leave your typewriter you leave your machine gun and the ratscome pouring through.” Charles Bukowski“Listencarefully to first criticisms of your work.

It islike passing around samples of one’s sputum.” Vladimir Nabokov“A goodmany young writers make the mistake of enclosing a stamped, self-addressedenvelope, big enough for the manuscript to come back in. That is too much of atemptation to the editor.” Ring Lardner“Writingis a wholetime job: no professional writer can afford only to write when he feelslike it.” W. Somerset Maugham“Everyonewho does not need to be a writer, whothinks he can do something else, ought to do something else.” Georges Simenon“Onceyou start illustrating virtue as such you had better stop writing fiction. Dosomething else, like Y-work. Or join a committee. Your business as a writer isnot to illustrate virtue, but to show how a fellow may move toward it—or awayfrom it.” Robert Penn Warren“Unlessyou think you can do better than Tolstoy, we don’t need you.” James Michener“Betterto write for yourself and have no public, than write for the public and have noself.” Cyril Connolly“If youwant to get rich from writing, write the sort of thing that’s read by personswho move their lips when they’re reading to themselves.” Don Marquis“You can’twant to be a writer; you have to beone.” Paul Theroux“Advice toyoung writers who want to get ahead without any annoying delays: don’t writeabout Man, write about a man.” E.B.

{"title": "WRITER QUOTES", "date": "Thursday, January 24, 2013", "text": "Hifolks,Offthe beaten track a bit today. It seems today’s writers are just a bit toopolite. Nobody wants to say someone is a twit even when it’s obvious. I kind ofliked the “good old days” when writers would talk about other writers they didn’tlike or respect, before that monstrosity that undermines free speech calledbeing “politically correct” took hold and silenced opinion.Opinionis what writers should be about. We’re about the only ones who halfway expressours nowadays. You can’t find a politician who does, can you? At least one youcan believe…Justwant to share what some writers of yore used to say about their peers and otherliterary matters. I got these from one of my favorite books, W.O.W.

{"title": "Review of Terrence McCauley's PROHIBITION", "date": "Monday, January 14, 2013", "text": "Hi folks,Today, I want to give some props to a friend of mine, Terrence McCauley, and his new novel, PROHIBITION. Terrence is an amazing writer and this is a book I really could not put down until I reached the end. Writing students could study this for its pacing alone.Hope you trust my judgment and show Terrence some love by glomming onto his book if it looks like your cup of tea. Don't forget to hit the \"Like\" button and if you can, provide a review for him.PROHIBITION by Terrence McCauleyAt one time, it was assumed pulp fiction died in thefifties, but the genre is making a solid comeback these days. One of thepublishers responsible for its rebirth is Airship 27. What is noteworthy isthat original pulp fiction novels were famous both for their stories and fortheir cover art. In fact, individual artists would develop a reputation bybeing able to convey what the story was about with just a glance at the cover.Airship 27 has recognized this by giving readers outstanding work in bothareas, as evidenced by their latest release, Terrence McCauley’s PROHIBITION,featuring ex-boxer and now mob enforcer Terry Quinn as the tough-as-barbed wireprotagonist and illustrated by Rob Moran with Shannon Hall providing thecoloring of Moran’s images. The result is a veritable return of the glory daysof pulp. Each on their own—either McCauley’s story or Moran’s art—are worth theprice of admission. Together, they’re worth much, much more.Rarely have I encountered a novel that made me turn thepages at such a breathless pace. Mob enforcer Terry Quinn is destined to havehis own wax figure unveiled if ever they create a pulp fiction hall of fame.PROHIBITION has it all—mob guys, gorgeous broads, speakeasies, Tommy guns,crooked politicians, smarmy reporters, Molotov cocktails, blood and bodiesgalore—everything pulp fiction fans want in their reading pleasure is here. Myfirst thought after I read “The end” was that I wanted to read more Quinn. Whata wonderful character! He’s realistic, original, and yet so true to theoriginal pulp fiction milieu that it was like picking up one of those wonderfulclassics of yesteryear that I thought had disappeared forever. It’s back andwith a vengeance!McCauley immerses us not only into a physical world that’stotally believable and based on real historical figures, but the novel is alsocentered around a mystery that is revealed in the same way a clever andtop-notch fighter reveals his skills in the ring to a respected opponent,little by little, round by round. Left hooks and right crosses come out atmoments when you least expect them and they have the same effect as a real-lifepunch would. They smack you in the solar plexus and take your breath away. Thepacing is superb. It just builds and builds and builds and the last third feelslike you’re hurtling along in one of those high-speed Japanese trains. Yousense immediately you’re in the hands of a writing master.When you read this—and you should—take a moment to savor thecover and the art that graces each chapter heading. The drawings will flat-outtake your breath away. Taken together—the art and the writing—signal a returnto the glory that was once pulp fiction and is again.Warning: Literary snobs may not enjoy it as much for itcontains the one thing that many of those folks detest—entertainment value.This isn’t about some middle-aged English prof contemplating his navel andwondering why his wife left him. Terry Quinn and other such characters are whyshe left him—they got tired of hearing the guy conjugate verbs and wanted tohook up with someone who actually had a life, did things and had a set of steelbeans in his jeans. That means that if you prefer your books to have sleepingpowder qualities—don’t start reading this book.You ain’t gonna sleep until it’s over.I've got some other writer friends who I owe reviews of their terrific books, but I kind of slid Terrence in here ahead of the pile--just because. I'm working on the others!Blue skies,LesJust posting this because it's one of my favorite pictures of my son Mike. This was his eighth-grade basketball team photo. He was about six feet tall then and played the post. Now, he's 6' 2\" and plays... the couch... (One thing that hasn't changed--he's still a babe magnet...)"},

They’ve now moved to Minnesota and I’m stoked to be goingto what looks like a fabulous resort. Click here for the website.THE WORKSHOP/RETREATCo-founded in 1987 by the late Gary Provost (author andinternationally acclaimed teacher of writing for publication) and his wife Gail,the ten-day WRITERS RETREAT WORKSHOP is an intensive learning experience forsmall groups of serious-minded writers who are committed to improving andcompleting their novels for submission. For those who consider their writing tobe a vital part of their lives, one they wish to develop as fully as possible,WRW provides the ideal experience. Jason Sitzes is the leader and one of the most knowledgeable and astute writing teachers in the nation.June 14 - 23Villa Maria Retreat and Conference CenterFrontenac, MN Register early to reserve yourspace (limited spaces available)You'll attend class each morning and be taught WRW's in-depth, step-by-step coursefor crafting your novel, of any genre, for publication. This is not formulaicnovel instruction. There is no such formula. Gary broke down novel structurescene-by-scene, dissected characters, taught how to choose words with impact,and shared many other fine details novelists must learn as second nature. Here,at WRW, we review these stylistic tools over and over throughout the week untilyou leave feeling equipped, inspired, and revitalized about your novel. Wedon't teach the art-- we teach the craft and instruct you on how to nurture theartist. Class instruction uses examples from classic to bestsellers of thatday. Prior to the workshop you will be given a list of books used and a seriesof pre-workshop assignments. During the workshop you will be given assignments,then go back to your private room or one of the various outdoor spots to write.All work focuses on your novel, so while you work on your story'sstructure, our dedicated staff will be available to brainstorm with you on yourplot. In small group sessions, while learning how to diagnose your own andothers' style strengths and weaknesses, you'll also boost your editing skills.Other optional activities include 7am Early Bird sessions, eveningwine and appetizer Shop Talks (featuring agents, instructors, students, andauthors), Book Signing night, 10pm Night Owl Sessions, and ample 1-1opportunities with core and visiting staff. WRW is as close to a ten-day, 20+hour workshop as you can get. It's unparalleled in what it offers.And most of all, if you want only a nice writing retreat in which you work onyour book and socialize when needed-- it's that as well. The only request ofnew participants is that you attend the morning sessions based on GaryProvost's groundbreaking course-- and you'll want to anyway. WRW is immersionin the writing world whether you're writing genre, literary fiction, children'sliterature, memoirs, short stories, or any number of creative writingendeavors. That's why top agents and authors return year after year.Assisting you throughout the ten days will be WRW mentors and In-Residenceguests, including authors/agents/editors who will share with you the truthabout today's publishing \"business\" and --when they meet with you --how best to market your novel-in-progress.Folks, I’ve been privileged to have been able to participate in a lot ofgreat events, but truly, nothing matches WRW. It’s just amazing. I canguarantee you won’t want to leave when the time comes!The trip there is going to be fantastic. A very good friend, Bob Stewart, isdriving his Jeep up from where he lives in San Antonio to pick me up. Along theway, another friend, Carl Brush, is flying into Louisville from his home inOakland, California, where he’ll meet up with Bob and they’ll drive up to Ft.Wayne to pick me up and then we’ll continue to Minnesota. Road trip!And, then... one of my true heroes, crime/noir/literary writer Anthony Neil Smith, who lives in Minnesota, is going to meet us for adult beverages and adult conversations one day in Minneapolis! I'm looking forward to that as much as the retreat itself! This is just an up-close-and-personal writer’s event. We spend the entireday on various writing lectures, exercises, seminars and all kinds ofwriting-related activities and then at night, will hang out and enjoy adultbeverages and wonderful socializing and mingling. It’s a writers’ Nirvana!I know I’m going to meet many old friends and a lot of folks come back everyyear from all over the world and am going to make new friends also.If you can makeit, I’d strongly urge you to consider going. It will be an experience you’lltreasure all of your life.Blue skies,LesPHOTOS FROMPREVIOUS WRW’S"},

{"title": "Brass Monkey Award!", "date": "Thursday, December 13, 2012", "text": "Hi folks,Well, it's official. I've finally arrived on the literary landscape. I'vejust won the prestigious literary award, the virtual Brass Monkey Award, givenout after months, weeks, days, minutes seconds of serioussome deliberation by the award-winning committee of a dozen, severalone, namely, the ubiquitous Anonymous 9, who also goes by the street name ofElaine Ash down at her neighborhood Starbucks and the Bucket O Blood Yuppie Barand Juice Emporium where she hangs out frequents when appearing inpublic for her adoring fans.Author Elaine Ash, A.K.A. \"Anonymous 9\" (Caught smoking a lipstick... by a People Magazine photog...)It seems Ms. Anonymous wrote a really cool book that I reviewed for Amazonand Goodreads and she liked (I think) the review and that’s the story of how Icame to win this fantastic award from her.Here’s my review:HARDBITE by Anonymous 95 starsAbsolutelyloved this book. I’m a sucker for vigilante tales and this is one of the bestI’ve read in a long time. Plus, it had the bonus of the “crusader” employing ahelper monkey to assist him. Unless there’s a genre featuring helper monkeysthat everyone else knows about and I don’t, this is only the second novel I’veever read that featured one. The first was John Vernon’s magic realism novel, Peter Doyle in which the protagonist, onthe hunt for Napoleon’s penis, owned a monkey he’d fashioned from body partsand when he was low on cash, would help fill the coffers by leaping on thebacks of sailors, slash their throats and take their purses. Anonymous 9’s useof a helper monkey in Hard Bite,while different, was equally delightful and original. Just wondering how thefolks at PETA liked it… Since I eat meat as often as I can, I’m without theirprohibitions concerning critters and I give it a 5 out of 5 stars… Just adarned good read!Here is what Anon 9 had to say in her blog post announcing my award:Anonymous-9’s Brass Monkey Award goes to LES EDGERTON forpublishing a review of HARD BITE on Amazon and getting in a lengthy referenceto Napoleon’s penis. Is there any reference toNapoleon in HARD BITE? No! Is there anything about Napoleon’s penis in HARDBITE? No! No! So for sheer ingenuity and creativity in review writing whichonly the great LES EDGERTON could manage, the virtual Brass Monkey Award goesto him.

{"title": "A TOTALLY PLEASURABLE INTERVIEW!", "date": "Tuesday, December 4, 2012", "text": "Hi folks,I just took part in one of the mostpleasurable experiences I’ve ever had as a writer. Twelve-year-old JaimeBeaumont read my YA thriller, MIRROR, MIRROR, and elected to write a bookreport on it for her class. Part of the project involved her interviewing meand below is that interview. Her mother told me that she hadn’t helped her atall—the questions were wholly Jaime’s—and they’re some of the best questions I’veever been asked about my writing. I think she’s got a very bright future as aninterviewer should she ever elect to! And… Paris Review interviewers? Look out—herecomes your future competition!The inestimable Jaime Beaumont!Jaime Beaumont interview with authorLes Edgerton over his YA thriller novel, Mirror, Mirror, for the 7thGrade Language Arts Class, Teacher--Ms. Bangs, Calibre Academy in Surprise,AZ Question: What made you write a YA novel?A. I began this book not eventhinking of publication. I simply intended it as a personal gift for my thenpre-teen daughter, Britney. I wanted to use whatever talent I had as a writerto create something just for her. Britney was an avid reader and especiallyenjoyed fantasy and “scary” books, so I began to think of ways I could scareher that weren’t along the lines of “the monster under the bed” or in thebasement. Something that, if created cleverly, could come across as apossibility in the imagination. I’ve just never thought vampire or zombienovels were scary, simply because I’m pretty sure they don’t exist, so I wantedsomething that could be seen as possible. I think Mirror People are infinitelymore of a possibility than zombies… Kind of a parallel universe…Question: Will you ever write another YA? If so, will it berelated to Mirror, Mirror?A. I’ve been thinking about it andit would be fun to write another one. And, yep, I think it would be acontinuation of Mirror, Mirror. Afterall, I did leave her evil mirror twin Liz in a place where she could escape andbegin wrecking Elizabeth’s life all over again…Question: Where did you get the idea for Mirror, Mirror?Answer: We were living in atwo-story cabin on Big Chapman Lake near Warsaw, Indiana, and one morning, ournine-year-old daughter Britney came out of her bedroom upstairs and stood atthe top of the stairs looking down at her mom Sheila and me. She had about halfan hour before she had to go to school. She was dressed in blue, from head tofoot. She was always a bit dramatic and she put her hand on her hip with regalhaughtiness and announced: “I’m in a blue mood today.” Sheila and I justlaughed our butts off! She promenaded downstairs and Sheila whispered that sheought to have her change, but didn’t want to stifle her creativity so she’d lether go to school that way. Britney paraded down the stairs like she was theQueen of England and waltzed up to a full-length mirror on our downstairsbedroom door, turning and twisting every which way to admire herself in herblue top, blue skirt, blue socks… and green shoes.... A miniature KatherineHepburn… That’s when I had one of those Aha! moments and knew not only that Iwanted to write a story for her but what my story was going to be about. Andso, Mirror People came to life. The more I thought about it, the more I couldsee the possibilities. As soon as she left for school (still dressed in allblue) I sat down at my typewriter (yes, this was before computers) and began tocreate Mirror World. I named my protagonist Elizabeth for two reasons. One, itwas Britney’s middle name, and two, it lent itself to using two forms of thename for the two characters.Question: In the story, why did Liz try to ruin Elizabeth'slife?Answer: Well, as a writer, I knowthat stories are always about one thing. Trouble. What could be more troublethan discovering you have a twin inside the mirror who looks like she’d be afun companion, only to discover she’s tricked you into trading places and thenproceeded to ruin your life while you looked on helplessly, trapped in a mirrorprison? I don’t start out to write any book with a theme in mind—that alwayscomes later upon the rewrite when I figure out the theme and then take outeverything that doesn’t fit it—but it was soon evident that the theme was envy.Elizabeth had these mud-brown eyes (like Britney) and had always wished forwhat she perceived as the more glamorous color of blue. It’s what gets her introuble. Liz has those glorious blue eyes she’s always wanted and it’s thatenvy that gets her into trouble.Liz tries to ruin Elizabeth’s lifebecause she has no substance and no conscience. She’s not real and because she’snot real, she’s never had the benefit of loving parents who provide direction,discipline and guidance to her life. She’s suddenly free and without much of aprior structure or moral guidance in her life, simply goes amok. All of us havetwo sides—our “light” side and our “dark” side, and Liz is simply Elizabeth’sdark side unleashed. She has no parameters. It wasn’t that Liz’s aim was toruin Elizabeth’s life—her aim was to have her version of “fun” and to live inthe hedonistic moment. Only problem was, her idea of fun had disastrous resultsfor the real Elizabeth.Question: When you were writing this book, did you alwaysknow what would happen next?Answer: Great question! The answeris—not at all! I simply kept asking “what if” questions. What if people had mirrortwins? What if they could trade places? What if the mirror person wouldn’t letthem trade back? What if this girl--who had the perfect parents, thenot-so-perfect-but-still-loveable little brother, the almost-perfect boyfriend,the perfect grades, the perfect friends—what if such a girl was suddenlytrapped inside a mirror and replaced by her evil twin who everybody thought washer? That’s how I write all of my books. I play “what if?” games. I try to getthem into bad places where I don’t know how they’re going to escape. I do thisin all of my books. I get them in a corner and don’t have a clue how they’llget out. My every thought until I come up with a solution is on their situation.In fact, I keep pen and paper by my bedside and more often than not, the answerwill come to me when I’m asleep. I’ll wake up and jot it down quickly before Iforget. It’s a process I’ve followed for many years and many times I think I’vedone it now—I’ve got a character in a place that’s impossible to extricate herfrom—but the answer always comes. I’ve learned to trust the process. It’s fun,especially when you come up with turns that get your character into worse andworse trouble. It’s almost like reading the novel for the first time yourselfsince you don’t know what’s going to happen.And, I’ve come to believe thatMirror World is out there. I think it’s simply a tool the folks in a paralleluniverse have discovered that allows them to visit our world and even enter it.Eventually, people in our universe—like Elizabeth—will discover that there’sanother world inside that piece of glass they stare into… My advice is to neverstare into a mirror for more than ten seconds at a time. Look away, even if fora second… Another piece of advice I’d pass on is to be happy with what you’vegot if what you want isn’t possible… like a different color of eyes. Unless, ofcourse, you want to invest in colored contact lenses…Thanks, Jaime, for some truly greatquestions—this was a lot of fun and you made me think hard about my writing andthat’s always valuable.Well, folks, that’s our interview!Hope you enjoyed it as much as I did.Blue skies,LesBritney and me when she was little. Get your copy here."},

Some serious momentsalso…Scheduled for release April, 2013 from New Pulp Press.Okay. I’ll admit it. I lied in the above description. Thething is, this isn’t a high-concept book that one can describe with aone-sentence, TV Guide logline. In fact, to describe it kind of gives it awayso I’m opting to provide pre-pub reviews by some authors I respect highly togive you a bit of an idea what it’s all about. OneSeveral Sentence Synopsis ReviewMeetTruman Ferris Pinter, condemned prisoner #49028, a snarling, wicked,silver-tongued misanthrope – a black hole of a man who sucks you in with thehuman gravity of his self-deception, then distorts your beliefs with thesuper-logic of his epiphanies. Oh, it’s all there – gut-grabbing lust, sex,hate and violence, deeply disturbing comments about our insane world – but TheRapist by Les Edgerton is much more than a new classic of ModernNoir. Against all odds, master wordsmith Edgerton has created the mostmesmerizing and disturbing narrator since Patricia Highsmith’s Tom Ripley, anintense, strange, well-spoken villain whose story and sexual perceptions willfrighten many more men than women. The Rapist is not who -- or what-- you think.Jack Getze,Fiction Editor, Spinetingler MagazineThe StoryAgain, I’m relying on a review.So,I’m reading Les Edgerton’s The Rapist.The title has already made me uneasy.Fivepages in and I can hardly breathe.Tenand I’m nauseous.Forthe next 50, I’m a mixture of all of the above, but most of all, angry.Ifeel like ringing my feminist friends and confessing: Sisters, I’m readingsomething you will kill me for reading.Ifeel like ringing my ex colleagues - parole officers and psychologists who workwith sex offenders in Barlinnie Prison, Glasgow - and asking them if they thinkit’s helpful to publish an honest and explicit transcript which shows thecognitive distortions of a callous, grandiose, articulate sex offender; onewhich illustrates his inability to have a relationship with a woman and hiscomplete lack of empathy?I’mthinking I don’t know what I should be thinking.Willit turn sex offenders on?Shouldwe listen to this guy?Isit possible to separate the person from the offence, and to empathise with himas he waits to die?Idon’t ring anyone. Iread on.Andthe breathlessness, nausea, anger and confusion increase all the way to theend, at which point all I know is that the book is genius.HelenFitzgerald, author, Dead Lovely, BloodyWomen, The Devil’s Staircase, Donor and others.What is the hook? What’s this book really about?‘Ilive in a small, dark realm which I fill out’. Jean Genet’s words in “MiracleOf the Rose”. And like Genet, Edgerton writes withlyricism and a sense of history of things that disturb, balancing through hissuperb style themes that may otherwise unsettle the narrative. Edgerton’s brilliant archaeological dig into the motivationsof a rapist is an unflinching look at the darker recesses of the human psyche.There is nothing gratuitous here and it takes a command to achieve a narrativepull in such territory. It reminded me of John Burnside’s “The Locust Room” butit’s better written. Edgerton voices the demonic forcesat work within his narrator’s head. He embeds the story with the protagonist’sneed for redemption set against the backdrop of his life. \"TheRapist\" is confessional, poetic, unrelenting, and as real as the newspaperlying before you. It challenges the assumption that fictions need to censor thethings people read every day in what is deemed factual. It is told in a stylethat situates it among the classics of transgressive fictions. Richard Godwin, Apostle Rising, Mr Glamour…and…Les Edgerton has written, in TheRapist, something that . . . that . . . well, defiesexplanation. Don't get me wrong; the writing is extremely powerful. The imageryis wonderful and startlingly clear. The emotions are vivid and visceral.Emotions that grab you physically and rattle your teeth violently the furtheryou dip into his tale. But the question is . . . how do you define it?Nihilistic existentialism comes to mind as abasis for understanding. The realization that nothing . . . nothing . .. is real or meaningful. But somehow the definition falls flat. There is,ultimately, a purpose for what happens to the character. Better yet; there is adeep, almost Freudian, mystery that grabs you and makes your imaginationsoar with the possibilities in understanding what is happening.I wouldn't say that, after you finishing reading The Rapist, you're going to have afeeling of satisfaction. In fact I strongly suggest you're going to feel as ifyou've just walked out of a House of Mirrors. You certainly will be confused,shocked, and puzzled.But you will realize that you've just read somethingamazingly original. Truly, magnificently, original.B.R. Stateham, author of ATaste of Old Revenge, Tough Guys: The Homicide Cases of Turner Hahn and FrankMorales and othersWhat inspired the book? Where did you get your idea?From reading Charles Bukowski’sshort story, “The Fiend.” The bravest fiction I’ve ever read, bar none. Iwanted to achieve what he accomplished there. In my mind, I have, but that willbe determined by the readers. I was also inspired by my own time in prison andfrom a guy in a cell next to mine who was in for rape and who turned out tohave been bumrapped and eventually declared innocent.What genre is this book?Literary. Existential. Noir. Philosophical. Who knows?Where and when can I read the book?In April of 2013 from New Pulp Press at all the usual onlineoutlets, although the publisher, Jon Bassoff is aiming for an earlier release.You’ll be able to purchase it as an ebook and as a paperback.Thanks,folks. Hope you glom onto a copy when it comes out. It’s easily the best thingI’ve ever written and it was exhausting to write. I don’t think I’ll ever haveagain the energy it took to write this book.

{"title": "NOVEL ENDINGS", "date": "Monday, November 12, 2012", "text": "Hi folks,This is a rerun of a post I ran some time back and I had a couple of requests to post it again. Hope you glean a few things from it to help inform your own writing! I’dlike to talk about novel endings and what makes a compelling finale to yournovel. There’s no way I can cover everything that goes into a great ending, butI’ll try to cover some of the more important elements.Beforewe get to the ending, we need to discuss what leads up to that point. Let’slook at basic story structure. Simplified, a novel structurally consists of aprotagonist and an antagonist as the two most important characters. Theprotagonist has something happen to him or her (inciting incident) that createsa surface problem (that’s actually symptomatic of a story-worthy problem) whichwill occupy him or her for the rest of the novel, trying to resolve it. Theantagonist also has a goal and it’s his or her goal that provides theopposition for the protagonist in resolving his or her goal. The struggle toresolve the problem(s) against increasing opposition occupies the majority ofthe novel.Itmight be helpful to define our terms before we begin.Protagonist: Simply theindividual through whose persona we (readers) experience the story.Iurge writers to never think of the protagonist as the “hero” or even “maincharacter.” To see this character as a hero reduces the character to aone-dimensional, cardboard character, ala “Dudley Doright.” Moral qualities,such as good and bad, shouldn’t apply to the protagonist or the antagonist. Canthey be good or bad? Sure, but to define them in that way as their chiefcharacteristic makes it likely you’ll create cartoonish characters rather thanfully-developed literary characters. To see this character as your “maincharacter” reduces the value of characterization to the novel andoveremphasizes plot. And, there is one protagonist per novel, not several. Not“co-protagonists” or multiple protagonists. That person can have multiple“helpers” or aides or helpers or even equal partners, but it needs to be one person we see.Antagonist: The individualwhose goal conflicts with that of the protagonist’s surface problem goal alwaysand sometimes the story-worthy goal as well.It’seven more important not to think of the antagonist as a villain. Even more sothan the protagonist, that can really lead to a Snidely Whiplash type ofcharacter. Can he or she be a bad or evil person? Certainly, but you’ll createa much more believable and interesting character if you simply view that personas an individual whose goal conflicts with that of the protagonist. The villaincan also have as many lieutenants or allies as you wish.Incitingincident: Somethingthat happens to the protagonist that creates and/or reveals the surface storyproblem to the protagonist. The inciting incident is what needs to begin thecontemporary novel. Anything before that event is backstory or setup and shouldn’tprecede the inciting incident beginning. If the backstory is important, it cancome later, once the reader is invested in the protagonist’s problem. Novelsare about one thing only and always—trouble. Today’s novels need to begin whenthe trouble begins, not before. And, the trouble has to begin with the incitingincident as before that happens there is no trouble, at least not in storyterms.Surface storyproblem: Abona fide problem that is revealed to the protagonist as a result of theinciting incident. While it is a serious problem, it’s not as serious as the story-worthy problem it’s symptomaticof. Usually, it’s posed as a somewhat superficial goal—love, money, solving acrime, achieving success of some kind, etc.Story-worthyproblem:The “real” problem of the protagonist and which the surface problem issymptomatic of. It’s usually a deep-seated psychological problem. Thestory-worthy problem isn’t known to the protagonist at the beginning of thestory. It is only through the struggle to resolve the surface problem that themore important problem begins to be revealed, and the full realization isusually achieved in the final scene when both the surface problem andstory-worthy problem are resolved. Although the story-worthy problem isn’trevealed to the protagonist until they’ve gone through the struggle to resolvethe surface problem, the author should be aware of it so that he or she cancreate an effective plot to get to that point.Plot: A plot is simply a point-by-point listof all the causal actions that the protagonist takes to resolve the problem. Aplot will show such things as: inciting incident, which leads to awareness ofproblem, first step to resolve the problem, which leads to disaster (failure toachieve the main goal), which leads to step two and so on, against increasingopposition, until the last scene in which the problem is resolved. The “spine”of the book and the plot is the protagonist’s problem and that problem shouldcolor every single page in the novel and be behind every action he or shetakes. If coincidence occurs, it must always have a negative effect on theprotagonist and should never be the source of help or in resolving the problem.If coincidence helps the protagonist, then what you have is what is called an…idiot plot. Don’t go there!Goals: Both theprotagonist and the antagonist have goals. Each of their goals is to resolvetheir individual surface problems. While the protagonist will also end uphaving a story-worthy problem goal, the antagonist doesn’t. His or hers is onlya surface problem that just happens to be in conflict with the protagonist’sproblem.Thesedefinitions may or may not be instantly clear to you at this point, but afterour time here together should be. I’d just like you to be aware of them so thatthis makes sense as you read on.So,okay, where’s the stuff about novel endings? Relax! It’s coming, I promise.Toillustrate all of this, I’d like to use a teaching model I use quite often. Thefilm, Thelma & Louise, written byCallie Khouri. It’s a film most people have seen so it should be a familiarmodel. You might want to rent it again to refresh your memory.Let’sgo through the story.First,the inciting incident. Remember, this is somethingthat happens to the protagonist that creates and/or reveals the surface storyproblem.Theinciting incident in T&L is inthe beginning, where the protagonist, Thelma (no co-protagonists here, althoughsometimes people mistakenly think Louise is a co-protagonist.) She’s not. She’sthe Older Mentor character, if you want to ascribe a label to her. The incidentoccurs when Thelma’s talking to her husband Darryl as he prepares to leave forwork. It’s been established that she is required to ask his permission beforeembarking on her weekend trip with Louise. She starts to ask him twice for thatpermission. There’s important backstory here, but it’s not revealed until muchlater in the story when the two women pick up J.T. and talk and Thelma revealsshe’s been married to him for four years and dated him through all four yearsof high school. The backstory is that she’s been with Darryl for eight yearsand probably in an abusive relationship. That’s shown by the way they talk to eachother. All that’s needed. The intelligent reader/viewer “gets” that instantly.Thelmais fully aware she’s in a bad situation, and, from time-to-time has performedactions to deal with it. She’s probably spit in Darryl’s food, gossiped andcomplained about him to Louise, not given her all in bed, whatever. Othertimes, she ignores her problem. But, it’s not yet to the point where it becomesthe biggest single problem in her life and at a stage where nothing can get inthe way of her resolving it. That’s what’s required to raise what’s only a “badsituation” to the level of becoming a story problem. If she can still ignore it for atime, can alibi what her true state is for a time to herself, can even forgether problem for a time… then it’s not yet a story problem... or a story. It’s only when she reachesher tipping point, when that “straw that broke the camel’s back” moment occursand reveals to her that it’s the singlebiggest problem in her life and that she can no longer ignore it, evenbriefly, that it becomes a story. In T&L,Thelma’s inciting incident is a small, dramatic moment. We’ve seen clearly viathe phone conversations with Louise that it’s imperative Thelma ask Darryl forpermission to go on the trip with her. She even begins to… twice. It’s thesecond time she starts to ask his permission that constitutes her incitingincident. It’s what Darryl does to her—remember?—the inciting incident issomething that happens to theprotagonist? What Darryl does, is something he’s no doubt done before, But—thistime it’s different. This time it’s the one time too many that he’s done this.And what does he do? Simple. She attempts to ask him the second time forpermission and he crudely and rudely dismisses her, treating her as anannoyance rather than as his wife and a person. It’s the tipping point for her,the inciting incident, the thing that finally reveals her problem clearly toher. (Keep in mind that the word “problem” in story terms doesn’t have the samedefinition as the lay term. In story terms, it’s more than a bad situation—it’sa problem that the protagonist won’t let go away until it’s resolved.)Here’sthe actual scene:THELMA goes through theliving room to the bottom of the stairs and leans on the banister.THELMA(hollering again)Darryl! Honey, you’d better hurry up.DARRYL comes trotting downthe stairs. Polyester was made for this man and he’s dripping in “men’s”jewelry. He manages a Carpeteria.DARRYL(annoyed)Dammit, Thelma, don’t holler like that! Haven’t I told you I can’t stand it when you holler in the morning?THELMA(sweetly and coyly)I’m sorry, Doll, I just didn’t want you to be late.DARRYL is checking himselfout in the hall mirror and it’s obvious he likes what he sees. He exudesconfidence for reasons that never become apparent. He likes to think of himselfas a real lady-killer. He is making imperceptible adjustments to his overmousedhair. THELMA watches approvingly.(My note. This was the setup. Now comes the inciting incident.)THELMA          Hon.DARRYL(still annoyed)What.THELMA(she decides not to tellhim.)Have a good day at worktoday.DARRYL          Uh-huh.THELMAHon?DARRYL(as if he’s trying toconcentrate.)What?!THELMA          You want anything special for dinner?And,that’s the inciting incident. For perhaps the hundredth time (or more!) intheir relationship, she started to do what she’s always done in the past—askfor her husband’s permission to go on the trip. But… something’s different thistime. With his evident attitude—his crude dismissal of her and of anythingshe’s trying to say—she reaches her limit. Before this point, she’s just put upwith him and played the dutiful wife. This time, her problem is clearly revealed to her. The little light in therefrigerator of her mind just clicked on. This is why it’s important tounderstand the complete definition of the inciting incident. (The incitingincident is something that happens to the protagonist that creates and/or reveals the story problem toher.) If she has what appears to be a problem but it’s not clearly revealed toher that she has, then it’s not yet a problem in story terms. It has to berevealed and clearly to her. That’s the only thing in the definition that has to be there in the inciting incidentscene. The problem—at least to others—may have been there for a long time. Shemay have even been very aware of a bad situation. But, until that moment whenit reaches the level of being the most important problem in her life—a problemthat she can’t ignore another minute until it’s resolved—it’s only a badsituation and not a story problem.Also,the inciting incident should be a dramaticscene, not a melodramatic one. And this is. A small, dramatic opening should then begin to build until the biggest scene ofall—the final one. Many writers make the mistake of thinking they have to openwith not a dramatic scene, but a melodramatic one. If you open with a murder,kidnapping, bomb explosion and the like—where do you go from there? Moremurders, more kidnappings, bigger bombs? This is not to say a novel can’t openwith that kind of thing, but if your novel’s not a thriller, per se, you mightwant to reconsider that strategy.Somebelieve the inciting incident was when Harlan tried to rape Thelma. Nope.That’s just the “Point of No Return” moment. That event wouldn’t have even beenpossible if Thelma had asked for Darryl’s permission. That was the realinciting incident—an event from which everything else derived.AndDarryl isn’t the antagonist. Not even close. He’s a one-dimensional, cardboardcharacter. A cartoon. Snidley Whiplash. The antagonist? Hal, the Arkansas cop.Remember, Thelma’s goal, as it evolves, is to escape being caught and forced to exist in a male-dominated world. Hal’s goalis to catch her. He’s not a bad guy at all (remember, I said to not think ofthe antagonist as a “villain?”). He’s one of the best and nicest guys in thestory. He wants to save the two women, first from going to jail, and in theend, from being killed. His goals are strictly good and honorable. His goalsimply opposes Thelma’s goal and that’s the only definition of an antagonist.Thelma’ssurface problem is to escape Darryl’s domination… for a weekend. Seeing who andwhat kind of  person her husband is,creates instantly reader identification for her as well as sympathy andempathy. Already, we’d like to see her have some fun. It’s obvious she’s hadvery little with this butthole.So,her surface problem is Darryl’s domination of her. But, remember I said thesurface problem is only symptomatic ofthe much bigger, much more important, deeper psychological problem theprotagonist faces? It’s very true in this story. The story begins with Thelmatrying to resolve the surface problem—escaping Darryl’s domination, even if forjust a weekend—but, as events progress, little by little, Thelma eventuallycomes to the realization that she has a much bigger problem. That she’s forcedto exist in a male-dominated world. It’s much bigger than just Darryl as she gradually comes to realize as events progress.Iwanted to go over these things so that the ending—which is what this is allabout!—makes complete sense. Now. Here’s the definition of a quality ending:Ending: A novel endingshould contain two elements—a win and a loss. That’s in terms of theprotagonist’s goals, both surface and story-worthy. Years ago, we used to teachwriters that endings should be either “goal-achieved” or “goal-unachieved.”Like most things, we’ve learned better ways to express story structure. Anending that only achieves the protagonist’s goal as well as an ending in whichis the protagonist’s goal is lost are both incomplete and unsatisfactoryendings. There must be elements of both to make it a good ending.Likeeverything important in a story, the ending should always be presented as ascene. Never by exposition or summary or the character ruminating in his/herhead. Through a scene. And, there are particular requirements for this scene.As Janet Burroway, in her classic text, WritingFiction, says about resolutions: “Here the epiphany, a memory leading to aresolution, has been triggered by anaction and sensory details that the reader can share.” (Italics mine.) It’sa scene that can’t depend on conversation to make it work. It can’t, forinstance, have the protagonist talking to a priest who then convinces her of atruth, and that gives her her epiphany. The resolution has to be triggered by an action—and an “action”in this case, isn’t dialog. It has to be a physical action.What’sthe physical action in the ending of T&L?That’s easy. They’re just been chased and are now surrounded on all sides bycops who are ordering them to put their hands up or get killed. Surrounded onall sides except in front of them, where the Grand Canyon lies. Sensorydetails? Plenty! Cops jacking shells into carbines, a helicopter’s rotors swirlingdust, an authoritative voice over a bullhorn demanding they surrender. No wayout, except… This triggers the epiphany for Thelma. And, what is the memorythat leads to a resolution for her? Again, easy. Even though we can’t see it inthe film, we understand what’s going through her mind. The memory of Darryl andher abusive relationships, and, even more important, the new knowledge that herentire world is controlled by men as evidenced by what’s happened in theirjourney. Selfish men, like Darryl, evil men like the tanker truck driver andHarlan, the would-be rapist, manipulative men like J.T., and even good, moralmen, like Hal and Louise’s boyfriend, Jimmy. But… all men. At the very end,Thelma realizes her surface problem (getting free of Darryl, even if just for aweekend) is only symptomatic of a much bigger and deeper, psychological problemfor her—having to exist in a male-dominated world with no voice at all. Shedidn’t know this at the beginning. In the beginning, she was only aware thatDarryl was a shit. In the end, as a result of everything she’d gone through,she finally comes to the realization that Darryl was only a small part of whatshe faced in society.Andso, she does the only thing left for her to do. She and Louise tacitly agree tocommit suicide. They seal their decision with a kiss and then hold hands asthey hurtle into infinity. And, that, satisfies the two elements in a qualityending, by providing both a win and a loss. The loss? Easy. She gives up herlife. The win? Again, easy. She achieves her independence from men on her ownterms. It cost her her life, but the tradeoff was worth it to her.Thisis a fairly common ending. It’s seen, for instance, in Toni Morrison’s novel Beloved, where the mother kills herchild to keep her from having to live in slavery. It’s seen in any number ofwar novels where the protagonist gives up his or her life to preserve a way oflife for loved ones.Thisdoesn’t mean protagonists have to commit suicide to achieve a good ending. Thisis just one of countless possible endings. But, however you end your story,just make sure it contains both a win and a loss for the protagonist. That’skey.What’sinteresting about this movie is that some of the studio execs wanted to changeKhouri’s brilliant ending to a typical Hollywood “happy-sappy” ending. Onewhere they surrendered, spent a few years in prison, and were released to liveout some kind of Stepford wives’ existence ever after…Thankfully,she stood her ground and they released the intelligent version!Hopethis helps you in creating your own endings. Hope to see your work on theshelves of Border’s and Barnes & Noble!Blueskies,LesEdgertonhttp://www.amazon.com/Mirror-ebook/dp/B009VNN40K/ref=sr_1_1_title_0_main?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1352770141&sr=1-1&keywords=mirror%2C+mirror+by+les+edgerton"},

{"title": "Interview on the Andrea Hurst website", "date": "Monday, November 5, 2012", "text": "Hi folks,Uber-literary agent, Andrea Hurst posted an interview I took part in with Katie Flanagan on Andrea's site awhile back and I thought I'd post it here for those who didn't see it at the time and might have some interest in reading it. Without further ado...AUTHORNOMICS Interview with LesEdgertonBy: Andrea HurstMarch 26th, 2012 Posted in AUTHORNOMICS InterviewSeries, Blog With a publishing industry that is ever in flux, it can behard for an aspiring author to figure out what information is relevant and whatshe needs to do to be successful. Recognizing this, literary agent Andrea Hurstand writer and blogger Katie Flanagan present a series of weekly interviewswith publishing industry specialists. The AUTHORNOMICS Series features literaryagents, editors, authors, marketing experts and more talking about theiropinions on the publishing industry, writing, and what a writer needs to know.Interview with Author Les EdgertonLesEdgerton is an ex-con, matriculating at Pendleton Reformatory for a couple ofyears in the sixties for burglary (plea-bargained down from multiple counts ofburglary, armed robbery, strong-armed robbery and possession with intent). He’ssince taken a vow of poverty (became a writer) with 14 books in print. 2011 wasa good year for him as he published two novels with StoneGate Ink—Just LikeThat and The Perfect Crime, along with noir novel The Bitchfrom Bare Knuckles Press, as well as a new short story collection, GumboYa-Ya, from Snubnose Press. He just sold his existential novella, TheRapist to New Pulp Press, which will be released in 2013. He is alsoeditor-at-large for Noir Nation International Crime Magazine.Work of his has been nominated for or won: the Pushcart Prize, O. Henry Award,Edgar Allan Poe Award (short story category), PEN/Faulkner Award, TexasInstitute of Letters Jesse Jones Book Award, the Violet Crown Book Award, andothers. He holds the MFA in Writing degree from Vermont College and aCertificate in Barbering from Pendleton Reformatory. He writes because hehates… a lot… and hard. Injustice and bullying are what he hates the most.1.      As a prolific author with14 books in print so far, can you elaborate on how the publishing process haschanged since your first book?It’s changed tremendously in some ways and barely at all inothers. I’m old-school, so I don’t count self-publishing as publishing. A horseby any other name is still a horse. In my opinion, it’s just another name forvanity publishing, which is not publishing but… printing (abeit in electronicform). I’m not including in that assessment legitimate publishers who publishebooks, but I am including those who simply publish the work themselves. I havefriends who’ve chosen to self-publish and while they’re still my friends, I’mnot going to purchase their books any more than I would the person who hasstacks of their vanity or subsidy-published books in their garage. Just want todefine the terms. And, there are degrees and shadings within even theself-published category. For instance, I’m getting ready to self-publish abook… but it’s a book that has been published and done well. It just never cameout in ebook form, so my agent got the ebook rights from the publisher andwe’re going to put it out. That, to me, isn’t the kind of self-published“vanity” book I’m referring to.Definitions provided, to answer your question, let meaddress what’s changed first. The biggest changes have come about because ofthe advent of ebooks.What’s changed is that if there was any doubt that mid-listauthors have disappeared, now there’s no doubt. At one time, legacy publisherswould publish a writer’s books knowing that they probably wouldn’t make anymoney on that particular book, but they saw something in the writer that madethem think that eventually an audience would build for that author and down theroad, they’d all make money on his or her novels. As Roberto Durante said, inanother context: “No mas.”The Big Six, in particular, are almost exclusivelyinterested in brand names. Proven winners who have a sizeable audience alreadyin place. Here’s a prime example. A few months ago, I was told in confidence bysomeone who is in the “know,” that a top editor for a major publisher, who hashis own imprint, was told by his boss (yes, even top editors have bosses), thatif he signed any novel that didn’t earn at least $30,000 he’d be fired. Notchastised, not given a talking to, or a slap on the wrist, but… fired.Think this guy is going to want to sign the brilliant novel by the unknownauthor or do you supposed he might opt instead for the same-as-the-last book byMr. Brand Name? Fugedaboutit. That’s one change.The second change I’ve observed is that so-called “literarynovels” are just about over. Remember: I’m just the messenger. Don’t kill themessenger! Here’s how I know this. For almost thirty years, my wife and I andour son until he moved out of the house, visited a local bookstore every singleweek. Never missed a week. Our favorite was Borders and our second favorite wasone of the two B&N outlets. One Saturday, we walked into Borders and stoodin shock at the change. The biggest single area the week before was the spacedevoted to what was labeled “Mainstream fiction.” Mainstream encompassesliterary fiction in bookstore terminology. They’d reduced that space fully bythree-fourths. The area that used to house literary fiction and other fictionthat didn’t fit a particular genre was reassigned. To two areas. Genre fictionwas one. The other was greeting cards, wrapping paper, novelty items. Cutelittle stuffed animals. I talked to the manager and she said she hated to do it,but all the Borders stores were under corporate mandate to do the same.Literary and mainstream fiction just weren’t selling. They couldn’t justify thespace devoted to it, so they reassigned it to genre fiction which was sellingand significantly. It’s a cold, hard fact, but the marketplace is whatdetermines what’s selling to publishers. Literary novels today are infinitelytougher to sell than ever before and that market is shrinking monthly. If youwant to know what the literary tastes of a nation are, simply gaze about at anational chain’s brick and mortar outlet and see what’s on the shelves. Thecategory area that has the most shelf space is the area that’s selling.Does this mean so-called “literary” novels are impossible toget published? No; it just means it’s much harder. They’ll continue to getpublished because legacy publishers in this instance are the same as major filmstudios. Major film studios will put out 85 movies that appeal to the biggestaudience demographic—teenaged boys—and the remaining 15 movies will be devotedto a mix of other kinds of films. Among those will be a couple of “artsy”movies. The ones that will be nominated for Golden Globes and Oscars. Most ofwhich they know they’ll lose money on. Then why make em? Because, studios wantto be thought of as intellectual, “arty” enterprises. Kind of an ego thing.They know most of what they produce is mindless schlock, but if they get anOscar winner or even a nominee, they feel justified that they produce “art.”And, for the one movie that does get nominated or win, they’ll actually makemoney on it because of the publicity. It’s mostly a way for studio execs tofeel good about themselves and be able to delude themselves into thinking thatthey’re actually engaged in quality work. Makes ‘em walk tall when they walkinto Spagos.Well, publishers do the same thing. For all the vampirenovels selling in the bazillions, all the formulaic cartoonish novels aboutbigger-than-life vigilante superheroes, that maintain a healthy bottom line, they’llall put out a few literary books that are published mostly because they’ll beup for the National Book Award, the Pulitzer, even the Nobel. For the samemotivation as the film studios. So they can feel like they’re “literary” andproviding “good literature.” Makes ‘em feel proud when they walk into theRussian Tea Room or Elaine’s or wherever they gather these days.Am I cynical? You bet.What are the things that have remained the same? Well, thelegacy publishers still employ the best gatekeepers in the business. If you getpublished by a legacy publisher, you’ve achieved something. You’re trulyvalidated by people who actually know something about quality in writing. Ifyou self-publish, your validation is going to come from your relatives, friends,and how effective you are at marketing, for the most part. Sales seem to be thebiggest factor in ebook publishing and sales are a poor barometer of quality.For example, there is an author who was, at best, a mid-list author when he wasbeing published by legacy publishers—his work is truly mediocre, at best—whohas become a huge marketing success since he opted for self-publishing. He’smaking lots of money—and that’s fine—but his work is still godawful. If salesare your measure of success, he’s a good model to emulate. If being regarded asa good writer is your measure, he’s probably not the guy whose bust you wantgracing your mantel. There’s a reason he went to self-publishing and it has todo with writing ability. His sales ability is off the charts. His writingability is… what’s the word?… oh, yeah… pure do-do.There are other changes and other things that remain thesame, but those are some of the biggest.2. You write novels, short fiction, nonfiction, andscreenplays. What is your favorite genre to work in and why?Novels, by far. They require the most creativity and themost ability. Short fiction would be second. Nonfiction for the money.Screenplays are last. The reason is, screenplays aren’t about writing. No onepicks up a screenplay to go sit in the hammock for a lazy-crazy afternoon oflosing themselves in a fictional world. And, screenplays are ridiculously easyto write. I wrote my first screenplay literally in two days. Took seven hoursthe first day, put it aside for two weeks, and then finished it in a nine-hourday when I picked it back up. Now, it’s easy to write a bad screenplay in twodays, so that doesn’t mean much. However, this particular screenplay placed asa semifinalist in the Nicholl’s competition and Greg Beals, the director of thefoundation told me it would have won if I’d sent it in the year before, but theprevious year’s winner was remarkably close to mine and he said they neverpicked two screenplays in a row that were this much alike. But, it placed inthe top 100 out of 4,500 entries. So, I take that as validation that it was agood screenplay. Written in two days. Don’t think I could write a novel likethat. And, I’d just learned formatting the week before and had read my firstscreenplay ever that same week. As Gore Vidal said about Jack Kerouac: “That’snot writing; that’s typing.” I don’t write them anymore because I’m too old.After the age of 35, it’s virtually impossible to sell a screenplay toHollywood. Notice I didn’t say “impossible.” I said “virtually” impossible.And, it is. Hollywood is clearly an ageist society in every segment of thebusiness except for producing. 3.      How did you go aboutmastering the craft of writing?That’s easy! By reading. That’s the only way to learn how towrite. There are no “secrets” in learning how to write. The “secrets” are rightout in the open. They’re on the page of the book you have open before you. Allyou have to do is see how the author accomplished what they did and you’relearning to write. I regularly get writers in my classes who haven’t read abook in months or even years and I know there’s no way they’ll ever be awriter. But, I’ll also encounter a student who has read voraciously from theage of five or six and never stopped, and I know that person has a chance atbecoming a writer. 4.      How important do youthink it is for fiction writers to obtain an MFA?Again, an easy question. I think it’s totally unimportant.In fact, I think most programs destroy more writers than help them. I kind ofagree with Flannery O’Connor who, when asked if writing programs discouragedwriters, said: “Not enough of them.” And I have one. I have two degrees—(well,three—I also have a B.A.)—an MFA and a Certificate in Barbering from PendletonReformatory. Of the two, I value my barbering certificate much, much more. I’vemade far more money, enjoyed far more success with that one.First, take a look at who the teachers and professors are inmost programs. What have they done and what have they sold? If Stephen Kingever showed up in an MFA program it would only be because he was slumming andbored and wanted a change. Most of the folks (not all!) teaching in many suchprograms are writing the kind of books Kurt Vonnegut was referring to when hesaid, “Literature is in danger of disappearing up its own asshole.”And, most MFA programs are dedicated to teaching “literary”fiction. I don’t know about you, but do I want to spend thousands of dollarsand use up a couple years of my life to learn to write something that’sbasically dying? I don’t know what your I.Q. is but mine’s over 160 and I tryto put it to use, especially for questions like this.Years ago, an Ivy League college performed a study in whichthey looked at a random group of a hundred professional writers. They identifiedthem as “professional” by the only legitimate definition of the term—writerswho earned their entire income from writing. They discovered that almostexactly half of these writers had a high school diploma or less… and the otherhalf had a college bachelor’s degree or higher. There’s really no correlationbetween writing education and writing success. What an MFA degree does do isgive the student access to decision-makers. Lots of publishers and editorsvisit these campuses and lots of editor’s eyes light up when they see “MFA” inthe writer’s query letter. However, most of these editors are the ones who arestill looking for literary novels and believe there’s a decent market for such.A shrinking number…These programs used to have more value even a few years agothan they do today. These days, they’re seen by many universities and collegesas “cash cows” and they’re springing up everywhere. And, like anything thatgets bigger like this, the quality goes down, commensurately. At one time,there were perhaps five-six pretty good programs. Now there are hundreds. Ifanyone thinks they’re as good and as beneficial for writers as they used to be,well I’d like their phone number because I have this terrific bridge inBrooklyn I’m trying to move…That said, there is one program I think is a great one andone I wish had been around when I got mine. Seton Hill focuses on genre writing(about time somebody did!), and everything I hear about it is positive. Theyappear to be a program that’s aware that it’s now 2012.5.      As a creative writingteacher, what are some of the most common mistakes that you see beginningwriters making in both fiction and nonfiction?Not following the two elements that are always present ingood writing. Be interesting and be clear. Of the two, being interesting is themost important. After that, there are structural problems that are very common.Most writers have never been taught story structure, or if they have, oftenit’s an archaic structure. Most English classes, most college writing classes,many MFA programs are focused on “parts” or writing. All these “exercises” ondescription, or characterization or dialog or whatever. Yuch! Listen, onedoesn’t get to Carnegie Hall by practicing the scales. They get there byunderstanding what a symphony is and how to write a complete symphony. I hateit when writers refer to what they’re writing as the “piece” they’re workingon. What in the hell is a “piece” of writing? Dude! Dudette! Write something that’scomplete and entire. A short story. A novel. Talk about your novel, not the“piece” you’re working on.The two biggest mistakes beginning writers make are notusing their own, particular, unique voice, and not beginning the story ofnonfiction article or book in the right place. After that, the next biggestproblem is not striving for and achieving what Flannery O’Connor said about thebest of novels (badly paraphrased) that they be: “All of a piece; all of aunified effect.” So many novels end up episodic with no through-line. In otherwords, a mish-mash of scenes and quirky characters. That’s a novel of which theauthor can say, truthfully, that it’s “only available in my room.”6.      One of your well-knownwriting books is Hooked: Write Fiction that Grabs the Reader at Page One andNever Lets Them Go. What are the important elements in hooking a readerearly?To begin where the story begins. It’s that simple. Acontemporary story is about one thing and one thing only. Trouble. That meansthe story should begin—when the trouble begins. Not the week before, nottwo years before, not even two minutes before. When the trouble begins.Period. And, that seems to be a difficult concept for many to master. Somethinghas to create and/or reveal that trouble to the protagonist. That event is theinciting incident. And, that’s where stories today need to begin.There was a time in our culture when novels could begin moreleisurely. This was a time before television and movies and CNN and iPods andall the other entertainment venues were upon us. Today’s reader doesn’t havethe attention span nor the interest in picking up novels with leisurelyopenings. That doesn’t mean stories should begin with gunfights, stabbings,bombs blowing up, kidnappings, murders, or any of that melodramatic stuff. Itmeans they have to open with conflict—the major conflict that forms the core ofthe story. It can be a quiet conflict, but what it can’t be is a lengthyaccount of the protagonist’s bucolic life for the ten years before the troublebegan. It has to begin with the trouble. Period.When movies began, they had no structural models, so theyused novels as their models. Today, it’s been reversed. Novels have to imitatefilm structure. Years ago, screenwriting how-to books insisted the first tenminutes of a screenplay be “devoted to the setup.” No mas, again quotingRoberto Duran. Those days are, in the words of my son, “so five minutes ago.”Films today begin… when the trouble begins. As should novels.We read a novel for one reason. To see if and how theprotagonist is going to resolve the story problem. If there’s no problem on thepage, for that novel the reader is going to become… a nonreader. Count on it.Very few (and they don’t count) readers pick up a book just to encounter in thebeginning a nifty shooting in an alley. If they don’t know the characters orthe protagonist’s story problem, why would they care? There are a millionplaces to see someone get shot. Just click on the nightly news. There has to bea reason to turn to Page 2. That reason is we see a character with a compellingproblem—one we can relate to—on Page 1.7. Beginnings are soimportant, especially in today’s marketplace. How does a writer determine ifthey have started their novel in the right place? Do you have an opinion onusing prologues?If they’ve begun with the introduction of the event thatcreated and/or revealed the problem that’s going to occupy the protagonist forthe following 349 pages, they’ve begun in the right place. If they’ve begunanywhere else—they haven’t.Also, that needs to be written in a scene. Everything trulyimportant in a novel needs to be delivered via a scene. Not through thecharacter’s ruminations or thoughts or that kind of thing. A scene. When I pickup a manuscript and it’s the character thinking on the page, my Nexium startsto malfunction and I can feel the bile beginning to rise and voila! I’mthrowing up in my mouth.The reason so many writers fail, is that they don’t writescenes. They write a character’s thoughts and ruminations. They deliverdescriptions of emotions based on events the reader hasn’t been witness to, viaa scene. Doesn’t work. I see this in high school students beginning to writepoetry. They deliver all these descriptions of emotions based on something thereader hasn’t been privy to and think that that’s poetry. It isn’t. The onlyway the reader is impacted emotionally is by living through the event rightalong with the character and at the same time. Period.Prologues? I think the vast majority… what’s the word?… oh,yeah… suck. Most aren’t needed. Now, for those who practice selective reading,I didn’t say “all.” I said “most.” Occasionally, one might work—although Ican’t think of any offhand. Most, I suspect, come from a writer who’s been admonishednot to begin with setup or backstory and just has to provide that crap… so theycreate a prologue. I use an example of one in a brilliant book. Larry Watson’s Montana1948. He uses one in his terrific novel and it won major awards and is oneof my favorite books. But, it wasn’t needed. Not at all.I feel the same about epilogues. Mostly, I think they comefrom writers who don’t know how to tie up the loose ends with the plot, so theystick ‘em on to accomplish that. I think most would be better served inlearning how to plot better… 8. How important do you think it is for authorsto maintain a strong social media presence?  What tips do you have forkeeping a successful writing blog?Mostly depends on who you are. If you’re Joyce Carol Oates,it’s probably not important in the least. If you’re Les Edgerton, it might be…I’m probably the wrong person to ask what it takes forkeeping a successful writing blog. I have one and I don’t know if I’d call itsuccessful or not! I mean, I only have 250+ followers. I’ve had more peoplewatch me pull off a crime… If numbers aren’t important, then I feel it’ssuccessful. I’ve made wonderful contacts through it and many that have helpedme not only sell my books but even helped me get them published. As to whatmakes it successful, I think it’s to base it on the same elements I feelimportant in a good novel. Be interesting and be clear. I don’t know if it’salways clear, but I do try hard to make it interesting. After all, there areabout sixteen bazillion blogs out there and if yours ain’t interesting, thenwho’s going to want to read it? I figure it it’s interesting to me, then itmight be interesting to others. Maybe not… I have weird tastes… I also have amean, contrarian side to me. I don’t believe in telling people necessarily whatthey want to hear. There are enough people out there in writing telling folksthey’re great and that writing’s easy and all that stuff. There are just lotsof folks who aren’t great and their writing sucks and somebody maybe ought to tellthem that. How else do we get better if we don’t know we’re bad?9.      On your blog, you haveposted the first chapter of your new writing book, A Fiction Writer’sWorkshop at the Bijou.  Do you think giving away the first chapter ishelpful for building sales?Good question! And, the answer is—I don’t know. I hope so.If the readers see it as valuable information—and early responses say itis—then I think it’ll prove helpful. Plus, although I plan on self-publishingit, chances are some editor or other gatekeeper will come across it and think:“Hey, I can sell that puppy.” And then ring me up on the telly. Who knows?After all, those folks whose first meeting with Ed McMahon was on their frontporches were real people getting those giant checks… 10.      Many authors arechoosing to self-publish now. Do you see that as a viable option? What are thepros and cons?Only under very special circumstances would I self-publish.And, I am for two books. One isn’t really self-publishing. We’ve obtained therights from Writer’s Digest for a very successful book they published of mine—FindingYour Voice—and I’m publishing an ebook version of it since they opted notto. I’m pretty sure there’s a sizeable audience. It earned out its advance of$8,000 within six weeks of its release way back when and every year has paid meexcellent royalties. I’m pretty sure there’s an audience for that book,particularly since it hasn’t appeared in ebook format.The second instance is the Bijou book you referred to above.If I was a beginning writer with no street cred, there’s no way I’dself-publish it. But, I’ve got a pretty decent track record with sales of myother two writer’s how-tos, so I’m fairly confident that will translate intodecent sales. Hooked just doesn’t let up in sales, year after year, sothat tells me I have an audience. Plus, I’ve delivered and continue to deliver,a four-hour workshop on the film I use as the basis of the book—Thelma &Louise—to writing groups and workshops and draw absolutely rave reviews forthe presentation, so I know there’s a significant audience for it and that itfills what I see as a hole in the writing how-to canon. Hope so, anyway! 11.      Do you have anyupcoming workshops, classes or author services to share with us?I’ve been invited to appear and do a reading of my work atNoir at the Bar in St. Louis at Subterranean Books on April 28 that I’m prettyjazzed about.

{"title": "THE ALMOND TREE--Update", "date": "Thursday, November 1, 2012", "text": "Hi folks,I just got an email from Michelle Cohen-Corasanti that touched me and I thought I'd share. She worked for five years on this novel and I was privileged to help some. Here's what Michelle had to say:Les,Things are going great. The Almond tree went into its second printing before it came to the US. I am shocked, but the Jewish community is embracing the novel. They are having the exact same reaction you had. They've been inviting me to speak. Last Friday, The Jewish Telegraph in the UK (circulation 50,000) ran a large article on The Almond Tree. I always send everyone your recommendation first on the page. But you really did make this happen.  Below is the amazing recommendation you wrote. It shows your keen understanding of what works and why and shows the greatness of your skill. I've made a small change because I believe you were far too humble. Can you post it on Amazon, Barnes and Noble, Goodreads and anywhere else? You should get credit for your class, editing, ability to know what will work even when a book is still a diamond in the rough and your ability to make things happen. Others should benefit from your expertise.I think I'm about to get another big break so I want you to post it before it happens and I want it to be among the first so it doesn't get lost in the shuffle. I've highlighted what I think should change.Michelle Manymonths ago, Michelle Cohen-Corasanti enrolled in one of my Writer’s Digest creativewriting courses on CALLED HOOKED, THE FIRST FIVE PAGES Story Beginnings. The novel she worked on in class was TheAlmond Tree. It was clear immediately that this was a writer of uncommon talentand promise. The problem—for me—was her subject material. She was writing whatseemed to be a pro-Palestinian book. All my life, I’ve been pro-Israeli. Apolitical stand derived from my upbringing in a fundamentalist Christian home,where we were taught from an early age that the Jewish people were God’s“chosen people,” and Israel, a God-favored state. I was taught (and firmlybelieved) that as long as the U.S. was an ally of Israel, that we were also anation under the grace of God. A pro-Palestinian novel simply went against allof my core beliefs. But, I consider myself a professional and I also ferventlybelieve in freedom of expression. So, while I disagreed with the theme of hernovel, she was never aware of my personal beliefs which I never revealed and Isimply worked with her in addressing her craft. And then… she asked if shecould hire me after class to coach her on her final rewrite. Now, I had amoral quandary. Could I, in good conscience, help someone in a work that wasfundamentally opposed to everything I believe in? I asked several Jewishfriends for their advice. I got differing views. Some said, I shouldn’t lend myname and whatever editing expertise I had to the project if I disagreed withthe politics. That wasn’t censorship, they argued, and I agreed. Others saidthat this was a professional matter and that my personal politics and beliefsshouldn’t be the deciding factors. After much soul-searching, I agreed with thelatter. At no time during the process did Michelle know of my beliefs. I pridemyself that I’ve never revealed to any of my students or writing clients mypersonal and political views nor let those views influence the way I workedwith them. The few who’ve learned of them have always been surprised, assumingI shared their own views. I’m proud of the fact that I’ve remained neutral whenworking with writers.Webegan to work together. At no time during this process was Michelle aware ofhow I felt about Palestinians and Israel. My only guide was to always treat hermaterial in a professional way and only look at it with the goal of helping hermake it the best novel she was capable of writing. It was only when she hadfinished, that I revealed my personal feelings about Israel and Palestine toher. And that her novel had changed my mind…What’s important about this lengthypreamble to what I have to say about Michelle Cohen and her novel, The AlmondTree, is that this novel—the intensely gripping story of a Palestinian boy andhis family and their suffering under Israeli occupation—convinced me withsurety that my beliefs about this conflict were severely flawed and had beenformed from a one-sided awareness. Her truly beautiful novel showed clearlythat there are always two sides to a question, something I’d forgotten. Inother words, Michelle wrote a novel which changed my mind about somethingimportant. That is the mark of a great work of art.It waseasy to see Michelle has talent—what convinced me that this will be a book thatwill achieve substantial sales and be nominated for prestigious awards—was thatthe story she created converted me from what I had assumed to be a committedand unyielding position to one in which I now see the Palestinian people asbelonging to the community of mankind every bit as much as any other group,including the Israelis.Somewill be tempted to compare The Almond Tree to The Kite Runner, but to do sounfairly places the two books in some sort of presumed ranking. Both of thesebooks are brilliant and powerful accounts and deserve to stand tall on theirown merits, irrespective of the other.Ichmad’sstory is a big-hearted story of a small Palestinian boy who learns to survivein a brutal environment and doesn’t simply endure, but emerges from the firewith the wisdom gleaned from the example of a father who has taught him thatall men have value, even their enemies. A tale of innocence moving through avicious world, compassion learned against an environment of daily horrors, andwisdom forged through a boy’s journey through a life we would never wish uponour own children. Michelle Cohen’s The Almond Tree is one of those rarest ofbooks—a fiction that rings with authenticity and integrity to reveal the wonderof what it really is to be human.If everpeace is to become a reality between Israel and Palestine, it will be becauseof the influence of books such as this. I am proud to have been allowed byMichelle Cohen to have played a very tiny I think you should takethat out. (I think you should say I’m proud to have been Michelle’s editor and tohave been able to help her transform her novel into …… (something like that. Iwant you and your editing skills and your course to get the publicity itdeserves. Les you did really make it happen) rolein the development of this novel. This is a book that I think will endure andresonate forever in the souls of all who read it. I know it will in mine. Somebooks have the power to change us profoundly; this is one of those books.Les EdgertonAuthor of The Death ofTarpons, Monday’s Meal, Hooked, The Bitch, Mirror, Mirror, Just Like That and othersWell, thanks, Michelle. It's nice to be appreciated!Here's a link to the book on Amazon in both print and ebook format: http://www.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_sb_ss_i_1_15?url=search-alias%3Dstripbooks&field-keywords=the+almond+tree+by+michelle+corasanti&sprefix=the+almond+tree%2Cstripbooks%2C0 Blue skies,Les"},

I'll keep you informed.This novel is the best work I've ever done and I'm extremely proud of it. I cannot wait to have a copy in my hot little hand! It'll come out as a paperback and an ebook.Please keep it in mind next spring when it's available!Blue skies,LesP.S. Here are some of the other blurbs that will appear in the novel. Also, Cort McMeel is writing the forward for it. Cort was the initial champion for it and has a lot to do with it getting into the right hands and published.Other blurbs:BLURBS FOR THE RAPIST1. Les Edgerton presents anutterly convincing anti-hero. The abnormal psychology is pitch-perfect. TheRapist ranks right up there with Camus' The Stranger and Simenon's DirtySnow. An instant modern classic.AllanGuthrie, author of Slammer andothers. Publisher, Blasted Heath Books2. So, I’m reading Les Edgerton’sThe Rapist. The title has alreadymade me uneasy.Five pages in and I can hardlybreathe.Ten and I’m nauseous.For the next 50, I’m a mixture ofall of the above, but most of all, angry.I feel like ringing my feministfriends and confessing: Sisters, I’m reading something you will kill me forreading.I feel like ringing my excolleagues - parole officers and psychologists who work with sex offenders inBarlinnie Prison, Glasgow - and asking them if they think it’s helpful topublish an honest and explicit transcript which shows the cognitive distortionsof a callous, grandiose, articulate sex offender; one which illustrates hisinability to have a relationship with a woman and his complete lack of empathy?I’m thinking I don’t know what Ishould be thinking.Will it turn sex offenders on?Should we listen to this guy?Is it possible to separate theperson from the offence, and to empathise with him as he waits to die?I don’t ring anyone. I read on.And the breathlessness, nausea,anger and confusion increase all the way to the end, at which point all I knowis that the book is genius.HelenFitzgerald, author, Dead Lovely, BloodyWomen, The Devil’s Staircase, Donor and others.3. Take a Nabokovian narratortrying to convince the reader of his innocence and filter it through AnOccurrence at Owl Creek Bridge and you've got The Rapist, a raw and frighteningjourney through the inner psyche of a damaged man.BrianLindenmuth, Publisher, SpinetinglerMagazine and Snubnose Press4. One never knows what to expectwhen reading a novel entitled “The Rapist,” yet, similar to “The Bitch” whichprecedes this, with Les Edgerton you know you're in for an interesting ride.Tackling a tough subject with great aplomb, Les Edgerton proves once again whyhe is one of the most exciting writers of this generation. The structure ofthis just astounded me. I've never read anything like it before. I've neverbeen so engrossed in a novel as I was with this one. I had no idea Edgerton hadthis literary part of his writing. I don't know of any other writers that cango from crime fiction to literary so seamlessly. Edgerton should be very proudof this novel...One of the bravest pieces offiction you are likely to read this year, and also one of the best. This is anovel you'll want to read again and again, an outstanding read!LucaVeste, author of the story collections Liverpool5, and More Liverpool Five. He isalso the editor of the story collection, Offthe Record5. The Rapist blends Camus and JimThompson in an existential crime novel that is as dark and intoxicating asstrong Irish coffee. Les Edgerton pulls us into the corkscrew mind of TrumanFerris Pinter, a twisted man with skewed perception of the world, as his lifespirals toward oblivion, like dirty dishwater down a plughole. It reminded meof Jim Thompson's Savage Night in itsdelirium.PaulD Brazill, Author, 13 Shots Of Noirand others.6. Les Edgerton’s book The Rapist is Albert Camus’ The Stranger retold as if by thelovechild of Edgar Allen Poe and Charles Bukowski. Yes, it’s disturbing, yetlayered and provocative, with its combination of mysticism and perversion. Iparticularly like the cat and mouse relationship between the protagonist Trumanand the prison warden—it’s reminiscent of TheShawshank Redemption. This tale, with its many twists and turns, isdefinitely not for the faint of heart—but then, the title should have made thatclear.ScottEvans, Editor, Blue Moon Literary and ArtReview, Author, First Folio7. William Faulkneron steroids or Hannibal Lecter on meth; neither as literate or frightening asLes Edgerton in his ground-breaking novel, The Rapist. This intellectualtour-de-force rips open the mind of a delusional psychopath taking the readeron a raw journey that challenges Dante’s Inferno. And the last line of the bookis the penultimate example of a sociopath’s naked ego.R.C. Stewart, author of TheBlackness of Darkness, No Remorseand others.8. Adeathdream swan dive from the existential stratosphere plummeting into thepersonal hell of a tormented, broken psyche, The Rapist introduces us to a gentle and philosophical misanthropenamed Truman Pinter, at once reminiscent of Albert Camus and PatriciaHighsmith, even John Gardner’s Grendeland the journal of Carl Panzram. Les Edgerton melds introspection and visceral,human brutality in this death row narrative from a masterful storyteller, whosedissection of a psychopath will haunt you long after the final page.Thomas Pluck, Well-known commentator on the noir scene, many shortstories published in magazines such as the UtneReader, Editor of the anthology, THE PROTECTOR.9. The Rapist is a disturbing look into thetwisted mind of a narcissistic psychopath on death row. A vulgar odysseyreminiscent of Nabokov’s Lolita, although far more depraved, Les Edgerton hascrafted a dark and brilliant story that leaves you as equally unsettled as itdoes in complete awe.JuliaMadeleine, author of No One To Hear You Scream and The Truth AboutScarlet Rose10. When Les Edgerton asked me toread an ARC of “The Rapist” he warned me with that title it may not be my thingand he was okay with whatever I decided. I knew of his writing books like Hooked: Write Fiction That Grabs Readers at Page One& Never Lets Them Go and Finding Your Voice: How to Put Personality in YourWriting  but never had looked at any of his fiction. Iwas prepared for something graphic but he refused to talk about the plot orstoryline. No hints. I was ready to be offended. I’m astrong advocate for women’s equality and won’t tolerate or put my name nearanything that belittles woman.  With atitle of “The Rapist” it had two and a half strikes before I read the firstline because rape is all about a man having power over a woman.From the first pages the wordsand voice made me think of American literature masters like Mark Twain andEdgar Allen Poe I was forced to read in high school. The difference was inschool I still muttered about reading dead masters and times, but grew to lovethe descriptions, plots and characters that transported me to another moment inhistory. In “The Rapist” I read greedily to see where the book was going,totally engrossed in the story. The honesty and freshness of the words from themain character kept me glued to the page to see what happened to the man caughtin the worst circumstances and an act of degradation to woman. That is aboutall I want to say about the plot. I understand Les’s reasons for not explainingthe details. You need fresh eyes to appreciate it but that isn’t to say I won’tgo back and reread it like other writing masters savoring it. It is one ofthose books that each time you read it, you find another kernel of truth, apearl of wisdom. It has that many facets wrapped in rich layers of dialogue,characterization and setting that pounded with each of the rapist’s heartbeat.I was hooked from the first page.WendyGager, author of A Case of Infatuation, ACase of Accidental Intersection, andA Case of Hometown Blues.11. LesEdgerton’s masterly The Rapist is adeeply disturbing journey into the murky recesses of the mind of psychopathicdeath row inmate Truman Ferris Pinter. An intellectual, erudite, philosophicalmisanthrope, Truman draws the reader inexorably into his fractured web. Thereare times when one nods one’s head in agreement with his well-reasonedarguments, only to shrink back in horror at the realisation. Sympathy for TheDevil, indeed, in this dark vision of a black heart that is both astoundinglyhonest and ultimately terrifying.Lesley Ann Sharrockformer publisher/editor Moondance Media,author of 7th Magpie."},

{"title": "IT WAS THE BEST OF TIMES... IT WAS (MOSTLY) THE WORST OF TIMES...", "date": "Sunday, October 14, 2012", "text": "Hifolks,SorryI haven’t posted in a bit, but I’ve been out of it since Bouchercon and havegotten dozens and dozens of emails since and thought it might make more senseif I just told you guys what’s been going on.First,I’ve been through a week of what feels like a Dickens' or Russian novel, but I’memerging fairly well.Forstarters, I went to Bouchercon last week, anticipating a magical time. Well… asit turned out, it wasn’t. It’s kind of forced me to face my own mortality.Iarrived on Thursday, checked into the airport Marriott which is about 15 milesaway from the convention center at the Renaissance Marriott. Jumped back in myrental and headed for the convention. This trip was a really big deal for me.It represented an opportunity to reconnect with mystery/suspense/thriller/noirwriters I’m friends with and meet new writers whom I’ve admired from afar. Mywife and I kind of mortgaged our Christmas and other things to pay for it and Iplanned to make some hay! Maybe even hook up with a publisher or three to lookat some of my work. You know—what us writer-types do when we go to professionalconferences. We saw it as an investment in our future.Whatdo they say? Man plans… and God laughs?Truethat.Igot to the hotel and that’s when the troubles began. MapQuest didn’t alert methat navigating downtown Cleveland is a nightmare. I finally got to a downtown Marriott and parked a block away at their underground garage. I have fairlysevere COPD and it about wore me out to hike from the garage to the hotel… onlyto run into old friend Hallie Ephron who told me the convention was at another Marriott—the Renaissance—which happened to be two blocks further away. For youyoung whippersnappers, that’s a piece of cake, but it took me the good part ofhalf an hour to hike it, having to stop several times to catch my breath andhold a mirror up to see if my breath still showed…Finally,I made it to the host hotel and went directly to…TheBar.Whereelse? It’s where the action of writer’s conferences is always at. First, I hadto register, which entailed a walk of what seemed half a mile down the hall tothe opposite end. Finally, that done, I hiked back to the bar and ordered somemeds… a Jack and water. Instantly revived!WhereI was soon embroiled in conversation with a writer who wanted to lecture meabout The Differences Between Plot-Based and Character-Based Fiction. Preciselywhy I always go to the bar and don’t attend a lot of panels which are oftenabout things like: The Differences Between Plot-Based and… you get it. After Iextricated myself from this guy, I started to see old friends and wasintroduced to new ones and everything was cool again. Made friends with thebartenders who were great. This one bartender even bought me a drink. That’swhen you know you’ve arrived.Spenta largely pleasurable evening chatting with other writers. Don’t ask me theirnames. I have to check my own nametag to remember my own. My wife usually goeswith me to serve as my memory, due to my Halfzeimer’s. Well, I remember some—EricBeetner, my old friend Jed Ayres, Johnny Shaw (whose new book I just finished andit was one of the best reads I’ve had in a long while), Tom Pluck, Josh Stallings,Christa Faust, Dominic Martell and a bunch of other terrific writers. As thecartoon guy says, the whole evening was “Happy, happy, joy, joy.” Finallyleft to go to the parking garage three blocks away and got discombobulated(lost, homey), and it took over an hour to find my car. Wondering what the cityof Cleveland had done to their oxygen supply. Finally made it back to my motel,after encountering a detour on the way and eventually figuring out how to findmy digs.Gotup the next day (Friday) and headed back to the convention center. Good day.Met lots of cool writers, saw old friends, generally had a great time. Ate somefried calamari. Some of the best I’ve ever eaten. I’ll come back to that in abit…Thatevening was our Noir @ the Bar reading at the Wonderbar. It was only two blocksaway but I couldn’t walk it so some really nice folks—Lee Thompson and SabrinaOgden were kind enough to go with me and share a cab. You know, humor the olddude… I think a guy I desperately wanted to meet as I’m a huge admirer of hiswork was there—Duane Swierczynsky—but if he was,alas, I didn’t get to meet him. The reading went well even though the mics wereterrible. I had a guy come up to me afterward and introduce himself as apublisher and he bought four of my books (thank you!) and we’d kind of madeplans to meet up the next day but as it turned out that was not to be. Sir, ifyou happen to read this, please give me a shout!From the reading, we went back to the Renaissanceand that’s when things began to go hinky. A boatload of us were gathered in thelobby just off the bar and things began hitting me. I remember asking someoneif they could find me a room I could crash in that night as I didn’t think Icould make it back to my hotel. I’d begun breaking out into cold sweats andfeeling faint. I didn’t want to come across as a wuss, so I just slouched downin a chair and eventually passed out (not from drinking, from illness). I wokeup at 3 ayem and the place was deserted. I honestly thought I might be dying.Not to be melodramatic, but that’s the way I felt. I didn’t see any way aroundit, so forced myself up and down to the parking garage and found my car anddrove back to my hotel. Somehow…Woke up at six ayem and turned over and my stomachbegan cramping big-time and I began the first of about eight ralphings.Calimari. Felt like I was dying. Food poisoning, I assumed. There was no way Icould return to the convention. I called and asked for a late checkout and thenspent two hours between the porcelain goddess and packing and finally piled inmy car and began the three-and-a-half hour drive back to Ft. Wayne. Pure hellall the way.Got there, found out I’d had a hemorrhoid burst andabout a cup of blood lost. Went to bed and got up the next morning and therewas more bright red blood. Either a second ‘roid or the last gasps of the firstone. Mary took me to the ER and we got there at 11:30 and they took a bunch oftests as they thought maybe it wasn’t food poisoning but gallbladder—in fact, I’demailed novelist John Gilstrap to tell him why I’d left so abruptly and hesuggested it might not be food poisoning but gallbladder—John, looks like youmight be right—awaiting test results. Sat in the ER room until 7:30 that nightand they finally released us. They talked about doing something called a “hemorrhoidectomy”and then decided against it for the time being. Ended up the next several daystraipsing from doctor’s offices to hospitals to labs, et al. Tested for pancreas,lumbar (another story), gall bladder and other things. Oh, forgot—on the wayhome from Cleveland got a severe sore throat and cough and mentioned it at theER but there was so many other things they forgot it. Gave me a breathingtreatment for my COPD and put me on two different inhalers and all kinds ofother crap. Two days later, went to RediMed as I was coughing nonstop and theydiagnosed acute bronchitis and possible pneumonia and gave me meds for that.And then, just as life was looking kind of gray… it went positively black. Marytook our only car in as the idiot light went on and the news was that theengine’s shot. They said all we could do is drive it till it dropped—nothing couldbe done. So, that’s where we are with the car. If it goes we don’t have moneyfor a new engine or for a new used car, so just hope our shoe leather holds up.That brings us to yesterday. My strength and energywere starting to return which was good as I had an engagement to speak to theIndiana Romance Writers in Indy. Rented a car, drove down, and had a reallygood visit with those delightful folks. Felt re-energized.Anyway, that was my week, right out of Dickens or Tolstoy.Not looking for sympathy—well, maybe a little—but it’s just easier to post thishere than to reply to all the individual emails that have been coming in. Iappreciate each and every one of those, btw—it’s just going to be impossible toreply to them quickly so hope y’all understand. And I wanted those folks atBouchercon who I was going to meet with know why I wasn’t able to.The good news? And, yes there is some. My studentsin both my online creative writing class and the Skype class I co-teach withJenny Milchman for the New York Writer’s Workshop. Every single one of them hasbeen extremely understanding and gracious. They’ve allowed me an extra week toget it together and they’ll never know how much I appreciate that. It means theworld to me and I won’t forget.Anyway, the one thing I’ve learned in my journey isthat life is cyclic. It’s not up forever and it’s not down forever. I’m prettysure something really cool and good is going to happen soon. I mean… I’m not justwhistling past the graveyard here am I?Thanks for all of your well-wishes and thoughts.Here’s something remarkable. Stuff like this shows a person the true value offriends. A good friend of mine—Bob (I won’t embarrass you by giving your lastname, Bob) has far worse things going on in his life than I do—his beloved wifeis dying right now and may even be gone at this moment)—Bob has truly seriousthings on his plate, and yet, he took the time out to call me and voice hissupport for me. Now… who does that? Only a truly selfless person. Thanks, Bob.People like Bob keep reminding me of that great philosopher Red Green and whathe always says:Keep your stick on the ice. I’m pulling for ya. We’reall in this together.Yes we are.Blue skies,Les"},

{"title": "Publishers and some of the horses they rode in on...", "date": "Tuesday, October 2, 2012", "text": "Hifolks,Justsome things on my mind that keep me awake at night…AsI’ve been doing this writing and publishing thing for a long time, I’ve beenfortunate enough to make some friends who have access to the powers-that-be inpublishing. From those folks, I’ve learned things that aren’t taught in MFAprograms or how-to books or at writing conventions. And much of what I learndisturbs me. Actually… it doesn’t disturb me—it flat-out pisses me off.WhenI was a kid, all I ever wanted to be was a writer. I deemed it the mosthonorable of all professions. Good books—I was taught—were the source ofknowledge and of truth. It was that truth thing that really attracted me. I wasborn into one of those dysfunctional families most of us writer-types seem tocome from—one of those families in which truth was somewhat deficit from in ourdaily dealings with each other. For instance, I was abused in a variety of waysby a religious fanatic of a mother and by a father who abused me in anothervariety of ways. Not trying to make a victim’s case here—just laying out theway it was. It was about a year ago that I finally discovered that my fatherwasn’t going to show up in my DNA. After 68 years, I finally learned the truth about the man. It wasn’tthat my mother suddenly felt the urge to confess. Nope. I learned the truthfrom having a DNA test done with myself and one of my sisters. Last I heard, mymother was still rewriting the story she laid on me…Anyway,the truth has always been my standard. Why I became a writer. Why I hada personal agenda to always tell the truth in my fiction, no matter how itmight make me look to others. A long time ago, I came upon a piece of wisdomthat I’ve always believed—that the greatest of writers are those who arewilling to go deep inside themselves and expose that part of us that mostpeople try to keep hidden. That place where real truth resides.I’msaying all this in preface to what’s keeping me up at night. For years, itseems, I’ve been more than a bit naïve. I’ve simply taken it on faith thatpublishers had the same impetus as I have—to search for truth and present it to the world. A noble thing,both for editors and publishers and writers.And,I was wrong. Or, maybe I was right at one time but things have changed a lot inour culture.Aclose friend of mine who is close to the decision-makers in publishing recentlytold me a couple of very disturbing things. It was concerning a book of mine,THE BITCH. I consider it the best thing I’ve ever written and I’ve beenextremely gratified that a whole boatload of people I admire and respect—fellowwriters—quality writers—have agreed with my own opinion and have been graciousenough to say so in public. I wanted desperately to see it in print, but alas,so far have been unable to attract a print publisher. It is in ebook form and I’mgrateful for that. At least it’s out there for folks to read.But,what’s disturbing me is that my aforementioned friend had earlier championed itamong print publishers. What he told me is what keeps me up at night. Twoinstances.Oneconcerns a publisher of crime novels who agreed with my friend that the bookwas, indeed “brilliant,” but passed on it saying “it had too many elements thatcould be considered politicallyincorrect. (italics mine). Excuse me… but what the fuck? A publisher whoeven considers if writing is or isn’t politically correct? This isn’t apublisher at all, in my opinion. This is a bookseller who wants to be seen as apublisher. Probably wears those jackets with leather patches on the sleeves andhangs out in writerly bars in Gotham City. But, a guy who proclaims himself apublisher and won’t publish something because it’s “politically incorrect?”Excuse me, but when I was in the joint we had a name for folks like this. Thename was… punk. I understand all about protecting one’s livelihood, but we’retalking about a publisher, not a life insurance salesman. (Nothing againstinsurance salesmen!). This is what I always assumed publishing was all about.Putting out books that spoke the truth, no matter how inconvenient. And, truthis more often than not inconvenient.Thisguy’s attitude just pisses me off. What really irritates me is that he isn’texposed for the poser he is. Most writers aren’t aware of his attitude. I reallywish I could name him and call him out, but the lawyers on my block tell methat isn’t a wise move.Theother person that keeps me tossing and turning is the guy who was the editor ofa Legacy 6 publisher. Who told our mutual friend that he’d love to publish THEBITCH, but he couldn’t because his boss told him that if he signed any bookthat earned a dime less than $30,000 he’d be fired. Not chewed out or had hischarge card suspended for a week or banished to the office without the window,but fired. So his “brave new imprint” that was going to publish “new,original and exciting talent” couldn’t for fear of loss of his corner officeand he thereafter only considered brand names. Instead of finding that new orunknown talent he proclaimed to the world was his intent, his days consisted mostlyof trying to snatch brand name writers away from other houses. The more Italked to others in the industry, the more I discovered that this was becominga standard for an awful lot of publishers. This guy, like the first guy, showedhis own level of courage. Which was tied to his wallet. I understand this inmany trades and professions but always thought publishers and editors lookedupon what they did as a “calling.” Turns out it’s about as much of a calling aswearing an animal costume down at the fast food restaurant for minimum wage.(Nothing against the folks who wear animal costumes—they’re very honest aboutdoing it for the bread only.)Whatthese guys don’t realize is that this kind of attitude is what is going to betheir downfall. They’re becoming punks in jailhouse vernacular. And, their fatewill be the same. It’s their current mindset and publishing policies that willspell their eventual doom. For what’s happening is that there are publishers out there who do believein truth and who do believe in writers who are courageous and who arethemselves courageous in the books they publish.Rightnow, they’re small. But, they’re growing. Publishers like Snubnose Press, NewPulp Press, Bare Knuckles Press, StoneGate Ink and several others. I’m sorry toomit listing them all and apologize for that omission. They’re growing andthere’s a reason. They’re not afraid to publish something that might becontroversial.Printpublishers think they’re losing sales due to the cheaper costs associated withebooks. That’s a part of it, but another reason is that readers also want qualityfor their purchases and don’t find enough originality in the same old booksthey’ve had available before. There are just some new and exciting things outthere and it’s the new guys on the block who are providing it.Writingthat appeals to everyone isn’t writing. It’s typing. If a book doesn’t piss offat least some readers, I maintain it isn’t worth much. It’s Pravda.There.That’s my rant. I feel better now.Ihope you’ll consider buying a copy of THE BITCH. If it somehow becomes such aseller that a print publisher wants it, I’d love that, but I’ll also tell youthat I won’t let it go to one of the kinds of publishers described above.Here’swhat some of those respected writers had to say about it:THE BITCH is the kind of rawcrime fiction that's right up my alley, like sandpaper for the brain. Edgertonhas got the chops. Mad chops. Gonna make us all ashamed of our puny efforts oneday.--Anthony Neil Smith, bestselling author of Choke on Your Lies, Psychomatic, Hogdoggin’,Yellow Medicine, The Drummer, To the Devil, My Regards, Devil Red (Hap andLeonard) and others.The Bitch is a viciousbarnstormer of a novel, a noir rollercoaster that won't let you unbuckle untilthat final three-word smackdown. Les Edgerton is Eddie Bunker's pulpy cousinand Eugene Izzi's soul brother, and with a spiritual family like that, youcan't go wrong. Pick it up immediately.--Ray Banks, internationally bestsellingauthor of Dead Money, Beast of Burden, TheBig Blind. Saturday’s Child, Donkey Punch, No More Heroes and others.Les Edgertondoesn’t pussyfoot around. He writes about real people drowning in desperationin THE BITCH. He’s got a story to tell you so get ready; it’s coming at youfast. Get ready…              —Linwood Barclay, internationalbestselling author of Never Look Away,Clouded Vision, The Last Resort, Fear theWorst, Too Close to Home, No Time for Goodbye, The Accident and others.Les Edgerton’sbrilliantly hardboiled THE BITCH is the tense and hard hitting story of JakeBishop, a reformed ex-con whose dark past drags him back into a life of crimelike an umbilical cord tied tight around his neck. —Paul D. Brazill, author of 13Shots of Noir.I liked THE BITCHso much that I wanted to publish it. But we lost out and Bare Knuckles Pressgot a hell of a book. The Bitch is a dark crime fiction story that never oncepulls a punch or ducks behind some bullshit like “happy endings” or “closure.”The Bitch isn't afraid to stay dark until the very end. —Brian Lindenmuth, editor/publisher ofSnubnose Press and Spinetingler Magazine.From its openingsentence to its last, THE BITCH is an engrossing journey into some very darkplaces. Les Edgerton writes like a poet with a mean streak, and his prose goesdown easy and smooth like good liquor as it carves up your insides. —Henry Perez, author of Mourn the Living and Killing Red.Imagine, if youwill, Les Edgerton, Dashiell Hammett and Raymond Chandler sipping straightwhiskey while swapping lies in the back booth of the Linebacker bar as the“noir” legends welcome Edgerton into the brotherhood of broken dreams. With THEBITCH, Edgerton earns his way into this special literary brotherhood. No, TheBitch isn’t a wild woman, but prison slang for “ha-BITCH-ual criminal.” This isa taut tale of double-cross, death, diamonds and destruction as Jake Bishopfights to protect all he holds dear—his freedom, his pregnant wife, and histeen-age brother -- by holding The Bitch at bay when trapped into one last job.Sam Spade and Phillip Marlowe could learn a thing or two from thishairdresser.—Bob Stewart, authorof Remorse (Pinnacle) a True CrimeBook of the Month selection, Hidden Evil,and others.Les Edgerton. Ijust read his newest hard-boiled effort, THE BITCH, and I realized I didn'tonce breathe through the entire thing. Okay, that's an exaggeration, but it isone of the most fun, dangerous, if not pyromanic literary performances of thepast year (word up is that parts of it are taken from Les's own life. Holycrap, this guy shouldn't be alive!). Like Les's previous bestselling nonfictioneffort on writing, HOOKED, this novel is a sure bet.—Vincent Zandri author of TheRemains, The Innocent, Moonlight Falls and The Concrete Pearl. THE BITCH issuperb. Edgerton’s hard, pitch-perfect prose and relentless plot provide aone-two knockout punch of crime novel perfection...the real bitch of THE BITCHis that I tried to buy this priceless work and publish it under a new imprintand I couldn't afford the damn thing. Now it’s gold in someone else's pocket.—Cortright McMeel, author of Short (St. Martin’s Press), foundingeditor and publisher of MurdalandMagazine: Crime Fiction for the 21st Century and  Noir Nation: International Journal of CrimeFiction.Every crimenovelist remembers how his breath was literally taken away when he firststarted to read the early novels of Elmore Leonard. Les Edgerton has used thetime he served in prison well. Years from now many future crime writers willalso remember discovering him. His first crime novel, -but not his firstpublished book THE BITCH is a realistic crime noir kind of novel that remindsme of Unknown Man 89, La Brava, Stick, and The Killer Inside Me (Jim Thompson).—Joseph Trigoboff, author of The Bone Orchard and The Shooting Gallery.Theseguys’ opinions mean something to me. The guy who’s afraid to publish a bookthat may be “politically incorrect?” Not so much…Thanksfor listening to my rant! I’d be interested in other writer’s stories abouttheir publishing experiences. Now I can maybe get some sleep tonight and rest up for the forthcoming Bouchercon.Blueskies,LesTo order: US http://www.amazon.com/The-Bitch-ebook/dp/B006P2NLHG/ref=sr_1_3_title_0_main?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1349201423&sr=1-3&keywords=les+edgerton  UK  http://www.amazon.co.uk/The-Bitch-ebook/dp/B006P2NLHG/ref=sr_1_5?s=digital-text&ie=UTF8&qid=1349201484&sr=1-5"},

{"title": "Michelle Cohen Corasanti's book is out!", "date": "Saturday, September 15, 2012", "text": "Hi folks,Just got notice that one of the writersI coach on their novels just had the book I worked with her on come out. MichelleCohen Corasanti was nice enough to send me the essay her publisher—Garnet Publishing,a UK publisher—asked her to write for their website and Michelle gave mepermission to post it here. In it, she relates her journey to publication and Ithink the writers here will find it very interesting. I’m delighted to reportthat I also helped her secure her agent. After playing a bit of a role in hersuccess, I was delighted she didn’t forget the “little people” like moi.Without further ado, here’s whatMichelle had to say:WHY DID I WRITE THE ALMONDTREE?I never wanted to be a writer. Well, youmight wonder, then why did I you write a novel? All I can say is that Iwitnessed something, over twenty years ago, that affected me so deeply thatdespite all my best efforts, I could no longer repress it. I remember the exactmoment it happened. I had just started reading Khaleed Hosseni’s book, The KiteRunner. I was lying on a lounge chair, by the pool, at the Setai hotel, inSouth Beach, sipping a cosmopolitan. I was on vacation with my husband andtwins. I didn’t have a care in the world until Amir, the protagonist, said thatthe past can’t be buried, that it finds the means to claw its way out.  And like Amir, my past found a way to callme. And there I was face-to-face with my worst nightmares and my greatestfailures. One might say a defining moment. And I decided, that I wanted mychildren to know, that I had seen injustice and I that I would try to dosomething about it.  And so I wrote thestory that had been inside of me for so long.WHAT IS MY FAMILY BACKGROUND?I grew up in a Jewish home in whichGerman cars were boycotted and Israeli bonds were plentiful. Other than theblue-and-white tin Jewish National Fund sedakah box my family kept in thekitchen and the money we would give to plant trees in Israel, all I knew wasthat after the Holocaust, the Jews found a land without a people for a peoplewithout a land. I went to public school until thirdgrade and then attended the Hillel Yeshiva. There were two students in my sixthgrade graduating class. I returned to public school for seventh grade, stoppedwearing skirts with pants underneath and re-befriended my former best-friendwhom I had lost touch with during my yeshiva years.  Her father had since died, her mother turnedinto a raging alcoholic and her older brothers spent most of their time intheir bedrooms listening to Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds in a state I stillwas too young to recognize. She lived without rules as she had no supervision.Just what every teenage girl wants and what every parent doesn’t.  Being the oldest and the only daughterin the family, my parents' strictness suffocated me. I decided I wanted tostudy abroad in Paris in order to get distance from myparental-choke-hold.  My Zionist parentsrejected that idea and sent me to Israel to study Judaism and Hebrew with theRabbi’s perfectly well-behaved and obedient daughter Miriam. I wassixteen-years-old and the year was 1982. WHAT WAS MY INITIAL EXPERIENCEIN ISRAEL LIKE?Despite having come from Utica, NewYork, the transition to the Ben Shemen Boarding School was effortless. Isoon had an Israeli boyfriend. When he told me he was a Kahanist, I had no ideawhat he was talking about. “I believe in transfer,” he told me. “There are 21Arab countries, the Palestinians must choose one of them. We don’t want them inthis country.” And who was I to question him? I thought Palestinian was asynonym for Israeli. I had been taught, after all, that Israel was a landwithout a people. I had never met a Palestinian. As it turned out, my socializing helpedadvance my Hebrew more than the flash cards Miriam was constantly reviewing inour room. I had become a top student. Of course I decided to stay.When I graduated from high school, I enrolledin the preparatory program at the Rothberg International School to improve myHebrew in order to attend the Hebrew University of Jerusalem. My boyfriend wasunhappy. “There are too many Arabs in Jerusalem.” He was in the military bythen and would come to visit me with his loaded M-16, as required by law.My parents, in an attempt to break-up myrelationship with the Kahanist, sent me to Paris for the summer to studyFrench. There I met a girl from Beverly Hills and we spent most of our nightsin exclusive clubs filled with rich, educated Lebanese men.  Those were the first Arabs I had ever met. Theyhad quite a different version of Israel than the one I had learned. With myeyes opened, I returned to Israel.WHEN DID MY OPINION ABOUTISRAEL CHANGE?I returned to Israel, dropped theKahanist, and enrolled in the Middle Eastern studies program at the HebrewUniversity. I was the only American in my department. The rest of the students wereIsraeli Jews and “Arab Israelis.” After my experience in Paris, I befriendedthe latter, but they were nothing like the elite Lebanese I had met. They werepoor, second-class citizens and I had to hide my friendship with them out offear I might be failed-out—a very real fear, I might add.At the start, I was the only one in thedepartment who didn’t know who Mohammad was. Come to find out, both the “ArabIsraelis” and I had no knowledge of the version of Islam and Middle EasternHistory that was being taught at my department. It was forbidden to writePalestine because it never existed. Before 1948 there was the empty land ofIsrael and afterwards there was Israel. It is true what they say that historyis written by the victors.  I was quicklylearning another history from my “Arab-Israeli” friends. Plus, I witnessedfirst-hand how they were treated. When I told my parents, they refused tobelieve me. My parents, who are liberal democrats, who were the first tosupport Martin Luther King Jr. and all of the civil rights legislation thatfollowed his marches and were opposed to the Apartheid in South Africa ,didn’twant to hear and refused to believe what I was saying.  In fact, none of the American Jews I knew believedor wanted to hear what I was saying. I had never witnessed such racism anddiscrimination in my life. In fact, I was mystified to observe how the samegroup of people could be vehemently opposed to oppression and racism of blacksin the US and around the world, could support a similar form of discriminationand oppression of Palestinians. It was then that I realized how I differed fromthe other American Jews I knew. The lessons I learned from the Holocaust werethat we can never be bystanders to human suffering whether it be Jewish ornon-Jewish. The lessons the other Jews learned was the Berlin Wall. We can onlyrely on ourselves. We must do whatever it takes so that we can have an as closeto an ethno-religiously pure Jewish country as we can in case it’s needed andwe will achieve that goal regardless of what we have to do to the non-Jewishnatives. I felt like I was pitted against the rest. At that time, I didn’t knowanyone else who took my position. I had never heard of Amira Hass or Ilan Pappeat that point in my life. The last year I was there, the intifadabroke out. Things went from horrible to unbearable. Something needed to be doneand I was determined to help bring it about.WHAT WERE MY PLANS TO HELPBRING ABOUT A JUST PEACE BETWEEN THE PALESTINIANS AND THE ISRAELIS?I returned to the United States topursue my master’s degree in Middle Eastern Studies at Harvard. I wasdetermined to devote myself to achieving a just peace in the Middle East anddefending the oppressed. I devoted my every breath to that goal. While atHarvard, I won a Foreign Language & Area Studies fellowship to pursueArabic at Middlebury College’s summer total immersion program. As I had alreadystudied Arabic for four years, I entered at the advanced level. When I finished the program, I went witha classmate to Walden Pond and we were speaking in Modern Standard Arabic whenthree Arabs approached us. One spoke to me in colloquial Palestinian. He, whoI’ll call Hasan, told me I spoke like Nagib Mahfouz, the Egyptian NobelLaureate. Hasan had completed his PhD in ChemicalPhysics at the Hebrew University and was doing his post-doctorate with a NobelPrize winner at Harvard. We knew the same people, had lived in the same dormand had the same birthday. I learned his father had gone to prison when he wasyoung and wasn’t released until Hasan was in graduate school. Hasan’s fatherhad helped a refugee bury arms. Hasan, being the oldest son of nine childrenwith an illiterate mother, had to work to support his family from a very youngage. Due to circumstances, Hasan was only able to attend school on occasion.But because he was brilliant in math and science, he didn’t need more. Heeventually won a scholarship to the university. There, the Israelis recognizedhis genius and embraced him. He grew up in a mud brick one room house. Theydidn’t get electricity until he left for college. I was going to make up foreverything he had suffered.HOW DID IT HAPPEN THAT INSTEADOF MAKING HASSAN’S DREAMS COME TRUE, I BECAME HIS WORST NIGHTMARE?I graduated from the master’s program atHarvard and started law school (I was going to be an international human rightslawyer) and my PhD at Harvard at the same time. The Middle Eastern studiesprogram had been easy for me, but law school was a different story. I shouldhave read Scott Turow’s One L before I started. I was studying twenty hours aday. I never went out while Hasan tried to find a professorship.  Since I spoke to him in Arabic, I hadn’trealized that his English was practically non-existent and so I had to spendmany evenings translating and listening to his lectures in ChemicalPhysics.  When I met Hasan I didn’t realize thatgetting an academic position would be harder than achieving peace in the MiddleEast, with up to a thousand top candidates applying for the seven or eightpositions that opened up each year. I told him it was fine for his mentor, aNobel Prize winner, to take risks, but he was at the start of his career.Little did I know that he was at the forefront of nanotechnology. With thepressure from my studies and his job search I crumbled.I decided to do an internship my lastsemester in law school with my father’s law firm in my hometown. There, I metmy husband who had recently returned home from Los Angeles and never lookedback. I had wanted to save the Palestinians and in the end I only saved myself.HOW DID I FIND MY WAY TO BEGOOD AGAIN?The Kite Runner forced me to deal withmy past, but it also gave me a way to be good again.  I realized that when I read the passage abouthow history and religion weren’t easy to overcome and in the end Amir was aPashtun and Hasan a Hazara— I knew I was finally ready to tell the story thathad been inside me for twenty years. I would show how such obstacles betweenIsraelis and Palestinians could be transcended for I had seen it with my owneyes. For five years, while my friendsshopped, I slaved over this novel because I had found a different way toachieve my dream. While a human rights lawyer can save a few, a writer canreach into the hearts of many and affect them forever. Even if I make a ripple,I will have succeeded. This story is fiction and the charactersare straight from my imagination, but it has a sound and accurate base inreality.May the battleswe fight be for the advancement of the human race. HOW DOES A NON-WRITER WRITE ASTORY?Well, I told myself, if a medical doctorcould write The Kite Runner, then surely you could write a novel as well. Afterall, weren’t lawyers trained to write? I knew I had the seed for a story, butthat was all. I decided that I would completely fictionalized the story. I choseto write about a boy that was born in 1948 and grew up under Israeli military rulewhich had similar laws to the ones used in the occupied territories today.In my first draft, I wrote about how thePalestinian boy, Ichmad, helped a refugee bury arms and his father insisted onpaying the price. His only request was that Ichmad forget about politics andmake something out of his life. I then wrote about how an Israeli professorrecognized Ichmad’s ability and together they achieved something great. And, ofcourse, Ichmad falls for the perfect Jewish American human rights activist onthe planet.I wrote it in essay form. No dialogue.No hooks. No cliff hangers. No rise and fall of tension. Completely flatcharacters. I knew I needed help. I rarely ever read fiction and had no ideahow to turn this into a story. I began to take courses at Writers’ Digestonline.  Two years and twenty-one courseslater, my novel was still in rough shape. WHY WOULD A JEWISH AMERICANWOMAN CHOSE TO WRITE IN THE VOICE OF A PALESTINIAN MUSLIM MALE?I began to write my story in firstperson in the voice of Ichmad because it felt natural. Yes, I know that it issomewhat strange that a Jewish American woman felt most comfortable writing inthe voice of a Palestinian Muslim. Believe it or not, out of all the charactersI created, I felt he was the easiest for me to be. I think that’s because I sawthe situation through the experiences and eyes of mainly Palestinian Muslim males.I felt their pain. Ironically, my Hasan rarely ever talked about his past.Almost all the stories I heard were from men that went to school with me orevents I witnessed myself. I didn’t meet Hasan and then become interested inthe Palestinian plight. Quite the contrary, I was deeply affected by thesituation when I met him and had already seen too much not to have my ownopinions.Surprisingly, the most difficultcharacter for me to write was Nora, the Jewish American human rights activist.Maybe that was because I had never met any. Maybe it was because I had failedso completely at that task, abandoning the cause before I even started. When Iinitially wrote the story, Nora was a much bigger part of it. I think,subconsciously and with the help of hindsight, I tried to make her intoeverything I wished I could have been. No one who read the earliest drafts ofmy book (No joke I think there were over 500) liked her. She had no flaws.Readers like characters with flaws. I found it virtually impossible to get intoher head. I eventually had to limit her role and then kill her off.  HOW DID I CHOOSE THEBEGINNING?When I initially wrote the novel, Ibegan with Ichmad on a bus to visit his father in prison. Ichmad had already helpedthe refugee bury arms and he was on his way to confess his crime to his father.During one of the writing courses I took, another student asked why should hesympathize with Ichmad? He was helping bury weapons to kill Jews. I began tore-evaluate the beginning. I definitely didn’t want to start out with aPalestinian doing what Palestinians are believed to do. I wanted to start withan innocent boy and show why he’d help the refugee.I signed up for Les Edgerton’s class,Hooked, how to write the first five pages. All we focused on in the book wasthe first five pages. I explained to Les the situation and decided to rewrite thebeginning of my novel. Seven-year-old Ichmad discovers his little sister is notin her room. She had run outside into the devil’s field and was blown up by anIsraeli planted land mine.  I got thatidea from my excellent Jewish editor Pamela Lane (more on her later). Les washarsher than any other teacher was with my work. He ripped it apart. When thecourse was over, I immediately tried to hire him to edit my book. I wasn’tlooking for someone to pat me on the back. I had a crucial message to get out. Unbeknownstto me, Les was an ardent supporter of Israel. Notice I stressed the was. I willlet his blurb tell his side of the story. I’d like to add that Les was anamazing editor and he really helped this book become a reality.WHAT DID LES EDGERTON, MYEDITOR, HAVE TO SAY ABOUT MY BOOK?Blurb forMichelle Cohen’sThe Almond Treefrom Les EdgertonMany months ago, MichelleCohen-Corasanti enrolled in one of my Writer’s Digest creative writing courseson story beginnings. The novel she worked on in class was The Almond Tree. Itwas clear immediately that this was a writer of uncommon talent and promise.The problem—for me—was her subject material. She was writing what seemed to bea pro-Palestinian book. All my life, I’ve been pro-Israeli. A political stand derivedfrom my upbringing in a fundamentalist Christian home, where we were taught froman early age that the Jewish people were God’s “chosen people,” and Israel, aGod-favored state. I was taught (and firmly believed) that as long as the U.S.was an ally of Israel, that we were also a nation under the grace of God. Apro-Palestinian novel simply went against all of my core beliefs. But, Iconsider myself a professional and I also fervently believe in freedom ofexpression. So, while I disagreed with the theme of her novel, she was neveraware of my personal beliefs which I never revealed and I simply worked withher in addressing her craft. And then… she asked if she could hire me afterclass to coach her on her final rewrite. Now, I had a moral quandary. Could I,in good conscience, help someone in a work that was fundamentally opposed toeverything I believe in? I asked several Jewish friends for their advice. I gotdiffering views. Some said, I shouldn’t lend my name and whatever editing expertiseI had to the project if I disagreed with the politics. That wasn’t censorship,they argued, and I agreed. Others said that this was a professional matter andthat my personal politics and beliefs shouldn’t be the deciding factors. Aftermuch soul-searching, I agreed with the latter. At no time during the processdid Michelle know of my beliefs. I pride myself that I’ve never revealed to anyof my students or writing clients my personal and political views nor let thoseviews influence the way I worked with them. The few who’ve learned of them havealways been surprised, assuming I shared their own views. I’m proud of the factthat I’ve remained neutral when working with writers.We began to work together. At no timeduring this process was Michelle aware of how I felt about Palestinians andIsrael. My only guide was to always treat her material in a professional wayand only look at it with the goal of helping her make it the best novel she wascapable of writing. It was only when she had finished, that I revealed my personalfeelings about Israel and Palestine to her. And that her novel had changed mymind…What’s important about this lengthy preamble to what I have to say aboutMichelle Cohen and her novel, The Almond Tree, is that this novel—the intenselygripping story of a Palestinian boy and his family and their suffering underIsraeli occupation—convinced me with surety that my beliefs about this conflictwere severely flawed and had been formed from a one-sided awareness. Her truly beautifulnovel showed clearly that there are always two sides to a question, something I’dforgotten. In other words, Michelle wrote a novel which changed my mind aboutsomething important. That is the mark of a great work of art.It was easy to see Michelle hastalent—what convinced me that this will be a book that will achieve substantialsales and be nominated for prestigious awards—was that the story she created convertedme from what I had assumed to be a committed and unyielding position to one inwhich I now see the Palestinian people as belonging to the community of mankindevery bit as much as any other group, including the Israelis.Some will be tempted to compare TheAlmond Tree to The Kite Runner, but to do so unfairly places the two books in somesort of presumed ranking. Both of these books are brilliant and powerful accountsand deserve to stand tall on their own merits, irrespective of the other.Ichmad’s story is a big-hearted story ofa small Palestinian boy who learns to survive in a brutal environment anddoesn’t simply endure, but emerges from the fire with the wisdom gleaned fromthe example of a father who has taught him that all men have value, even their enemies.A tale of innocence moving through a vicious world, compassion learned againstan environment of daily horrors, and wisdom forged through a boy’s journeythrough a life we would never wish upon our own children. Michelle Cohen’s TheAlmond Tree is one of those rarest of books—a fiction that rings withauthenticity and integrity to reveal the wonder of what it really is to behuman.If ever peace is to become a realitybetween Israel and Palestine, it will be because of the influence of books suchas this. I am proud to have been allowed by Michelle Cohen to have played a verytiny role in the development of this novel. This is a book that I think willendure and resonate forever in the souls of all who read it. I know it will inmine. Some books have the power to change us profoundly; this is one of thosebooks.Les EdgertonAuthor of The Death of Tarpons, Monday’sMeal, Hooked and others.WAS LES YOUR ONLY EDITOR WITHPOSSIBLY PRECONCIEVED VIEWS ON THE ISRAELI-PALESTINIAN SITUATION?Through the Gotham Writers’ Workshop,  I was assigned the successful novelist Marcy Dermanskyto be my writing coach.  I was leery whenI found out that Marcy was Jewish. All the Jews I knew had the Berlin Wallmentality. I knew my novel was pro-peace, but I wasn’t sure she’d see it thatway.  My novel was about a Palestinianand an Israel who are able to rise above race and religion, find a commonground and achieve what others only dream of. My message was clear, we need towork together to advance humanity.  Iknew that in my story, the Israelis gave Ichmad a scholarship, put aside theirdifferences and embraced him, but I didn’t sugar-coat Ichmad’s suffering.Reality is reality after all. Marcy was editing my novel during thetime of either the war or the siege on Gaza (the novel writing did last yearsafter all and between the classes and the editors, it all seems to have blurredtogether). She suggested I incorporate Gaza into my novel. I was skeptical. Unlikethe rest of the material,  I’d never beento Gaza. I immersed myself in relentless research about Gaza which probably wasn’tthe best thing for me. I was horrified at my findings, but Marcy helped me giveshape to my ideas.  When I finally finishedthe final draft of my novel, a couple years later, I sent it to Marcy to readand she had the following to say:Prepareyourself: The Almond Tree may very well move you to tears. Michelle Corsanti'sprofound and finely crafted debut novel tells the story of one man, IchmadHamid, from his humble beginnings as a scared and helpless child in an occupiedvillage through to his inspirational rise to power and influence. His intimatetale of love and loss and awareness shines a greater understanding of thepersonal toll of the ongoing Israeli–Palestinian conflict.-- Marcy Dermansky,author of Bad MarieAfter Marcy, the talented Pamela Lane,another Jewish editor, helped take my novel to the next level and along theway, she told me that I changed the way she viewed the conflict. She could nowsee both sides. She even wrote letters of protest against the Israeli attack onthe Gaza flotilla.   WHY ARE SOME REVIEWERSDESCRIBING YOUR NOVEL AS THE STORY ABOUT TWO BROTHERS?My intention was to write a book aboutan Israel and a Palestinian who rise above religion, race and politics andtogether achieve greatness. Somewhere along the way, the story began to take ona life of its own and all I could do was to go with it. Nora’s role shrunk andAbbas’ grew. For whatever reason, I was able to get into his head and becomehim. Abbas began as Ichmad’s younger brother who an Israeli cripples. When Idecided to add Gaza, I need to find a way to get Ichmad to Gaza. And so angryAbbas goes underground only to emerge in Gaza as a Hamas leader.   Nathan Stock, an advisor on Palestine atthe Carter Center, really helped me with all the details about Gaza. Hesuggested that I make Abbas more charismatic. And so I did. Abbas became theangry brother filled with hatred while Ichmad’s ability to forgive allows himto succeed. In the end, both brothers reach a common ground. And somehow, alongthe way, the focus of my book, for some readers, became less on ProfessorSharon and Ichmad and more about two brothers.MichelleAnd there youhave it. It’s a remarkable novel and I think it’s going to win some prestigiousliterary prizes and acclaim. You can order your copy from Amazon here  http://www.amazon.com/dp/B008XM0AZMBlue skies,Les"},

{"title": "NEW BOOK COMING SOON!", "date": "Sunday, September 2, 2012", "text": "Hifolks,I’vegot a new novel coming out shortly from StoneGate Ink both as an ebook and as apaperback, and it may be a surprise to some of y’all as it’s in a genre I haven’tpublished before. It’s a YA.And,it’s clean. No cursing, no vampires, no explicit sex. I wrote it at a time when thosethings weren’t around. Well, I guess sex was around, but not like it is today.At least not the “in your face” variety we seem to encounter these days forkids’ books.Thatmay doom it… or it may not. We’ll see.Iwrote MIRROR, MIRROR without any view to getting it published. I just wrote itfor my daughter Britney who was nine at the time. Just a labor of love. Iwanted to give her something I thought she’d enjoy. And, she did.Atthe time, I briefly considered trying to get it published and sent out the mssto two publishers, Scholastic and Hyperion. Hyperion had just started up, whichtells you how long ago it was! I was new to publishing then, even though I hada few books out, but didn’t really understand the industry well as evidenced bywhat happened next.Igot back lengthy letters from the chief editors at both places. One was fivepages long and the other, eight. Single-spaced and typed. That also tells how long ago this was... One wanted me to change the title as they hadone in the hopper with the same title. The other wanted me to recast it inthird person (it was--and still is--in first). She also sent me five of their paperbacks toread so I’d know their “style.” Now, I know this is hard to believe—especially today,when there’s so much knowledge about publishing—but I didn’t see either ofthese responses as a “yes,” but rather, as really nice rejections. I put ‘emboth in the proverbial drawer, along with the manuscript, and forgot aboutthem.Kindof dumb, wasn’t it!Guilty…Itsaw there for a long time, and then my daughter Britney and I were talking oneday about stuff, and suddenly, out of the blue, she said, “Dad, you rememberthat book you wrote for me when I was a kid? Mirror, Mirror?” Well, yes, I said. “Well,” shesaid, “it was four years before I could look into a mirror for longer than tenseconds at a time. It scared the crap out of me!”Whenshe said that, it dawned on me that perhaps it really was publishable. Britneywas (and is) a really smart person and from the time she was five readvoraciously. If she found it scary, then I figured it really might have somelegs.And,that’s when I hooked up with Aaron Patterson, the publisher of StoneGate Inkand he agreed.That’sits little history. When Britney’s little sister, Sienna, came along, I had herread it at about the same age Britney was when she first read it and herreaction was pretty much the same as Britney’s. Scared the crap out of her.I’lllet you folks who pick it up be the judge. Look for it—it’s coming out prettysoon and I’ll be sure to announce it here.Hopeit keeps kids up at night and makes ‘em avoid mirrors…Spoiler:No vampires, no zombies, no explicit sex, no cursing.Here's the synopsis of MIRROR, MIRROR:ElizabethMary Downing is a typical American teenager...almost. When she peers into amirror, she sees someone else staring back--an image identical to herself inevery detail save one--the mirror image has blue eyes. Elizabeth's eyes are brown!She is told by her mirror counterpart, \"Liz,” that she can enter anymirror she wants through \"trans-starence,” and when curiosity prevailsover fear she enters the mirror, trading places with Liz. The horror begins asLiz wreaks havoc with what was a normal life. Elizabeth's attempts to trick Lizinto going back into the mirror reflect both suspense and humor, and just whenall hope seems lost, she succeeds...only to discover she has to return to themirror to reverse events and get her life back to where it was. She succeeds, butshe leaves part of herself forever in the mirror. Blueskies,Les"},

{"title": "Maegan Beaumont--Writer Extraordinaire! ", "date": "Monday, August 13, 2012", "text": "Hi folks,Irarely do this, but I’ve asked a student of mine to provide a guest blog today.Please welcome Meagan Beaumont! Her story is truly inspirational as you’ll see.Maeganfirst entered my life when she enrolled in a class I was teaching for PhoenixCollege a couple of years ago. That class has since morphed into an ongoingclass with some of those Phoenix College students, some of the folks I taughtfor Writer’s Digest classes, some from the Skype class I co-teach with JennyMilchman for the New York Writer’s Workshop, some from the ranks of the privateclients I coach on their novels, and some from other contacts who asked if Ihad a class. We keep it to about a dozen writers (and unlimited auditors) andthe majority of them continue on into each succeeding class. Classes runvarious lengths—from eight weeks to twelve—to give us a bit of variety. (And arest! We usually take a week or two off between classes.)Inall my classes, no matter what the venue, I require two things to begin with.We begin with each class member’s novel and at the beginning and work throughfrom that point. I ask each to submit a 15-20 word outline for the entire noveland I ask each to submit five pages for the first week which should include theinciting incident.Thething is, if a writer doesn’t begin where their outline indicates itshould—with the inciting incident—that writer continues to submit thatbeginning scene until they’ve created a bona fide inciting incident. Over time,class members have adopted the phrase “inciting incident hell” to describe thisexperience. It’s very rare for a new writer to deliver the proper incitingincident in the first week. And, they’re not allowed to proceed beyond thatfive-page limit until they do.Myfeeling is that if the novel doesn’t begin properly, the writer is headed forthe shoals of an unfinished novel, or, if finished, an unpublishable novel.It’s imperative that they begin in the right place.Mostspend from an average of 2-4 weeks before they nail the opening and get pastthat first five pages.Maeganholds the all-time record.Maeganspent NINE WEEKS IN INCITING INCIDENTHELL. Nineweeks…Outof a 12-week course. For nine weeks of the total of 12 weeks in the class, shenever got past the inciting incident. At the end of nine weeks, she had a grandtotal of five pages of her novel written.Didshe quit? Well, you already know the answer to that. Did she get mad at me? Call me a no-heart  bastard? Get frustrated? Of course. But, the important thing is, she didn’t quit. She hungon like a bulldog. That’s when I knew she was going to be successful at thiswriting thing.Maeganhad talent. That was obvious from the very beginning. However, there are a tonof people who have talent who will never get published. Talent is rarely thedeciding factor in who finds their books on the shelves of Barnes & Noble.Hardwork and perseverance are what separates the author from the typist. Payingone’s dues through old-fashioned blood, sweat and tears is the determiningfactor, almost always.And,Maegan had both of those traits in abundance.Shealso had a 700-page completed novel in her possession when she began.Longgone.Inits place, she has a top agent and a two-book deal with an option for a third.I recommended her and her work to my agent, Chip Macgregor, and Chip justplaced her novels with Llewelleyn/Midnight Ink with a separate advance for eachnovel. Be on the lookout for the first novel, Maegan’s riveting thriller titledTHE FIRST. You can be sure I’ll announce the release date here!Kindof cool, isn’t it? Her journey as a writer is much the same as the journey ofthe protagonist in a good novel. As it should be.Here’sMaegan, with her story in her own words.From the pen of Maegan Beaumont:My journey started as they all do—I tookone foot and placed it in front of the other, foolishly believing that I had itall under control. I had a finished manuscript—a 750 page tome that I knewneeded work. A lot of work. The problem was—I had absolutely no idea what I wasdoing. I mean, really, I had no ideawhat I was doing. I knew enough to be certain that 250,000 words was a bitheavy for a thriller, but beyond that—color me clueless. I’d never taken anytype of writing class. I’d never had any type of instruction… did I mention howutterly and ridiculously ignorant I was?I enrolled in an online college class,and this is where I think fate (or whatever you want to call it) intervened. Iread the course description for a class called Planning and Structuring theNovel and noted that I needed pre-recs I didn’t have. I contacted theinstructor (Les Edgerton—sounds likea nice guy—I imagined sweater vests and Hush Puppies…) and asked for anexemption, and guess what? He gave it to me. I was in. The first week was brutal—Mr. SweaterVest ripped me a new one. Week two had him shoving his Hush Puppy-clad foot upmy… well, let’s just say it was a tad uncomfortable. Weeks three through eightwere similar. I cried. I bled. I fantasied about strangling Mr. Sweater Vestwith my laptop cord. Things were not going as I had planned.See, he wanted me to write this thingcalled an “Inciting Incident”. I mean, what the hell is that? Turns out, if I’dhave just stopped crying so freakin’ loud, I would’ve heard him explain it tome. An Inc Inc (as we call it in the Land of Les) is your protagonist’scatalyst. It’s the first sign of trouble—and we all know that novels are abouttrouble… But I digress.Week nine was my week—the week it finally sank in. I nailed my Inc Inc. Idelivered a believable scene that wasn’t overwrought with melodramaticbullshit. I created believable characters and figured out that I have a waywith dialogue. All the while Les guided me, gave me kudos when I earned themand smacked me silly when I lost my way. It sounds brutal—and it was. But I neededit and looking back, I’m damn glad I was fortunate enough to find him, smartenough to realize that this is a man that knows what he’s talking about, andtoo stubborn to quit when things got tough.It took me a year to re-write my novel.Three months to place it with an agent and another four to find it a home.That’s right, folks—I landed a book deal. A two book deal with an option forthe third. My hard work isn’t over, as a matter of fact I have a feeling it’sjust begun—knowing that makes me feel like it’s week one all over again andI’ve got Mr. Sweater Vest doing the Hush Puppy wind-up. But I can handle it. I know I can,because Les didn’t just teach me about proper story structure and characterarc. He taught me how to survive. His methods aren’t for everyone. He canbe brutal. And he’ll tell you flat-out that just wanting it badly enough—isn’tenough. It takes hard work and a willingness to check your ego at the door. Adesire to learn and an understanding that the learning never stops. In short:you have to become a writer.A real writer—and that’s what I am. I ama writer.Because Les Edgerton made me into one. Be that as it may, my life isn’tactually conducive to the craft. Two of my four kids are adopted. Both haveADHD and were born exposed to meth. My oldest—my only daughter—is a grade-Adrama queen who will burst into tears if I so much as offer her a piece of gum(true story) and my middle son believes wholeheartedly that it is his destinyto invent time travel... so every day is a goat rodeo. I don't think of it as astruggle. That's just my life. People always ask me \"How do you doit?\" I think the question is a silly one. I just do it. What's myalternative? Running away to join the circus? Thanks, but I've already got one,and besides, I think clowns are creepy.Amidst the chaos I make the time towrite. I don’t find it. I makeit—there’s a difference. I don't sleep. Sometimes my kids eat PB&J fordinner. Most times there are dishes in my sink. I'm late picking my kids upfrom school at least one day a week. Because writing is more important to methan getting a full 8 hours (or even 5, for that matter...) of sleep, or combingthe tassels on my area rugs. Writing keeps me sane and my sanity is important.My saving grace is and always will be myhusband. He can be a colossal pain in my ass and is never home (he's a truckdriver—home 3 days out of 7) but when I got my book deal, I could practicallysee the pride oozing from his pores. When I’m on a roll and he’s just come homefrom a 36-hour run, he slams a Monster and takes the kids to the park so I canwrite it out in peace. When I say “I’m almost finished with this scene,” heunderstands that that means he won’t see me for another six hours. He doesn’tlike it. But he gets it. We’re teammates—sometimes he’s playing football whileI’m playing water polo, but we make it work, because failure has never been anoption for either of us and because I choose my teammates very wisely. I’ve lost a few along the way. People Iloved. People who didn’t understand or appreciate the journey I was on. Peoplewho didn’t like the fact that I was changing. Who seemed to take my growth andhappiness as some sort of personal insult. Like I was doing it to them onpurpose. I wasted time and energy trying to make them happy. I fought againstthe loss of them, because that’s what I do, but in the end, I let them go. Icame to understand that what was wrong with them, had nothing to do with me,and nothing I do will ever change the way they feel about themselves.But for every person I lost, I foundsomeone that loved me more than their idea of who they wanted me to be. Theyunderstood if I didn’t call them for a week and a half. They’d offer to pick mykids up from school because I was knee-deep in it and knew that even though I could put a pin in it, I didn’t necessarilywant to. They read my crappy first-drafts and didn’t panic when I bought bookson how to poison people and spent weeks at a time researching nanotechnology.If they found my obsession with serial killers alarming, they kept it tothemselves. These are the people I share my success and failure with. The onesthat stuck it out. The ones that matter.So, my advice: Write. Don’t worry about the number ofdishes in your sink or the fact that your kids might eat more peanut butterthan the kid next door. Buy paper plates and put Pizza Hut on speed dial. Kidslove pizza and guess what—they’re resilient. Write. If you have a support system—useit. Your spouse. Your friends. Your family. If they love you, they want you tobe happy and will be willing to go the extra mile to see you that way.Write. Don’t be afraid to let go of theperson people think you are. You areso much more than the expectations of others. Dive in, head-first. The onesstill waiting for you when you come up for air are the ones that matter. Write. Find a mentor—someone willing tooffer guidance and support in things your friends and family might notunderstand. Join a writing group—a good one, not a cheerleading squad.

{"title": "THE BEST WRITERS' WORKSHOP EVER!", "date": "Thursday, July 19, 2012", "text": "Hifolks,I’vejust returned—well, returned a few days ago and just now recovering from totalexhaustion—from the week-long Antioch Writers’ Workshop in Yellow Springs,Ohio.Check it out here: http://www.antiochwritersworkshop.com/ Simplyput: One of the single best experiences of my life.I’vebeen privileged to have participated in a bunch of really cool writer’sworkshops and writer’s events, but this one is at the top. My favorites thatI’ve taken part in include Wordburst in Phoenix for Phoenix College, the BEA,the Writer’s Institute at the University of Wisconsin, Gemini Ink in SanAntonio, the First Annual Texas Book Festival, the Writer’s Retreat Workshops,and others. But, Antioch stands alone in my experience.Lemmetell you about it. Audience at a reading in the auditorium at Antioch.My group—THEBEST WORKSHOP GROUP EVERFirst,I want to introduce you to the participants in my own afternoon fictionworkshop. I had six writers in my merry band, which all of us refer toroutinely now as “The Best Workshop Group Ever.” There was my new best friend,Rob Boley whose laugh-out-loud novel about a Snow White we’ve never experiencedhad the first 50 pages requested by a visiting agent with the Fine Line Agency(Rob and I hung out every single night and closed down a few bars…). Along withRob, our family included Sarah Zettler, a teacher in Columbus with an amazingYA novel titled Breaking the Flatline,Audrey Craig who grew up and lived for years in South Africa and is writing avery original sci-fi, titled Calidis,Toni Lapp, a magazine editor from Kansas City who has a novel based on a truestory that is going to sell tons of copies when finished, Kate Geiselman, whobrought to our group a brilliant short story titled “Presents” which sheintends to be one of a collection of linked stories—a story that haunted melong after I read it, and Sherie Cooper-Daragh, who allowed me to call her byher real name (Cheryl—don’t try it without her permission!) and who is writinga stunning novel about a relationship that’s a winner.Everysingle one of the writers in my group is a winner and is writing publishablestuff. They’ve all got major talent up the yazoo. And, I mean major talent. Made my job easy!Mygroup of writers provided me with the single biggest moment I experienced. Acouple of days before the end of the workshop, I had left a restaurant and wason my way to our daily meeting spot, the Spirited Goat Coffee Shop (never didfind out the source of that name…), and passed by the Ye Olde Trail Tavern, and theremy entire group, sans one (Kate, who would have been with them but as she wason the Antioch board was required to be somewhere else at the time) was sittingat a table together, hanging out. They had bonded as a family! I may havemissed it, but I don’t think any other workshop group ended up together just hangingout. It just drove home to me that we’d truly become a family.Later,at the reading where all the groups read their work, I introduced our group as“The Best Group Ever” and said that while I was sure all the other groups weregood, we were going to knock it out of the park. After the event, I had half adozen people come up to me and tell me I’d called it—there was no doubt theywere the best group. They hit it into the upper deck, way out past theBudweiser sign into the cheap seats… The Best Group Ever!L-R front row--Cherie, moi, Kate, Toni and Sarah.L-R back row--Rob and Audrey (At our meeting place, the Spirited Goat Coffee Shop)Privateconsultation. Wepresenters were also privileged to be able to offer private consultations withwriters on their manuscripts and I had the pleasure of working with Greta Holton her Mennonite coming-of-age novel, titled Babyface. We were supposed to spend 45 minutes on eachconsultation, but I liked Greta’s novel so much and saw so much promise in itthat I asked if she minded if we spent another hour on it and she liked theidea, so we set up another time to do so a couple of days hence. I predict she’llget this puppy published.Onething jumped out at me when working with Greta. I only had one suchconsultation, and Hallie Ephron had nine.Not to mention, she was a major presenter in the mornings and had to take a dayoff to fly to New York to attend and participate in a memorial service for herlate sister, Nora Ephron. I can’t imagine how she got it all done. I was exhaustedafter the week and Hallie did everything I did, plus, and, in addition, somehow found the time and energy to takepart in nine evaluations. She’s notonly an amazing author and teacher, she has a work ethic that is unmatched by us mortals.The town ofYellow Springs, OhioIwas absolutely knocked out by this town! I understand it was a “planned town”back in the day and if so, whoever planned it, got it absolutely perfect. I’dmove there in a nanosecond. It’s a town you aren’t prepared for—once you visitit, you begin to think you’re on the East or West Coast and not in the Midwest.The shops are small and comfortable and interesting. And, everywhere. It’s aMade-for-TV town—exactly the kind of place one would design for families whoare interested in intellectual stimulation and the arts. The Tannenbaums wouldbe at home here. I hung out in a bunch of places, including the Spirited Goat,the Ye Olde Trail Tavern, Peaches Grill, and even my kind of bucket o’ bloodbar, which I kept calling “The Dungeon” but was actually called The GulchSaloon. (For my Vermont College friends, think “Charlie O’s.”) For some reasonit reminded me of an old hangout of mine in New Orleans called The Dungeon. Whatsold me on the town was passing by a souvenir shop that had work by R. Crumb inthe window. Where do you see R. Crumb’s art featured in the Midwest? YellowSprings, that’s where!It’sa bicycle town—a mecca for those nuts who ride bikes (like my wife…). There aregorgeous bike trails everywhere and everyone seems to ride every place they go.Didn’t see many skateboarders which was a good thing… One cool thing—we wereadvised to cross streets in the middle of the block—the residents would alwaysstop—and nobody local crossed at the “official” crossing places on the cornersand if we did, we might surprise the residents who might run over us insurprise.Laid-backis the most apt description for Yellow Springs. All of the locals are friendlyand speak to you and are genuinely happy you’re in their town. I’ve been toplenty of other towns where the citizens loved the tourists’ money but it wasclear they didn’t always like the tourists themselves, but Yellow Springs folksare genuinely glad to see and meet you.Onthe night of the participants’ reading back at the campus, I was down at theSpirited Goat where an out-of-town poet was setting up for her reading lateron. We reluctantly told her we couldn’t attend as we had our own event andthen, when I walked outside to go back up Dayton St. to the campus, there weretwo middle-aged guys, dressed and looking exactly like screenwriter Buck Henry,sitting outside with scripts in front of them, trying dialog out on each otherand making notations on their scripts. I asked if they were screenwriters andthey said no, they were playwrights and were making last-minute corrections totheir play that was opening in an hour across the street. They invited us toattend and we had to decline. But, can you imagine? We had our reading at thecollege, a visiting poet was having her own reading and across the street aplay was opening? What other town would this be a regular occurrence in? Can’t thinkof any, at least in a town of this size.Andthere were street people like I’ve never seen before. Now, I’ve been a streetperson myself and homeless, but these folks were unlike any street people I’dever encountered. Most were musicians and were the reincarnation of thewandering minstrels of old England. Only playing contemporary and original music.And, truly beautiful, gentle people in spirit and deportment. One morning, Istruck up a conversation with a homeless musician at the Goat and as ittranspired, he was from Goshen, Indiana, and as we talked, it turned out hisolder brother was best friends with my nephew, Kevin Bowen. He borrowed theGoat’s owner’s phone—a delightful guy named Michael—and called his brother backhome to tell him he’d just run into Kevin’s uncle “Butch” (that’s me). Itbrought home to both of us how small our world really is. This young man—sorry,I can’t recall his name—will have to ask Kevin—was barefoot and showed me hisfeet, which were as black as Macbeth’s heart and covered with countless cuts.He showed me not for sympathy, but to ask what I thought his “sign” should bethat day—to say “WORK WANTED” or “NEED BAND-AIDS.” I recommended the Band-Aidsone… I thought originality might pay off better and he agreed.Eachnight—most spent going back and forth between Peaches and The Gulch—we spentoutside on their patios, chinning with both locals and the homeless and it feltlike Haight-Asbury without any of the negatives. We had a “core” group of me,Rob and Amanda Winfield, who is a student at Antioch and works in the library.Three Musketeers and we all just hit it off wonderfully. Amanda is a poet and abeautiful person, inside and out.Everyday for lunch, workshop participants would sign up to have lunch with thefaculty at various places around town and there’d be two of us faculty peopleand up to ten participants. Just like everything else, Antioch is integratedinto the town and you feel the town is just part of the campus. Just a trulyunique and delightful place.Mostdays, when we had a bit of free time, I hung out with my other new best friend,nonfiction bestselling writer, Jerry Dennis. We flat-out hit it off. Turns outwe have several mutual friends like poet and nonfiction writer Sydney Lee. I’mreading Jerry’s brilliant book right now, TheLiving Great Lakes, an instant classic and wonderfully-writ account of thehistory of the Great Lakes. When we met, for me it was like meeting mylong-lost twin brother. You know how there are certain people when you meetthere’s an instant and deep connection? It was like that for me with Jerry,with Rob, and with Amanda. Old souls I knew well in a former life. People Ijust want to spend lots of time with, sipping on a brew in an outdoor patio,and talking literature and life.PoetJeff Gundy came down to The Gulch and had beers with Amanda, Rob and me, and wehad a great conversation. Another poet, Jim Daniels, was a guy I would have likedto have spent more time with, as I would have like to with Dave Halperin whosenew novel, Journal of a UFO Investigatoris one of the most original coming-of-age accounts ever.Allof the faculty gave readings of our work. Since Hallie Ephron had to leave forher sister’s memorial, we switched places and I read on Monday along with SandiWisenberg and Chet Kelly Robinson. I read one of my personal favorites, “Toothache.”Other readers included Crystal Wilkinson, Linda Gerber, Trudy Krisher, andCarrie Bebris, every single one a winner.Theparticipants had their own reading night at The Emporium, a coffee and wineshop downtown and it was amazing. There were close to forty readers and I’venever seen anything like this before in my life—there was not a single clunkerin the bunch! This never happens! There wasn’t even one reading that wasmediocre! They made a mistake, perhaps. They let comedian John Bunyan lead itoff and he is one tough act to follow. Just laugh until your ribs crack humor.Maureen andRichard LynchIstayed in a private home that I kept raving about to my wife Mary when I calledhome. I kept describing it as a “Frank Lloyd Wright designed-home if it werecommissioned to create his dream house.” My gracious and wonderful hosts wereMaureen and Richard Lynch and if I were them, I’d never leave their house!Antioch Writers’Workshop folksIhesitate to begin naming names as I know I’ll leave somebody out and then I’llfeel bad as each and every person I met became my “new best friend.” It beginswith Sharon Short, the guiding light of the workshop and the hardest and mosttireless worker that I’ve ever met who wasn’t on drugs. That sounds bad,doesn’t it? Especially when you meet Sharon and are pretty sure the only drug she’sfamiliar with is her amazing adrenaline. Get Sharon’s newest novel, theforthcoming “book club” novel, My OneSquare Inch of Alaska, or any of her previous nine mystery novels for aterrific reading experience.Thefirst person I met upon arrival, Cyndi Pauwels, greeted me warmly and set thetone for the entire week. One of my many “new best friends” was Dave Kunka, thebookstore manager who not only went way, way out of his way to help me, but wereally hit it off as friends.Twoguys who helped run the place and who I became good friends with, were TobinTerry and Ron. Tobin was the second-in-command working with Sharon and waseverywhere I went, organizing things. Ron, I’m sorry I can’t recall your lastname, dude! He and I really hit it off as we’ve lived in some of the sameplaces in Louisiana—he’s a Cajun and a graphic artist. The reason I can’tremember Ron’s last name is that he’s one of only two Cajuns who aren’t namedBoudreau…*Late note. Tobin just emailed me and told me Ron's last name is Maynard. No wonder I couldn't remember it. What Cajun is named \"Maynard?\" Change it to Boudreau, dude! Ron is one of the coolest guys I've met in a long, long time. Just on top of his game. Iwish I could remember the names of all the dozens and dozens of people I got tochat with, but hope they’ll excuse me and attribute it to my Halfzeimer’s… Justso many terrific people!Ifyou can only go to one writer’s conferences/workshops in your lifetime, this isthe one I’d recommend. I’ve been to dozens and while they were all wonderfulexperiences, none were like this for just a pure enjoyable experience foreveryone.Tell‘em I sentcha!Blueskies,LesPostscript.All week long, I kept telling my workshop group that when I left YellowSprings, I was going to appear at the Indiana Romance Writer’s group in Indy onSunday. I kept raving about what a terrific group of professional writersromance writers are—and they are! Well, the only problem was my appearance wasscheduled for Saturday, not Sunday. I got back into Ft. Wayne on Saturday andwent immediately to bed. I was utterly exhausted. Left over 900 emailsunopened. Just too tired to even think about opening them.Mybad.Igot up early Sunday, preparing to drive down to Indy, and opened my email… todiscover I was supposed to have been there the day before!

{"title": "NEW SHORT STORY TITLED \"TOURETTES\"", "date": "Tuesday, July 3, 2012", "text": "Hi folks,Still without electricity! This bites... Word is, we'll have juice back on tomorrow. Anyway, I can get down to a nearby coffeeshop once a day to charge the ol' laptop and check emails. Usually have about an hour to do stuff, and one of the things I'm doing now is posting this.Noir writer/editor Court Merrigan contacted me a while back to ask if I'd send him a short story for his emagazine Bareknuckles Pulp Press which he was relaunching after a hiatus, and he did me the honor of saying he'd like mine to be the first story for the relaunch. How in the heck can anyone refuse such a distinct honor? I sure couldn't! Problem was, I don't write short stories these days, but I came up with a solution, and came up with an excerpt from my as-yet-unpublished black comedy crime novel, THE GENUINE, IMITATION, PLASTIC KIDNAPPING.  This book was the most fun I've ever had in front of a typewriter and with most of my clothes on and I'm writing a second novel with the same characters in what I hope becomes a series. I sent the excerpt to Court and he claimed he loved it and I guess maybe he did as he published it and if you want to check it out, just go to http://www.outofthegutteronline.com/2012/07/bareknuckles-pulp-no-1-tourettes.html and start reading.Not to give stuff away, but there's a scene in it where the protagonist's main squeeze, Cat, who happens to be a call girl, provides a diversion for him in a black bar so he can escape being rendered room temperature by Sam Capelli, the enforcer for the local Mafia to whom he owes money. This novel came to life first as a short story published in THE SOUTH CAROLINA REVIEW, and then I wrote this novel, and then I wrote a screenplay based on it. When I wrote the screenplay, I was teaching for the UCLA Writer's Program, and was engaged in co-writing another screenplay with Steve Duncan, a black screenwriter who wrote THE COURT-MARTIAL OF JACKIE ROBINSON (A TNT Special), and was the creator/runner for two TV series, A MAN NAMED HAWK and TOUR OF DUTY. I was afraid this scene might offend black readers/viewers, so I ran it past Steve to get his opinion from a black man's pov. \"Shit, Les,\" he said. \"This is just plain funny stuff! Nobody's going to be upset at all.\" And so I kept it in.Hope you enjoy the read. Also, if anyone happens to be friends with Woody Harrelson, I'd love to have him read the screenplay. I wrote it envisioning him to be the lead character, Pete, but he'd need to read it to determine if he'd be interested or not. I almost had a chance to contact him a few years ago when my dentist said he'd send it to him, but that never materialized. My dentist, a cool guy named Ron Rumbaugh played in a band with Woody when they were both at Hanover College and they've remained friends, but time passed and I didn't press Ron to send it to him and now we've kind of lost touch. So...(You just never know who knows who...)Blue skies,Les"},
{"title": "Storms, electricity, reviews and a contest!", "date": "Monday, July 2, 2012", "text": "Hifolks,It’sbeen a hectic few days here in Ft. Wayne. Last Friday, the temp reached arecord 106 degrees (108 by our own thermometer!), and then a cold front came inand along with it near-tornadoes. Don’t know if we had any actual tornadoes—rumorswere that two touched down—but the winds were fierce—reportedly 80-90 mph--andpower lines were (and are) down all over town. As of this morning, there arestill over 70,000 homes and businesses without power—including us. We’re stillstaying in our house and nights are miserable as the heat’s back. They’retelling us we may be without power until late Wednesday night. I’ve been ableto go to coffee shops and cobble this together a bit at a time.Firstthing is, I want to post a review I did of Brit author Richard Godwin’s amazingnew novel, MR. GLAMOUR. A fantastic read! Here’s what I think of it:My review of Richard Godwin’s MR.GLAMOURWhile most readers and reviewerswere drawn to the plot and the mystery of Richard Godwin’s brilliant novel, Mr. Glamour--as I was as well--I wasstruck even more by the setting. After all, once you know “whodunit,” usuallythere’s no reason to return to the book. In this case, there is. I’ve now readit twice and will read it several more times and it’s not to find out“whodunit” but to learn even more about both the psychology of the charactersand to learn about a part of London I was sharply ignorant of. The insightsGodwin provides of both are worth many hours in rereading what I predict willbecome a classic.What Eugene Izzi did for the city ofChicago in novels like The Criminalist,Richard Godwin has done for London in Mr.Glamour. Like Raymond Chandler who was one of the best at creating acharacter out of the setting—in his case, Los Angeles--Godwin has given usLondon as a character. A London not seen heretofore, at least in noir. Mostwriters deliver us the seedy underworld of the city—the world of workingman’sand thieves’ bars and prostitute haunts and dank gaols populated by sadisticguards and murderous felons—whereas Godwin has sharply defined the world of theupper crust as being veined with the same dark blood as flowed through Jack theRipper’s carotid… if Jack wore Armani and ate at the best four-starrestaurants.This is a story of the “BeautifulPeople” but none are beautiful save for their designer clothes and cars andmansions and platinum cards and the other trappings of wealth. All are twistedand ugly in one way or the other. This is surely the nihilistic view of awriter who has experienced life and thought hard about it and knows with asurety that’s discomfiting, that we all possess what Jung termed “the shadowside” no matter what level of society we find ourselves perched on. This is astory about the upper crust, but not the faction that we normally expect tosee—not the royalty of London and England, but the portion of wealthy societythat’s gained its advantage in ways other than inheritance or family. This is apart of London that’s more akin to Hollywood than either the England of LordFaversham or the London of Tiny Tim and Nell. It’s a world that is particularlyof the 21st century and could not have been set anywhere else or inany other period.This novel reminds me of somethingauthor Sharon Sheehe Stark told me during one of my MFA residencies at VermontCollege where she was on the faculty and my workshop leader. She said, “Whenyou create a villain, if you want a truly great one, don’t use thatoft-advised technique of ‘making ‘em like kittens.’” No, she said: “Paint themas black as you possibly can, for if you do that, the light will shine throughthe cracks.” She’d be pleased about Mr.Glamour, for that’s exactly what Godwin does.Flannery O’Connor, in speaking ofgreat endings, would doubtlessly approve of Godwin’s ending here, when she said(badly paraphrased) that “a great ending will surprise the reader, but, uponreflection be the only possible and best ending to be had.” A perfectdescription for Mr. Glamour. Trustme—you won’t see this one coming! And then… you’ll exclaim, “Of course!”For readers of mystery, ofthrillers, of horror, of noir—this novel will satisfy each particular taste. Itwill also satisfy the palate of those who enjoy simply good literature, for itis that as well. If this were a restaurant, it would have earned its Michelinstar.You can glom onto a copy (U.S.)here: http://www.amazon.com/Mr-Glamour-Richard-Godwin/dp/0956711332/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1341241255&sr=1-1&keywords=mr.+glamourOr in Europe, here: http://www.amazon.co.uk/s/ref=nb_sb_noss?url=search-alias%3Dstripbooks&field-keywords=mr.+glamour&x=0&y=0Susan LernerAnd now I’d like to give a wonderfulnew author some props with her first novel. Please meet Susan Lerner. Susanasked me to work with her on her novel A SUITABLE HUSBAND. It’s out now,available both in paperback and as an ebook. Here’s the review I wrote forAmazon and Goodreads:Astunning portrayal of the changing social and political climate of 1930s Polandas embodied by Bianca Lieber, a young Jewish woman caught between thetraditional family values of her parents and those of a volatile younger generation,unwilling to accept the status quo.It has become almost a cliché to describe a novel as a `page turner,' but inthis instance, the description is apt. The writing is never forced, and thepressure never lifts from Bianca, her mother, and her twin brother; each withtheir own, often conflicting, hopes and dreams, but all of them strugglingagainst increasingly anti-Semitic government policies and harsh new realities.Occasionally, a work of fiction appears that transcends mere genre and simpleentertainment and enters a new level of literary worth. A Suitable Husband is abook that is a truly modern look at the issues that face all of us in arapidly-changing world. It is one of those books that has the potential tochange the reader in a profound way.Glomonto a copy at http://www.amazon.com/dp/B008EMDUEO/ref=as_li_ss_til?tag=sbleau-20&camp=213381&creative=390973&linkCode=as4&creativeASIN=B008EMDUEO&adid=05ZM7ZPY6XG27RBJ7F48&&ref-refURL=http%3A%2F%2Fsblerner.com%2FYou’ll be glad you did—it’s a trulyremarkable novel.And,finally… Zurich writer Veronica Sicoe is having a little contest on her blogthat includes yours truly.

{"title": "STORAGE WARS AND CREATING TENSION IN NOVELS", "date": "Friday, June 8, 2012", "text": "Hifolks,Justabout all of us writer types are always looking for ways to improve our craft.I know I am, and I’ll bet a month’s rent you are as well. Sometimes, I think welimit ourselves a bit by only going to the “regular” sources for help onimproving our art. You know: craft books, webinars, writer’s conferences,blogs, video presentations… all of those places we know we can findinformation. Those are all great sources, but sometimes I think we miss othergreat places where writing instruction might be available.Ifyou’ve followed my lil blog here awhile, you might remember the bit I did onChef Gordon Ramsay. Remember I compared what he put forth on his KITCHENNIGHTMARES shows as being perfectly suited for writers? Absolutely!Well,for the past few weeks I’ve been thinking about another show that I thinkprovides great examples for writers to use in improving our craft.STORAGEWARS!Yep.If you haven’t seen an episode, check it out on the Arts & Entertainmentnetwork. http://www.aetv.com/storage-wars/You’ll be happy you did I think, especially after seeing what I found valuablefor our craft in the show.TENSION.Yes,tension. As gripping as any LinwoodBarclay mystery or Stephen King horror novel. Well, maybe not quite as tense asMr. King’s and Mr. Barclay’s work—pretty hard to beat the masters! But, stillenough tension to warrant our taking a look at how they achieve it and apply itto our own work.First,for those who perhaps haven’t seen the program, it’s about a group of peoplewho make their livings by going to storage locker places and buying, inauction, those lockers which’ve been abandoned by their previous owners.Soundskinda sucky, doesn’t it! I imagine the producers had a better pitch descriptionthan I came up with! But, basically, that’s what the show is about.I’llbet that before this show aired many of us have at least been to a storagelocker place and never once thought of it as the setting for a gripping show. Iknow I never did! But these folks made this apparently innocuous setting and “ordinary”characters so interesting that my wife and I have even talked about chucking itall and entering the business ourselves… Well, briefly. Then, my wife Maryinserted some common sense into the discussion by uttering the magic words, “Noway, Charlie A. Cheese.”Anyway.Back on point.Ifyou haven’t watched an episode, do so at your first opportunity. When you watchthe show, take note of the commercials. Well, not the commercials themselves—thepart of the show immediately before the commercials come on. Notice something?If you’re anything like me, you’re silently urging the commercial to “hurry up,already!” We want to return to the place the narrative stopped before the adpopped up. We grow more and more impatient as the ads appear, and then, finally…finally… the show returns. But…another groan escapes our lips as what we see next is a brief snippet of whatwas last on the screen. And, what was that? Several standard things. It mightbe a glimpse at a locker that was just opened and Barry has just spotted anitem at the back everyone else missed. Although  It might be Jarrod and his bosomy (and sharp-tongued)wife Brandi who’s just gone through the locker he won in the auction for it andeverything they looked at was junk, until this last box and when he opened it,he exclaimed, “Oh my God!” At which point the screen went to… you guessed it…commercial breaks. Without allowing us to see what he’s going bananas over.Notonly were we transfixed waiting for the revelation of what was in Jarrod’s boxor what it was Barry spotted that put a gleam in his eye… the producers show areally cruel and even sick side of themselves… they don’t show what we’ve beenwaiting for right away, but heighten our tension even more by repeating thebuildup that they ended the previous segment with.Tension.Bypros.Spendsome time some evening and watch this show. See if you don’t see techniques youcan steal for your own fiction. I’ll bet that aforementioned rent money thatyou will.Whatother TV shows do this for you? Start watching shows with a new eye—when youcome across one where you can’t wait for the commercials to be over, study howthey achieved that effect in you and figure out how to apply it to your ownwriting.Ifa show about a storage locker facility can generate this kind of tension,imagine how their techniques will work in your own novel which has a way morecooler setting than a storage locker!Whatother television shows can you think of that achieve this?

{"title": "A Lesson on Story Worthy Problems and Latest Update on Amazon", "date": "Wednesday, May 30, 2012", "text": "Hi folks,I received the following question from one of the writers in the Skype class I co-teach with Jenny Milchman for the New York Writer's Workshop this afternoon and thought perhaps the answer I gave may be of some value to a few folks. Without further ado, here's Todd's question and my reply: Les,I was reading your comments on Stephen's work and a question occurred to me.You described the story-worthy problem as the \"spine\" of the novel. Iknow I overdid it with the eyes stuff in my last attempt, but how often shouldthe writer be reminding the reader of the SWP after the inciting incident? I'mguessing it's not nearly as much as the character's surface desire. When I wasin inciting incident hell you referred me to Allan Leverone's novelPASKAGANKEE, and it was extremely helpful seeing how the SWP (redemption forguilt) was just hinted at in the beginning, but the character's surface desire(to find the killer) was always on the page in some form or another. As surfaceproblem and SWP are joined at the hip, does the character remind the reader ofthe SWP simply by striving to solve the surface problem, or should there besome more direct attention called to the SWP so the \"spine\" of thenovel is always visible.Thanks,ToddGreatquestion, Todd! The answer is pretty simple. The story-worthy problem shouldn'tbe evident to the protagonist until almost literally, the final scene. It'sreally what the final epiphany is all about. It takes the entire struggle toresolve the surface problem to reveal to the protagonist what his or her\"real\" problem is. In T&L, this is crystal-clear. Up until themoment where they're at the edge of the Grand Canyon, Thelma's been focused onher surface problem. Now, the surface problem has grown into a much biggerbeast by that time... but it's still a surface problem (meaning still somewhatsuperficial). Look at how it’s evolved.1.Surface problem begins with Thelma wanting to escape her husband Darryl’ssmall-minded tyranny. At this point, she thinks that’ll take the weekend.She’ll defy him, go on the weekend camping trip with Louise and come back. Sheprobably hasn’t even thought much about what will happen when she returns.Probably has a kind of fuzzy image that she’ll get back, they’ll hae a majorknock-down fight, and the marriage will go on. Or not. She does know therelationship will have changed and for the better. She’s taken a big step bydefying him and she knows the dynamics have been changed forever. Is that inthe script? Nope. But, I’m in intelligent human being and that’s a fairly solidconclusion and one the author (Callie Khouri) most likely was aware of—afterall, she wrote the story for smart people.2.But, emboldened by her new-found courage, she takes it a step further andwheedles Louise into stopping for a drink. The day before the inciting incidentthere’s no way she could have and the stakes are raised by her new-foundfreedom in drinking.3.Further emboldened by deciding to drink and the rewards (freedom she hasn’texperienced before) and almost giddy with having fun, she takes it another stepforward and dances and flirts with Harlan. Another step toward raising the sizeof the problem and the stakes.4.Her flirting actions and unaccustomed drinking lead to going out to the parkinglot with Harlan and his attempted rape. See how every single step keepsincreasing the size of her surface problem.5.When Louise shoots and kills Harlan, the stakes are raised in a HUGE way. And,they’re raised as an organic consequence of her attempts to gain her freedom.But, it’s still the same surface problem. Just a few extra elements added. Now,besides escaping Darryl’s dominance, she has other men trying to enslave her(by capturing her and sending her to jail).Iwon’t go through all the subsequent plot steps here, but do you see how eachaction she takes to resolve her surface problem keep increasing the size andscope of the same problem? Every single step is organic, meaning it is birthedby her latest action (failed) to resolve the surface problem. When they decideto escape to Mexico, it’s still the same form and same problem (albeit bigger)that it was when she began.And,all the way up to the final scene, she doesn’t realize what her story-worthyproblem is. It’s only when she’s cornered at the Grand Canyon, and it’s onlywhen the full import of what she’s gone through, finally hits her with the fullrealization of what her real problem really is. It’s Darryl… but it’s far, farmore than just Darryl. It’s Harlan, it’s the state trooper, it’s J.T., it’s thetanker driver, it’s even the antagonist Hal who only wants to save her andLouise, that’s her much, much deeper psychological problem. Her story-worthyproblem is that she’s a total prisoner in a totally male-dominated world. But,she can’t achieve that final realization until she goes through everything shedid to resolve her surface problem. So, the protagonist cannot know what herstory-worthy problem is until the final scene. It’s that final scene that, witha good writer, that both the surface and the story-worthy problem aresimultaneously resolved. They’re really one and the same.Thisdoesn’t happen in all stories. Only in stories by the best writers. Lesserwriters don’t plan well enough or just aren’t talented enough to make thathappen. Which is why we see epilogues and crappola like that. From writers whoaren’t as good or talented as Khouri. But, why use those writers for modelswhen we have the best available?Theprotagonist can’t possibly know what the story-worthy problem is until thatfinal scene. Once she knows it, she has to resolve it. And, once the story’sresolved—it’s over.But,the author needs to know what thesurface problem is, and he/she absolutely and irrevocably has to know what thestory-worthy problem is. If he doesn’t, how on earth is he going to create aplot that leads his character to that point? The answer is, he can’t.And,you’ll run into people who say they never outline and claim they never know howtheir story will turn out. The so-called “pantsers.” They’ll even quote peoplelike Hemingway, who claimed he never outlined. Only, he did. Except Ernie’soutlines were 80,000 to 100,000 words long and not the 15-20 word version I askyou guys to create. And, he didn’t call what he did an outline. He called themDraft #1, Draft #2, Draft #8 and so on.Creating a story isn’t writing downreal life. It has to be better than real life. It also has to make sense andlife doesn’t. Stories are kind of hard to do if you don’t plan it out. Justthrow a character out there and follow ‘em around—see where they go and whatthey do. One can do that, but I strongly suspect that’s a writer who writeslots of “drafts.”Hope this answers your question,Todd. Actually, I’d like to use this for a blog post. Is that okay with you?

My understanding is that if a book cracks the top 100 Amazon itself begins promoting it once it goes back for sale. Also, if you'd click on the \"Like\" button I'm told it helps. Again, THANKS!Thereare a couple of blog posts that came out today that you may find interesting.Both are by Jed Ayres, the really cool writer who hosts Noir @ the Bar in St.Louis where I was recently privileged to appear and read at. Jed and I struckup a friendship and he wanted to know which books and movies I thoughtportrayed prisons accurately. Since I’m not aware of many, I talked insteadabout why I thought most got prison life wrong.Lately,I seem to have gotten my needle stuck on railing against the many inaccuraciesabout prison in books and movies. Mostly, that’s because I’ve just had it afterreading book after book by writers who don’t have a clue and keep perpetuatingout-and-out falsehoods. I’m kind of old-school in that it was always drummedinto me that a writer needed to be accurate. That the second-worst thing thatcould happen to a writer was that an editor found a factual error in amanuscript. The single-worst thing is for a reader to find such an error—that meantthe editor missed it and that kind of makes ‘em angry.But,like many things, it’s apparent to me that standards have slipped in the lastgeneration. I may be wrong, but I see substantially more and more writers whodon’t give a damn if they’re accurate or not. Not even a consideration. That,to me, is simply evidence of one thing. Laziness.Whatallows writers to get lazy is that no one calls them on these things. Mostinmates are poorly-educated and don’t read all that much. Not to mention thatmost prison libraries are abysmal. The one at my alma mater, Pendleton,consisted mostly of Zane Grey paperbacks witht the covers torn off for theirfiction offerings. (Never figured out why an inmate wanted those covers butthey do.) Not only don’t inmates in any appreciable numbers read crime orprison novels, it’s not like they’re regularly invited on Good Morning America to set the record straight. Not much of aforum for us ex-cons to let the public know that Mr. Megaseller is a phony andwouldn’t know a criminal from his dentist. So, writers creating prison scenespretty much have carte blanche. And that’s why I guess I’m talking about itthese days. If a heart procedure appears in a novel and the surgeon uses a soupspoon to open up the chest cavity, you can be fairly certain a number ofwhite-coated folks are going to be on TV and talking to reporters about themoron who wrote the medical thriller with the spoon. However, nobody’s askingus ex-cons if anyone in a real-life joint ever actually used the word “shiv” inactual conversation. (They don’t. It’s almost always exclusively “shank.” Or…ready?... knife.) If I ever heard an actual inmate use the term shiv, I’d know instantly this was ayoung kid who’d never been inside and got his knowledge of prison lore from badmovies and novels and was most likely headed for a bad ending as everyone wouldknow this was a guy who’d be easy pickings—he’s just revealed he’s an innocentand cons eat guys like this alive. Whenever I see this particular word, italways sets my teeth on edge.Anyway,check out Jed’s blogs. I’d begin with his Barnes & Noble newsletter for thefirst part of our conversation at http://bookclubs.barnesandnoble.com/t5/Ransom-Notes-The-BN-Mystery-Blog/Inside-Scoop-Les-Edgerton-s-Reasons-Why-Your-Prison-Fiction-Is/ba-p/1338672andthen go over to his Noir @ the Bar blog at http://spaceythompson.blogspot.com/2012/05/inside-scoop-les-edgertons-prison-myths.html forthe rest of it. BTW. Jed chose to lead this off with a photo of Nicholas Cage in RAISING ARIZONA, and his character in this black comedy as well as his rappies' characters are fairly accurate depictions of ex-cons... Good choice, Jed.Please know that I'm not advocating that only those who've actually been in prison write novels about prisons or that include prison scenes. Not at all! I don't expect only surgeons or nurses to write medical thrillers. Just make an effort to be accurate. There are probably at least 7-8 million ex-cons walking around, most likely a few even in your neighborhood. Just ask some of us to vet your book. At least make an effort to get it right. And,if anyone wants an accurate portrayal of the criminal mind or an accurateaccount of a prison, for the next three days, StoneGate Ink is offering freecopies of the ebook version of my autobiographical novel, JUST LIKE THAT. (Thepaperback version isn’t included in the freebie offering.)

When I returned from Noir @ the Bar, I found I'd been suffering from bronchitis for a couple of weeks. Just got that cleared up and it returned, along with pneumonia. Been hard to do much work, but fortunately I've got a great bunch of writers in my online workshop and they've allowed me to skate quite a bit! Same with the folks I'm privileged to work with in the Skype class I co-teach with Jenny Milchman--just very understanding people! Now, I've got the \"old man's lineup\" of pills facing me every day and it's a bear to remember when to take this, how long until I can take another, what to eat, when... yadda, yadda, yadda... Getting old ain't much fun, kids!Today, I'm excited to appear before the members of the Boulder (CO) Writer's Workshop for a webcam presentation with president Lori DeBoer. Sorry I can't invite folks, but I'll try to report how it went. Just saw that it's full, even for members, so I better take some more medicine--honey! Where did you put the Jack Daniels? Anyway, at 3 EST, I'll be over at http://www.boulderwritersworkshop.org/You might want to check them out and consider joining. They're a wonderful and vibrant group and offer all kinds of goodies to writers. Tell 'em I sentcha, okay?I keep popping up in really cool places. Just had a great piece on some of my books over  at http://catierhodes.com/2012/05/23/whats-new-may-2012/ that you may find interesting.And, then, a new interview just came up over at Luis Vera's new blog you may get a kick out of, at http://aknifeandaquill.wordpress.com/ A blog titled \"A Knife and Quill\" has to be cool!Should be seeing a new book from me from StoneGate Ink soon. It's a YA--yeah, I wrote a YA--wanna make something of it? Kidding, folks! Actually, I wrote it for my daughter Britney when she was a little tadpole and never thought of publishing it... until a couple of years ago when she brought it up and told me that it was four years after reading it that she could look into a mirror for more than 15 seconds. That's when I got the idea that if it scared her that much (and, believe me--Britney's fearless), that it might be publishable. And, Aaron Patterson of StoneGate agreed. It's about a teenaged girl who finds out she has a mirror twin and the twin talks her into trading places... but then won't let her out. It's titled... ready?... MIRROR, MIRROR. Don't know if it'll sell or not--there aren't any vampires in it nor any teen sex. We'll see...Got some other stuff coming up. I'll be the fiction presenter at the Antioch Writer's Workshop in Ohio for the week of July 7-13. They have a terrific program for all kinds of writers and I'm pretty sure they still have openings available if interested. I'd love it if some of you guys showed up and we can meet in person! Check it out at http://www.antiochwritersworkshop.com/Then, it gets hinky! The day after I get back home, I'm driving down to Franklin,Indiana to appear at the Midwest Romance Writer's Workshop.

{"title": "Update since Noir at the Bar", "date": "Monday, May 14, 2012", "text": "Hifolks,SorryI’ve been absent for some time, but have had a series of mishaps ever since Iwent to read at Noir at the Bar in St. Louis.Firstthing that happened was that the day before I left, my brand-new desktopcomputer took an electrical surge and got fried. Right after that, my laptoptook a surge also but I got lucky with it. The battery kept it from gettingfried.Won’tgo into all the problems this has caused, but basically I’ve been without acomputer up to even now. I teach an online class and a Skype class and it’sbeen pure hell to keep up. Thank God I have the most understanding students andalso, in my Skype class, the most understanding co-teacher in Jenny Milchman,who’s been an angel in all this. As has been Maegan Sampson who facilitates myonline class. Thanks, guys!SinceI can’t take the chance of plugging my laptop into an outlet at home until that’sfixed, I work on stuff from the battery for an hour and a half until it dies,then take it across the street to my neighbor’s to charge it… and she’s notalways home. For my Skype class, I have to truck across town to my (wonderful!)mother-in-law’s house to use her outlets. Woke up the first day after St. Louisto over 400 emails to answer! Go down to the public library to work on those,which is difficult as we have one car and my wife Mary needs it to go to workso I wait until she gets home. Goes on and on…Wehave an electrician coming over Wednesday to install a separate line for my computerand hopefully that’ll get things back to normal. Of course, I’m still withoutmy brand-new desktop and don’t know when I’ll be getting that back. And, don’tknow if it’s covered by warranty or not… Hoping, as I’m out of money…St.Louis’ Noir at the Bar was fantastic! My mentor (and hero and publisher) CortMcMeel put us up at the Cheshire Inn and it was totally awesome. Mary keepstalking about the fantastic kingsized bed we had. Best night’s sleep we’ve hadin years.Wearrived on Friday (the reading was on Saturday night) and our host, Jeb Ayres,came down and took Mary and I out to eat at a club near his house. We allbecame instant best friends. Later, Mary went up to our room, and Jeb and Iknocked back brews in the hotel bar and then Cort showed up around midnight andwe continued to knock back brews. Turned out, Cort figured he’d grab a roomwhen he got off the plane from Denver, but all the ball clubs were in town, plussome kind of mega science fair that drew over 30,000 kids and their families,so there wasn’t a room left in town. Ended up, he spent the night sleeping onour hotel room floor (in the room he’d paid for—what we writer types call “poeticjustice” or some such term). Cort’s a truly tough guy—a former boxer—and claimedhe slept just fine. This was the first time we’d met in person and we’d bondedover the years via the phone and internet and the instant we met, I knew I’dmet my spiritual brother.Thenext day we met Jenny, Jed’s wife and their two little boys, and Mary and Jennyinstantly bonded. We spent most of the day with them and then grabbed a napback at the Cheshire. And then, it was time to do the reading.Oneof the single best experiences of my life! If ever Jed Ayres calls you andinvites you to do a reading at Noir at the Bar, all I can say is I’d urge youto run with all possible haste and do so. This is the Valhalla of noir writers.A savage storm erupted just before the reading where a tornado touched down whatseemed like mere blocks from us and hail the size of golf balls rained down.Really—no exaggeration—golf balls!First,Cort read from his forthcoming novel, CAGEFIGHTERS, and then (a very funny) ErikLundy read from his story “Shootout at the KY Corral” (don’t ask…) and then weall took a break and it was my turn. I read my favorite short story, “In theZone” from THE BEST AMERICAN MYSTERY STORIES, and Cort told me I knocked it outof the park. Not to brag, but I agree.. We finished up with David James Keaton’sreading of his story “Three Abortions, which was maybe a little un-PCist... Youknow, people with no brains…Then,a bunch of noir gods showed up, including Scott Phillips, Frank Bill, MatthewMcBride and we started to get ripped. A bunch of us ended up going to hit thebar scene and the next thing I remember is getting up to meet Cort, Jed, Scott,Erik and others down at Jed’s café where the readers are held for breakfast.Getthis: Scott-frickin’-genius-Phillips came up to me and asked if he could readand blurb my next book, THE RAPIST! Did you catch that? He asked me! This is akinto Ted Williams  coming out of the dugoutto wave his cap.Theword before the reading was that Frank Bill was going to drop by with country singerlegend, Ray Wylie Hubbard, but while Frank showed up, alas, Mr. Hubbard wasunable to as he was shooting part of a video for his new release.Fora more coherent account of the goings-on, hop over to Jed’s blog at http://spaceythompson.blogspot.com/2012/04/doing-more-with-les.htmlwhere he tells what really went on. I think it was because he was more sober…Atthe end of the reading, we made another plea for votes for my nomination of THEBITCH for the best novel award in the Legends category.Thatdidn’t turn out as I’d hoped… Yeah, Lawrence Block won. Who’da thunk? But, itwas one of the biggest honors of my life to just be nominated. Next year… (Isound like a Cubs’ fan, don’t I…)Eventhough I didn’t win, a lot of my friend did and I’m truly delighted they did.It was deserved in all cases. One I was especially happy about was Anthony NeilSmith’s win for his brilliant novel, ALL THE YOUNG WARRIORS for best novel inthe Rising Star category. Congratulations, Doc Noir! This was one of the bestnovels I’ve read in a long, long while.WhenI got back, I was interviewed by Benjamin Sobieck for his blog and it turnedout to be one of the best interviews I’d ever had.

{"title": "FINDING YOUR VOICE available as an ebook!", "date": "Thursday, April 19, 2012", "text": "LAUNCH DAY!Hi folks,I’m extremely proud to announce the release of my first self-published book, FINDING YOUR VOICE: How to Put Personality in Your Writing. It’s up and available for sale on Amazon, Smashwords and other ebook outlets.Check it out here at: http://www.amazon.com/Finding-Your-Voice-Personality-ebook/dp/B007VEGNS6/ref=sr_1_cc_1?s=aps&ie=UTF8&qid=1334841824&sr=1-1-catcorrIt’s not exactly a self-published book. It came out in hardcover and paperback in 2003 from Writer’s Digest Books and eventually sold out. My agent, Chip Macgregor, requested the ebook rights from them and they graciously granted them and the result is the ebook is now available.We priced it at what we felt was a fair price--$4.99—which is half the price of the paperback version.We also changed the cover. I’d never liked the cover Writer’s Digest had provided and I saw this as an opportunity to come up with one I did like. I loved the cover they’d done on my second book for them—Hooked—and wanted to come up with something that would tie into that look. My nephew, Bo Goff—a very talented artist—came up with exactly what I wanted. The same blue background in Hooked and instead of the goldfish, he used a parrot. Get it? Hooked=fish; Voice=parrot. And, we needed to create a new press for this so I came up with… ready?... you guessed it. Blue Skies Books.I’m very proud of this book. It was my first writer’s how-to craft book and I saw it as a response to what I perceived as the single biggest obstacle to a writer getting published—not writing in their particular, original, unique voice. As an editor myself, I knew that to be the case. For more times than I could count, I read cover letters from writers that immediately triggered my “this guy/gal can write!” antenna, only to begin reading the manuscript itself, which seemed to be written by an entirely different author. An entirely different boring writer. They’d departed from that really cool voice that was their own in their letters to this… writerly person trying to impress.And it didn’t.What follows is from the introduction and lays out clearly how I came to write this book and why.Introduction I've written all my life (in my case, that began just about the same time as dinosaurs were put on the “endangered list”) and have also been privileged to teach several hundred writers of all levels and abilities as an online teacher of creative fiction writing in the famed UCLA Extension Writer's Program and these days for other venues. Even though I'd enjoyed success myself as a writer and teacher, I was much like most of my students—searching for a “secret” that would guarantee for my work the light of publication. I hunted along all the canyons and woodlands wherein such a secret might lie ... workshops, writing magazines, “how-to” books, queries to published authors I met… and so on. Even though I'd been published, I was still convinced that others met success without as much blood and sweat as I had. There just had to be some kind of “secret” Tim O'Brien and Kurt Vonnegut and Barbara Kingsolver weren't sharing—were holding close to the vest, so to speak.Well, there was.I discovered that secret in the most unlikely of places. In the Indiana state prison at Pendleton.In my wild and tempestuous youth, I had gone afoul of the law and ended up serving time in that institution. I'd come home from four years in the Navy, the last two spent in Bermuda, and just kind of went crazy “back home in Indiana.” I fell in with some other guys who were very pleased to let me go insane right along with them and ended up committing a bunch of burglaries and robberies and getting my very own personalized number on my blue denim state-issued shirt. They say you remember your social security number all your life, as well as your military number. Along with those numbers, I find it hard to forget an additional series of digits . . . #49028. That was my “personality” for the next couple of years.Decades later, having straightened up my own mess of an existence, I felt I owed something of a debt to the guys I'd left behind and so, a few years ago, I began to pay visits to the inmates downstate. I'd offer up my own life as proof that anyone can overcome the label of ex-con and go on to contribute to society rather than simply take from it.What began to happen was that after many of those visits, an inmate would write me a lengthy letter, telling me that he, too, had ambitions to become a writer and could I advise him on how to go about learning the craft. These letters would also go into great detail about how the unlucky incarcerate had personally been “bum-rapped on the litigous” (a term I coined in one of my short stories titled “Dream Flyer”, available in my collection titled Monday's Meal). The letters would tell marvelously-inventive stories of how society had dumped on the inmate and how it wasn't his fault that he found himself in a six-by-eight-foot cell, painted an unfashionable gray. A con job, but what good writing isn't?The thing was, these stories had all the elements of great fiction. They were rollicking, exhilarating tales of car chases, lawyerly ineptitude, shootouts, and judges they were convinced had been “fixed” or just politically motivated to be perceived by the voting public as “crime-fighters.” I might also add that many of the letters were rife with misspellings, along with grammatical and punctuation errors, but through all the slag and dross that might cause an English teacher to cringe, shone the unmistakable luster of literary gold. These guys were writers! I wrote each of them back, asking them to create for me a short story and we'd go from there.I felt like a budding Maxwell Perkins. I was “discovering” writers and would have a major hand in shaping their craft. At least one of these guys was going to emerge a major American author, when I was done. Eat your heart out, Normie Mailer—my cons were more better than yours ever were, dude…Not so. The stories I invariably got back could never possibly be matched to the authors of those original letters. In every single case, the author had opted to become ”writerly.” I could imagine the earnest tyro sitting on his bunk, hunched over a yellow legal pad, scribbling with a blue-capped Bic… with a Webster's Collegiate Dictionary and Random House Thesaurus open beside him. Plus a copy of a coverless Zane Grey glommed from the prison library's priceless collection. Instead of the stories so passionately expressed in their letters, I was given tales of rustlers in the Wild West and Sam Spade retreads in Los Angeles and ”Noo” York City… written in a hand unmistakable as an imitation of the original…The same thing happened when I began teaching for UCLA in the nineties. I'd get these great letters at the beginning of the class in response to the bios I asked for from my students… and then the stories that began to emerge utilized an entirely different voice.It dawned on me what had happened. Faced with writing something an “authority” (that would be moi…) would actually be reading (and judging), they had fled from their own natural, wondrous voices and succumbed to what I started to recognize as the “writer's inferiority complex.” An inferiority complex I began to see everywhere in beginning writers and even in some fairly-seasoned pros.As time went on and I began to teach more, I saw the malaise among beginning writers everywhere. Universally, it manifests itself in definite patterns.The writers afflicted with this most wretched of all writer's maladies almost always “hold themselves back” from their best writing (read: natural voice) because they approach their craft with overmuch respect for the published word and/or to satisfy the critical voices they hear in their heads from all the writing teachers or mentors they've had, and end up trying to create prose they feel is in what they see to be a “writerly” style.Instead of the very likable voice that is unique to each of them, they try to be a William Faulkner or a Sandra Cisneros clone, or, in the case of many of my inmate friends, a Zane Grey-ite, as well as for all those writing “authorities” sprinkled in their pasts, and in the process do much good for their mail carriers' end-of-year bonuses, keep the paper mill industry profitable and amass a significant collection of editor's rejection slips, but do little for their own careers.Some of these folks do get published, but many times only because they've learned how to be technically perfect. The piece of writing accepted didn't hit any of the editor's “hot” buttons, those buttons that allow them to get through that humongous pile of manuscripts staring at them from across the desk. The buttons I'm referring to are the “don't's” of writing, i.e., improper format, misspellings, grammatical mistakes, etc.Editors are busy folks and to get through the mass of manuscripts most use an internal checklist of “mistakes” to automatically reject a manuscript. If a story or an article makes it through that minefield, it sometimes gets published simply because it didn't hit any of those buttons or “mines.” As an editor of The Crescent Review, I would see stories like that being accepted every now and then. Sometimes, I wish we'd published the writers' cover letters instead, since those were in their natural voices and much more interesting reading.About that “natural voice…” The theory I've arrived at through these observations is that readers select certain authors to read in much the same way as they select their personal friends: on the basis of the “voice” (personality) of that person. All human beings in the world have a circle of people who like them and want to be around them… and they also have folks who don't like them all that much. The same is true of an author's readership. They are the “friends” he or she will accumulate. Contrary to what many think, I don't believe readers are attracted nearly so much to plots and characters as much as they are to the personality of the person regaling them on the page. The same holds true for nonfìction—a reader may initially be attracted because of the subject or to the basic “facts” revealed, but unless the author provides a personality to the material, many won't stick around till the end or will only read it because they’re forced to by a boss or a teacher.Which doesn't mean that every single person who picks up your article or story will be fascinated and mesmerized to the very last word, but lots more will than if you don't make the story or piece unmistakably yours and yours alone.Although some won't…That's not bad, folks. Just as in “real life” you don't honestly expect everyone to like you or want to join your “gang,” neither should you expect everyone who picks up your story or article or novel to feel a rapport with you. That's just not reasonable to expect. Don't worry about it whatsoever. You'll pick up lots more friends (readers) by being yourself than you will be by writing in a beige voice. Lots and lots more!What is reasonable for you to expect is that no matter how idiosyncratic or “different” your own, particular voice may be, there will be a number of readers who will lìkc it. Who will be drawn to the personality on the page.It's usually a mistake in any business to try to be “something to everyone,” and that's kind of what writing in a neutral or colorless voice is kind of doing. Trying not to offend by being so bland that the readers' emotions are left untouched.I think that's a mistake. By being yourself on the page, you'll more than likely attract more readers because of your individuality than you would by hiding your personality behind a neutral style. Consider the departed Howard Cosell. He got it right when he said he didn't care if viewers hated him or loved him… just so long as they watched him. In fact, for those of you too young to remember Howard or those of you who couldn't care a fig less about sports, there were vast legions of people who actively hated the man and his nasal voice and belligerent projection of superior attitude. Cosell-haters probably made up half his audience! He actively cultivated those folks and they helped pay his salary by tuning in and increasing his Nielsen numbers to be much, much higher than those numbers would have been if he'd been a more neutral and unbiased observer and commentator. Providing commentary in a “beige” voice, so-to-speak…Do you suppose everyone in America loves John Grisham's voice? Or Stephen King's voice? These are authors who are megasellers as we all know… and yet, there are lots and lots of readers who wouldn't dream of picking up their books. Think that bothers Grisham or King? Not on your life! They're very much aware that you can't be all things to all people. By developing their own personalities in their writing, they don't attract every single reader there is ... but, boy, do they attract a lot of others!And you will, too.Much of this writing thing is in the delivery. Professional comics realize this. They know all too well that two comedians can tell the same joke and one will get belly laughs and the other mute stares. Think about your own experience. Remember in the third grade when Joey Dultoid told a joke and everyone just stared at him and an hour later, in the lunchroom, Anna-Banana Smith told the very same joke... and had the gang hooting until they cried? Different personalities at work…Even though Joey bombed with one audience, however, chances are he was a hit with his own circle of friends, a different audience with different sensibilities. Kind of like authors and their readerships. Anna-Banana may be the Stephen King of the lunchroom and may enjoy a large and appreciative audience because she just happens to have the kind of personality that appeals to more people, but Joey also probably has an audience, albeit smaller. If Joey tried to imitate Anna-Banana's style of delivery, chances are not only would he fail to gain any fans in that group, he'd also lose his own audience, albeit smaller. Even if the number of people who enjoy his jokes is smaller, it's still an audience, one that would probably disappear if he tried to be something he wasn't.Kind of the same deal in writing.Employ your own personality and, to steal a popular saying that came from the movie, Field of Dreams, “they will come.” Be someone else on the page… and they won't.This is where I think many books on writing leave a hole in the advice given. Granted, it's vitally important to know the nuts and bolts of writing, but more importantly and universally neglected, is the tremendous role your personality plays when you arrange words and sentences. How you tell a story is at least as important as the content of that story and I contend it's quite possibly even more vital. The most important concept we can grasp as writers is sublime in its simplicity—to be yourself on the page\\And this is what the book you hold in your hands will concern itself with. Not only the critical importance of being yourself on the page instead of trying to emulate someone else or writing in a neutral voice, but also to offer up some concrete methods by which you can accomplish this goal.To discover that your own voice is desirable is incredibly liberating and empowering. It will bring out some of the best work you've ever done. Writing that has a much higher possibility of being published.In my own experience, ever since I've discovered this and incorporated my theories in my teaching, my students' efforts, without exception, have improved exponentially and perhaps even more important, the percentage of those getting their work published has risen dramatically. In my files, I have dozens of letters attesting to that from students who tell me my classes are head and shoulders above every other class they've ever taken and chiefly because I forever challenge them to find their own, unique voice. Now it's time to find yours.And that’s what Finding Your Voice is all about. Hope you pick up your own copy! If you like what you read, please consider posting a review and hitting the “Like” button. I’d appreciate it!Blue skies,LesP.S. Hope y'all all got a free copy of THE PERFECT CRIME when it was available as such. Looks like the promo worked well--it's selling like hotcakes now.

{"title": "CHARLES MANSON AND ME AND SOME HAPPY CHIT-CHAT WITH THE WORLD'S MOST-STABBED INMATE IN U.S. HISTORY...", "date": "Sunday, April 15, 2012", "text": "Hi folks,I thought you might be interested in a recent exchange I had with author Richard Godwin. Richard is interviewing me for his blog feature “Chin Wag at the Slaughterhouse.” It’s a fantastic feature, where he interviews authors and asks the most fascinating and “deepest” questions I’ve ever been asked by any interviewer. Richard is interviewing me at the suggestion of noir master, Paul D. Brazill, a mutual friend.Here's the link to his blog and his interviews. http://www.richardgodwin.net/blog Richard conducts his interviews by posing one question at a time. Once you respond to that question, he sends you another. It’s an exhausting process but when we’re done, it’ll be the most comprehensive interview I’ve ever had the pleasure of participating in. I’ll be sure to let you know when it appears.I had just sent him my reply to his second question and he sent me the third. When he emailed me, he asked me the question below and I thought you might be interested in the answer, since it’s about an old acquaintance, Charlie Manson, and I know there are people out there who are interested in Manson. (This isn’t the interview question—it’s just a personal question he asked in response to Paul Brazill’s suggestion that he do so as he knew the story and thought Richard might be interested.)Be advised there are a few instances of strong language.Here’s Richard Godwin’s question and my reply:Paul (D. Brazill) suggested I ask you about Manson. I do not mean to put you on the spot, this is not part of the interview. My first novel Apostle Rising was mentioned by a few reviewers in the context of the Manson killings, as this review showshttp://www.bookgeeks.co.uk/2011/03/23/apostle-rising-by-richard-godwin/All the bestRichard (Godwin).Hi Richard,Well, Charlie and I have a bit of a history.About ten years ago or so, a professor at the University of Toledo—Dr. Russell Riesling--was writing a book about the drug experiences of famous people during their youth. He had folks like Big Brother of Big Brother and the Holding Company and some other folks. For some weird reason, he had a chapter on me. I’d done drugs but definitely wasn’t famous!Anyway, Russ interviewed me for his book (which hasn’t been published yet, alas), and we became friends. I sent him a copy of my story collection, Monday’s Meal. About two weeks after I sent it, I got a phone call from him. Seems he’d been out to Corcoran Prison to visit with and interview Charles Manson (who also had a chapter), and during the visit, Charlie spotted the copy of Monday’s Meal that Russ had with him. He asked if he could “borrow it” and Russ loaned it to him. A few days later, he called Russ and was really excited (according to Russ). He said he’d read the book and loved it and that I was “the real deal” meaning a real-life outlaw, ex-con. He asked Russ if he’d ask me if I’d mind if he (Charlie) called me. I told Russ, sure, and thus began a series of phone calls from him to me.Now, when I was in prison, we weren’t allowed to call folks. At all. One of the many things that have changed. Because of that, I wasn’t aware that all such phone calls are made collect. At the end of the month, after which he called 3-4 times a week, I got the bill and it was astronomical! My wife had a cow and I told Charlie we needed to dial it back a bit. (Pun intended…)Mostly, Charlie talked and I listened. He’s not hard to figure out. He’s a nutcase, pure and simple. Knew lots of guys like him in the joint who just weren’t as famous. We swapped stories and he may have told me a few things he’d done that he hadn’t been nailed on and I may have returned in kind, but I won’t talk about that. Nothing incriminating on either of our part--they record these things! Anyway, I kind of got tired of talking to him—it was same-o, same-o all the time—and was about to disassociate myself, when he told me his cellmate, Roger Smith, really wanted to talk to me. I said okay and thus began a series of phone calls with Roger.Roger bills himself as the “most-stabbed inmate in U.S. history—and he is. As of that time, he’d been shanked over 300 separate times. The reason he was Charlie’s cellmate was that both were in protective custody as there were hits out on both of them from just about everybody in Corcoran. Over the years, Roger had hired himself out as a hit man for every single gang in the joint and now all of them had a hit out on him. The reason he wanted to connect with me was that he thought I was a “great writer” (his words and they had little effect on me—I’ve been on the receiving end of a shuck job attempt more than once…), and he wanted me to write his life story. According to Roger, he’d had his “come to Jesus” moment and wanted to right all the wrongs in his life. He said he wanted his life story out there to help keep young kids from following in his footsteps. He’d been locked up ever since he was a juvie and all that. Grew up in one joint or another.I had to laugh when he told me he was “saved.” He sounded contrite… but every other word out of his mouth with “fuck this” or “motherfucker that” and he didn’t sound much like the converts I’d met down at the First Baptist… But, I’ve been inside with a lot of guys who had these jailhouse conversions and he wasn’t unusual.He told me Charlie was letting him use his personal secretary—some gal who lives in North or South Carolina (forget which) who has all of Charlie’s journals and communications and writings and such and who handles all his commercial business. He can’t profit by books and interviews but he does take checks from the networks and publishers and the proceeds all go to charity. Roger told me he’d kept journals from when he was a little tad tyro outlaw and they were with Charlie’s secretary and he said he’d have her send them to me—from what he said, a LOT of journals(!)--and that he’d answer any questions I asked.I told him I was just too busy with my own work and really couldn’t do this project, but he wouldn’t take no for an answer. Called me incessantly, trying to persuade me to write his life history. Finally, one time, he said, “What’s the real reason you don’t want to write it, Les?” I asked him if he wanted the real reason and he said yeah, so I told him. “Roger,” I said, “you’re like a serial killer. In fact, you are a serial killer. Three hundred hits, dude.” “Yeah,” he said. “and why would that prevent you from writing my story?” To which I answered that serial killers just flat-out bored me (and they do). I told him serial killers just keep doing the same exact thing, over and over and over, ad nauseam. After about the third one, they’re just boring. And, I didn’t want to tie up a year of my life on writing about some boring-ass serial killer. I mean, how many ways can you write the same old scene?There was a silence and then he exploded. Called me everything nasty he could think of. Sounded like he’d kind of backslid on the “saved” deal. Screamed that if he ever got out of Corcoran my house was the first place he was heading. I listened to him ranting and screaming at me and then said, “Roger?” He got quiet and then said, “Yeah?” I said, “Roger, you’re not ever getting out of there unless there’s a major earthquake and the walls fall down and that isn’t likely. But, if somehow you do get out, I’m aware that you prefer using a shank on your hits and if you come to my house to nail me, I won’t have a shank. It’ll be something that makes a louder noise. So, it’s been nice talking to you and have a nice life, loser.”And that’s the last I’ve talked to either Roger to Charlie. But, for awhile we were all jam.So that’s the story of me and Charlie Manson, Richard.Les Hope you enjoyed this little anecdote, folks. And, if you haven’t read Richard Godwin’s books you really should. They’re fantastic.Here’s a link to his latest, Mr. Glamour.

{"title": "MAEGAN BEAUMONT--GIVE HER SOME LOVE!", "date": "Wednesday, April 4, 2012", "text": "Hi folks,I want to introduce you to a friend of mine--Maegan Beaumont--and ask you to check out her new blog and join if you like what you see.You will find it at http://maeganbeaumont.blogspot.com/ Maegan has been a student of mine for a couple of years now. She's on her 7th or 8th class with me--not sure--time flies by! At this point, she administers the class for me, along with another terrific writer, Linda Thompson, although Linda has pretty well turned over the job to Maegan.. Maegan has a special place in my heart as she spent nine weeks in what the folks who take my class refer to as \"inciting incident hell.\" Maegan holds the record by a long way!Nine weeks! Out of a 12-week class. Here's what it amounts to. In my classes, students have to create a proper beginning for their novels before they're allowed to proceed. That means they have to write a scene with the inciting incident as that's where novels need to begin today. When the trouble begins. And, that's with the inciting incident. Each student is allowed to send in up to five pages until they escape inciting incident hell. Most spend several weeks there--that's the norm. It means that until they graduate what they've reduced to shorthand as \"Inc Inc\" they have to keep rewriting that first five pages until they've created a bona fide inciting incident. That means that Maegan spent over two months--nine weeks--writing five pages over and over. And over...Most would have given up in half that time or less. Not Maegan! She's tough and she's persevering and  there's no quit in her.Get this. When she began the first class with me, she had a finished novel, and was sending it out to agents and publishers. A 700-page novel...(That novel is long gone... It's in a drawer somewhere, I understand...) She confessed later that she hated me. I can't say I was surprised. If I'd been in her place I probably would have hated me as well. Probably more than she did.But, she stuck it out! She's a fighter and she's one of the people I want in my foxhole.Since that long-ago class, she's finished a publishable novel and has secured an agent and is on her way to what I feel are going to be huge successes in writing. She writes thrillers and has a protagonist that students in our classes say \"out-Reacher Jack Reacher.\" Her Sabrina is a kick-ass bad ass who you wouldn't want to get on your bad side...She's also the master of plotting. That's what she's basing her blog on--plotting. So, if you have questions or issues about your own novel's plot, run on over to Maegan's blog and ask her. More, she's just an inspiration to me and everyone who knows her and has worked with her. Check her out and I think you'll agree. Oh, yeah... Maegan began writing her second novel in our present class and breezed through the inciting incident. She's also breezing through this novel and it's a winner. As she's learned, the things you learn in creating a quality beginning carry through the entire of the novel. The rest of the novel becomes infinitely easier to write if you just take the things you've learned in that endeavor and apply them to the rest of it.Blue skies,LesP.S. And, since you're already on the 'puter, once you check out Maegan's blog, consider heading over to the Spinetingler Magazine voting booth and vote for my own novel, THE BITCH, which is a nominee for Best Novel in the Legends category. You'll find it at http://www.spinetinglermag.com/2012/03/31/2012-spinetingler-award-voting/THANKS!"},

{"title": "CHARACTER ACTIONS", "date": "Tuesday, March 20, 2012", "text": "HI folks,I'm writing a new writer's how-to book, and I thought I'd share a sample chapter with you to get your feedback and also to helpfully give you some tools in your fiction writing. Still looking for a publisher, but may end up publishing it myself. Not sure at this point. Anyway, hope you enjoy the excerpt and get a bit of usefulness out of it:  A FICTION WRITER’S WORKSHOP AT THE BIJOUByLes Edgerton  CHAPTER ONEDefining characters and their arcsby their physical actions            I think you’ll find this chapter alone worth the price of admission to our little “theater” between the covers. The writer who can master the art and craft of defining their characters by their actions is going to be the author whose work gets read. By lots and lots of folks… Enough, hopefully, that you’ll never again have to say to someone about the novel you’ve written that it’s “only available in my room.”*A common fault of fiction writers in defining their characters and their character arcs is by neglecting to use one of the most powerful methods available. The technique? Namely, by showing the reader the nature of their character by the physical actions the writer chooses to provide their characters with. Precisely what countless writing gurus have been talking about for eons when they urge their students to: “Show, don’t tell.”Movie people do this better than almost anyone. We can learn a lot from those Hollywood folks!            Most of us as fiction writers flesh out our characters with the use of description, via dialogue, by the interior thoughts of characters and by similar methods. All of these are good techniques and work well in the short story and novel. However, if the author ignores the use of using physical actions to help create their characters and to also show how they’ve evolved due to the events that happen along the way in the story (that character arc us writing teachers are always talking about), they’re missing what can be the most powerful tool of all. This is an area we can really make our novels come alive and impact the reader on a much deeper level.The use of description is perhaps the weakest of the novelist’s tools in terms of character description. What of the following makes more of an impact in the reader’s mind? To read: “Elizabeth was an arthritic old woman.” Or, to read: Elizabeth labored up the stairs, a painful step at a time. She paused at each step, grasped the handrail with both hands and forced her ancient legs up yet another step. The second example wins, hands-down. Why? Because we “see” an action the character takes and because we see it happening it has an emotional impact on us. In the first example, we’re “told” what the character is (arthritic). Doesn’t make much of an impression at all. Not even close to the impression we get when we see her inching painfully up the stairs.This is important enough that I’ll say it again: Characters are defined best and on a deeper level by their actions. As are their character arcs. You know, that deal where the character emerges at the end of the story a different person than when the story began as a result of all they’d gone through during the course of the tale. Why? Because they experience what the character does and what the character experiences at the same time the character does. They’re not being “told” this character has undergone a sea change—they “see” it with their own eyes, and are therefore convinced to a degree not remotely possible with the author “telling” them there’s been a change via their thoughts or any of the other aforementioned techniques.            A movie that illustrates brilliantly how all this can be accomplished through the character’s actions is screenwriter Callie Khouri’s Thelma & Louise. We’ll be looking closely at this film in this chapter and others, as it’s one of those rare movies that provide many, many teaching moments that can be valuable to fiction writers.            The basic plot of Thelma & Louise, is that two friends plan to go on a weekend getaway fishing in the mountains. On the way there, they stop at a roadhouse for a quick drink or two and Thelma gets sexually attacked by Harlan in the parking lot. Louise saves her friend by putting a gun to Harlan’s head just as he’s trying to penetrate Thelma. Situation defused, Harlan just has to say one last insult and Louise shoots and kills him. The women flee the scene and the rest of the movie is basically a chase scene, ending with the women opting for suicide rather than to go prison.            The plot is fairly simple on the surface, but the characterizations Khouri has created of these people make this an extremely complex film. What is magnificent about their characterizations is that they are each revealed chiefly through their actions. Virtually every single line in the script and every moment on the screen can be studied to your gain. I’ve watched this movie more than a hundred times and each time learned something new, both from the script Khouri has created and from the brilliant work these talented actors  and the director Ridley Scott bring to the project.First, let’s look at the physical actions Khouri has given to character Thelma (as played by Geena Davis) which define her character and brilliantly carry the viewer through as she transforms into a “new” person at the end. Louise is also given actions to define her character and arc, but we’ll mostly be looking at Thelma’s. Once you’ve read this, then the script, and then watched the movie, take an extra step and go back and see how Louise’s actions inform her character as well.The setup            We’ll begin with the “setup.” The structure of movies used to be that roughly the first ten minutes served as the “setup.” This is where the principle characters are introduced and we learn who they are and what their situation is and the inciting incident and story problem are dramatized. This is one of those things that have changed in the last few years. Setup time has been drastically reduced in more and more movies and is fast becoming a thing of the past.            In the beginning of the setup of Thelma & Louise, there are a series of intercuts between the dual protagonists. We see Louise (played by Susan Sarandon) at her work—slinging hash in a Denny’s-type restaurant. We see Thelma at home with her emotionally-abusive and immature husband Darryl (played by Stephen Tobolowsky), a guy who’s transcended the role of male chauvinist pig to that of male chauvinist hog.            What actions does she perform that define her character? The very first one is her dialogue with Louise. The movie opens with Louise at a pay phone at the restaurant calling Thelma, asking her if she’s ready to leave on her trip. Here’s the way it looks in the script.Louise(at pay phone)I hope you’re packed, little sister, ‘cause we are outtahere tonight.(By the way, when Louise calls her “little sister,” this also defines their relationship. As you’ll see, Louise begins in an almost “mother” role and Thelma as the child and in the very first line of dialogue in the movie, Khouri has already begun to define that relationship.)            Thelma responds with her first dialogue, which likewise immediately begins to define her character.INT. THELMA’S KITCHEN—MORNING Thelma(whispering guiltily)                        Well, wait now. I still have to ask Darryl if I can go.            Right off the bat, we can tell from what she says to Louise that she’s one of those “dutiful little wives.” We don’t know at this point if Darryl is her boyfriend or husband, but we do know from what she says that she feels she has to get permission from him, and that bespeaks volumes about their relationship, whichever it is.            But, as Louise answers her offscreen on the phone, and we hear Louise’s voice, Khouri gives Thelma a great piece of “actor’s business” (action) that really shows her character and where she’s at in her relationship with Darryl. Here’s Khouri’s action for her character (italics mine):Thelma has the phone tucked under her chin as she cuts out coupons from the newspaper and pins them on a bulletin board already covered with them. We see various recipes torn out from women’s magazines along the lines of “101 Ways to Cook Pork.”            If that action doesn’t show us who Thelma is and what kind of person she is, nothing ever will! In less than fifteen seconds on the screen, Khouri has given us both a bit of dialogue and a specific action that deliver us a three-dimensional character and speaks volumes about who she is.            Then, after she hangs up from her conversation with Louise, Thelma goes to the bottom of the stairs, leans on the banister, and yells up, “Darryl! Honey, you’d better hurry up!”            Again, with dialogue, she’s shown she’s the dutiful little wife, pandering to her husband almost as if he was a little child and she the mom urging him to get up. You can just tell that this is a daily routine and that she has to be the “mom” to her husband… and we get all this before we even see Darryl. By her dialogue and by her actions. All in about thirty seconds.            Darryl makes his appearance and Khouri defines his character also by his actions. First, by the way he’s dressed and the way he acts. Khouri gives him this appearance: Darryl comes trotting down the stairs. Polyester was made for this man and he’s dripping in “men’s” jewelry.            She further defines his character by his response to Thelma’s urging him to “hurry up.” He says, “Dammit, Thelma, don’t holler like that! Haven’t I told you I can’t stand it when you holler in the morning.”            Less than a minute has gone by in the story and we’ve already got a crystal-clear view of these two people and of their relationship. Thelma then replies (sweetly and coyly), I’m sorry, doll, I just didn’t want you to be late.”            Next, Khouri provides the character of Darryl with a very revealing bit of action, when she writes: Darryl is checking himself out in the hall mirror and it’s obvious he likes what he sees. He exudes overconfidence for reasons that never become apparent…He is making imperceptible adjustments to his overmoussed hair. (Then, another action by Thelma that further defines her character. Italics mine.) Thelma watches approvingly.            In the briefest span of time, we see these two people for exactly who and what they are. All delivered via their actions (mostly) and a bit of dialogue.            Louise's character is defined even before Thelma's, in the very first scene. She's waiting tables and one of her \"tops\" has a group of teenaged girls, whom she admonishes for smoking, citing the well-worn chestnut that \"smoking will stunt your growth.\" This action informs us of her character and role in the movie—that of the mother. Immediately after she's chastised the girls, she goes into the kitchen for a break and has a cigarette herself. Not only does it define her mothering character, it shows us that she's an unreliable character. She preaches one thing but does another. Pretty much what a normal parent might do!            Also, each woman has an action that defines both their individual characters and their relationship to each other. Louise is smoking—an “adult” action. In the intercuts, Thelma is chewing on a candy bar—a “child’s” action. As the story unfolds, Thelma will abandon the candy bar and take up smoking as she moves closer to adult status.            There are countless other examples of how Callie Khouri defines each and every character by their action—virtually everything the people in her story does defines their characters. There isn’t any “actor’s business for the sake of actor’s business” anywhere in the script. These aren’t things they just “do” while delivering their lines. They do serious plot and story work.            Let’s move on.Guns to create character arch            Tools and how characters use them are very effective ways to create a character's growth. In Thelma and Louise, one of the most important actions Khouri uses to deliver Thelma’s character arc in the story is when the two women meet at Thelma’s house to begin their trip. Thelma has elected to bring along a revolver and it’s the way she physically handles it that is a particularly brilliant piece of writing by Khouri. Thelma picks up the gun gingerly by the thumb and two fingers, obviously terrified of the weapon when she takes it out of the drawer to pack. That action is reinforced when, minutes later, she reveals to Louise she's brought the weapon and she again holds it as if she's afraid it will go off and shoot her when she follows Louise's order and puts it in the older woman's purse. By the end of the story, she’s whipping the gun around like Doc Holliday’s been mentoring her out behind the O.K. Corral. This one simple action and the way it evolves during the story by itself beautifully shows the viewer how far Thelma’s come and how she’s emerged as a much different person as a result of what she’s undergone.Smoking to show character arc            However, Khouri doesn’t use just this one action to create a character arc for Thelma. Smoking is another one. We've already talked about Louise toking on a cigarette after she's admonished the teenagers for smoking. At the beginning of the trip, Thelma pantomimes smoking an unlit cigarette, imitating the older and more world-weary Louise. The action is of a child, imitating an adult. As events progress, she eventually becomes a true pro, chain-smoking to beat the band and looking like she’s been at it since she was twelve and a half.            The physical action of smoking is used in many places in this movie to symbolize important points. For instance, after their money has been stolen by J.R. (played by Brad Pitt), Louise has completely given up. Rather than “tell” us she’s quit the good fight, via some awkward dialogue, Khouri uses the physical action of smoking to show us. Waiting in the car, while Thelma goes into a convenience store/gas station (which she’s going to hold up, unbeknownst to Louise), she lights up, takes a desultory half-drag and then tosses the cigarette away. More than any dialogue ever could, this simple action of resignation shows the audience exactly the level of despair Louise has sunk to. She’s given up the only pleasure she had left in life (smoking). A second or two later, she takes out a tube of lipstick and begins to apply it, almost as a lifelong habit in her role as a “woman,” only to toss that away as well. Hard on the heels of giving up smoking, she’s now given up any pretense of being what society deems a woman should be as well as her very life, symbolically. With these two simple actions, we are completely convinced of the complete despair Louise feels. She’s stripped bare of everything. Her old life and old person is gone. It's at this point that she begins to achieve true independence. Only by giving up her old life can she proclaim her right to freedom from the tyranny she's lived under all of her life... from men in particular and from society in general.Packing            In the setup, both women pack for their camping trip to the mountains. There is a vast contrast to their packing \"styles\" which serves to further define their characters by that action. Louise, the \"mom\" is in control. She wraps garments in individual plastic containers and arranges them neatly in her suitcase. Thelma, in contrast, throws handfuls of clothes into her suitcase and at one point, just dumps her drawers into her suitcase. She's definitely not in control of her life, as evidenced by her chaotic packing method. It mirrors her existence, just as Louise's style does hers. If you knew nothing about either woman, as soon as you saw each of them pack, you'd make the firm conclusion that one was in complete charge of herself and the other was more than a little \"scattered.\" You wouldn't have to hear either of them speak or do anything else to figure this out.            Over and over, actions show us both women and how they evolve. In the beginning, Louise is not only a control freak, she's also obsessed with cleanliness. In fact, there's a scene when the antagonist Hal (played by Harvey Keitel) breaks into Louise's apartment runs his finger over a table surface, looking for dust and there isn't any.            Another scene that reinforces her neatness jones, is when the women are waiting for drovers to get a herd of cattle around them. \"Don't you scratch my car!\" Louise screams at the men. Later, when they've achieved their freedom, her car is dirty, dusty and just downright filthy... and she doesn't even notice it. Evidence again that her character has evolved.Hair            Huh? you say. (I heard you.) How is hair a physical action?            Let's take a look.            Remember at the beginning, Khouri has established Louise as the \"in-control\" mother (adult) figure and Thelma as the scattered, undisciplined \"child.\" Louise packs carefully; Thelma tosses her things willy-nilly into the suitcase. Louise smokes; Thelma chomps on a candy bar. Thelma is terrified of guns and Louise is an old hand at firearms. And so on.            Now, look at their hair when the trip begins. Louise's is neat and pinned up. Under firm control. Thelma's hangs loose and free. Hair is important in this movie. Not only does it reflect the individual character at the moment, it also reveals the state of the relationship between the two women at a given point in the plot.            As the story progresses, Louise's hair begins to come down at various plot points. As she inches closer and closer to her freedom from men, the hair comes down, little by little. I won't go into every single scene where hair plays a role, although it does in just about all of them—watch the movie and focus only on the hair and the times when it is up or down or in-between on each woman and you can quickly see how hair affects what's going on and the present state of their relationship with each other.            There is a point, two-thirds through the film, when the two women reverse their roles. Thelma becomes the mother, the one in control, and Louise reverts to being a helpless child. Shortly after that, the two begin to move toward equality and their hair symbolically reflects that stage perfectly, in that both women are driving down the road and both have their hair partly \"up\" in the exact same \"do.\" Not only that, but to further strengthen their new-found equality, they are both singing along in perfect harmony to a song on the radio. All actions.Spitbath            Let's imagine a hypothetical scene. A mother has just picked up her little girl at the playground and they have to be at the girl's best friend's house for her birthday party. The woman's daughter has grime on her face from the dusty playground. What does the mother do? Why, she gives her a spitbath, of course. That's just what moms do! I know from (painfully embarrassing) personal experience. Who among us hasn't been an actor in this familiar drama!            Look at the scene immediately following the killing of Harlan. They're fleeing the scene and then Louise orders Thelma to pull over. Thelma's got gore on her cheeks from the bloody nose Harlan gave her when he hit her during his attempted rape. What does Louise do? (After she throws up of course, and re-enters the car, ordering Thelma back ot the passenger side.) She gives her a spitbath, an action right out of Parenting 101! You can find it on page three.Sex            I saw your eyes light up at this topic heading. Don't deny it. Just means you're normal.            Sex is powerful, isn't it. We pay attention when we encounter sex on the screen or among the pages of a novel.            Many writers write sizzling sex scenes that are definitely worth the price of admission. But... most of the time, those scenes don't do all that they could. Khouri gets Prius mileage out of her big sex scene, the one where Thelma and J.R. (Brad Pitt) make love. As Janet Burroway tells us in her wonderful book, Writing Fiction (the most widely-used writing textbook used in America and the best, in my opinion), that character changes must always be occasioned by a physical event, Khouri uses this maxim brilliantly.            Up until the point when J.R. steals their money, Louise is in charge—the parent—and Thelma is the child. When they run to the motel room and find out J.R.'s stolen all their money, a role reversal takes place. Louise gives up and reverts to being the child—all hope is gone in her eyes. It is then that a miracle happens. Thelma becomes the parent in charge. (Incidentally, this scene is foreshadowed by an earlier scene in a similar motel room, when Thelma collapses on the bed in tears, clearly the child, and Louise takes charge.)            How can Thelma change this drastically? Remember, character change must be caused by something physical that happens to the character. Have you guessed what the physical action was that allowed Thelma to do a 180?            Sex.            That's right. But... not just any old sex. After all, she's been married four years and has had lots of sex. But, what J.R. and she had was a different kind of sex for her. It was adult, mature sex. Not the version of teenager backseat dalliances she engaged in with her husband. No, this was grownup sex. And, it was because of this that she transformed into an adult and was able to take charge. Without this kind of sex, she would no doubt have stayed the child she was and would have most likely collapsed in surrender and defeat on the bed right along with Louise, as she'd already done in previous scenes in one way or another up to that moment.            This is the biggest turning point in the movie and the most dramatic moment and Khouri does it up right. First, she makes sure Thelma's defining moment isn't obscured by anything. Louise leaves their room first and it's clear she's going to be having sex with her boyfriend Jimmy (the Michael Madsen character). But... we never see even a glimpse of these two between the sheets doing the nasty. Why? Because Khouri wanted to make sure that the most important scene in the story wasn't obscured or overshadowed  in the least which it might have been if we'd been witness to both women and their lovemaking.            There are other actions in this fine film that the screenwriter Khouri employs, but these should give you a very good idea of not only how to use such actions to inform your character and his or her developmental arc, but how vital providing them is.            Now. How might we use these techniques for our fiction? Good question! Here's some suggestions.Proscription            Since Thelma & Louise first hit the movie theaters in 1987, the country has undergone a rather negative change in its attitude toward smoking. That means that it's probably best not to adopt Khouri's ingenious use of cigarettes in your story in an anti-smoking climate. What's kind of interesting is that while smoking has mostly vanished from movies, when it does appear, mostly it signals that this is a \"bad guy.\" Instead of wearing black, the villain these days is puffing on a Marlboro Red. What might you substitute? Well, there are any number of possibilities.            Let's say you're writing a coming-of-age novel or at least a novel with coming-of-age elements and you want something like Khouri's symbol to show the passage of your character from childhood into adulthood. What are some artifacts or actions that we associate primarily with adults and not with children?            One that comes to mind is drinking. If you watched the movie, you'll recall how Khouri has Thelma buying whiskey in those little \"miniatures\" when she was in her role as a child. That's how a kid might buy booze. When she \"grew up\" she switched to regular-sized bottles. To show your character as achieving adulthood you might show her switching from flavored vodkas to regular martinis, or you might set him up by having him order drinks mixed with colas—say a rum and Coke—to a Jack and water. (Although there seem to be plenty of adults who still enjoy pop in their adult beverages...) A better example might be having your character always running around in t-shirts with athletes' names on the back. To show he's achieved maturity, you could have him toss his Michael Jordan tees and begin wearing shirts without logos or jocks' names on the back. I heard a radio dj commenting on this one day and open it up for discussion among his listeners and the consensus reached was that after the age of thirty, a man just looks silly walking around with another guy's name on his shirt.            The point is to be observant and see what actions kids make that adults don't. In one of my short stories, \"Blue Skies,\" the protagonist experienced an epiphany when he noticed that his mentally-challenged daughter Celsi still ate her sandwiches that were cut diagonally by taking the first bite from the center. He knew she was never going to get better when he and his wife and Celsi were out for her sixteenth birthday and she still took her first bite out of the middle. His observation was that most adults he observed always bit the tip of the sandwich off first.            There are plenty of examples around. Just be observant and you'll find them.            And don't limit yourself to just coming-of-age actions. Use actions for every significant change in your character. For instance, you may want to write a story about a man who has terminal cancer and your story is about the stages such a person might go through in coming to terms with his fate.            Let's say that right after \"Charley\" learns of his impending doom, he goes through a period of utter hopelessness. From that he segues into a kind of hysterical hedonism, where he does everything he's always wanted to do, but was too conservative to do while healthy. From that you may have him moving on to a period in which he takes huge risks with his life. Maybe you have him buy a motorcycle—something he's always wanted but didn't for a couple of reasons. One, he was simply afraid of motorcycles, and two, he didn't feel the family's budget could accommodate one. Now that he's only got months to live, he races out and plunks down a check for a new Harley Sportster. His wife is beside herself. He tears through town at breakneck speed, at little or no concern for his safety. She's really worried because he refuses to buy a helmet. She even goes out and buys him one for his birthday present, but he never puts it on.            And then, something happens. He has an epiphany. (What the epiphany is and how he gets it is your job—you didn't think I was going to write the whole darned thing, did you?) Something happens that somehow gives him hope and makes him come back to earth and realize that even though he's terminal, he's still responsible for his family and that if he were to get in a wreck and survive, the hospital bills might just finish off what little savings they have left. He also gains a small ray of hope that the doctors may be wrong—that he may somehow beat the death sentence.            To show his realization by a physical act, you can have him go to the garage where he's discarded his wife's present and strap on the helmet. He's really grown here, by this kind of action. He didn't revert to where he was before—he's still going to ride his cycle and he isn't overly afraid to do so—but he's going to do it responsibly now.             See how this physical action stuff works? It's kind of cool, isn't it!            Now. Go out and figure out your own actions to give your characters to both reveal their character and to create their character arc. Your stories will resonate as they never have before. Hope this helps! The final version of this chapter will be a lot longer as there are dozens and dozens of actions Callie Khouri has employed to create character definition and arc. These are representative of her genius.Blue skies,Les"},

I talk about hiring and firing agents and the response has been super. Bri just told me the post had over 485 hits in a 24-hour period, so it looks as if it's interesting to some.Please join in the conversation going on there.Alas, as you probably know, Jake and the JUST LIKE THAT team made it to the Elite Eight but no further in the Spinetingler Magazine Novel Tourney. I don't feel that badly about it... well, maybe a little... because some dynamite books beat me out. It was an honor to even be included in the tourney and to make it that far was super.The good news is that we made enough on our winnings for our intrepid head cheerleader, Sandi, that she was able to get her much-needed botox treatment. The bad news is that we weren't able to earn enough for her to obtain the NoMoHair Dipilitory Wonder Machine she so desperately needed to treat her tragic condition of Excessive Hair Gene. Hank is still being called upon to shave her back hair every Friday night.UPDATE! We've just learned that Hank has proposed to Sandi and they're going to get married in Marina Del Rey! It turns out, Hank has learned to love Sandi's backhair and was secretly happy he was going to continue in his capacity as her Personal Shaver. There will be an article appearing in the next issue of People Magazine, with a heartwarming photo of the couple, standing in shallow water at Santa Monica, both digging their toes into the sand and staring soulfully out to sea, thinking what we all know are thoughts of love. Good going, Hank and Sandi! We love you guys!The word is, that after the wedding ceremony, everyone will be invited back to their suite at the Wyndham Bel Age to witness Hank ministering a Bic to Sandi's back. Complimentary champagne to all the attendees!And, Jake still hasn't been spotted after we placed in the Elite Eight. We're all praying he shows up at the nuptials. Last seen, he was stumbling down the block in the direction of the Gin Mill. One can only guess what happened there...See ya on Bri's blog!Blue skies,Les"},
{"title": "ELITE EIGHT!", "date": "Tuesday, March 6, 2012", "text": "Hi folks,JUST LIKE THAT just advanced to the Elite Eight in the Spinetingler Magazine novel tourney!All kinds of news to report!First, a recap of the game that advanced the JUST LIKE THAT squad to the next level. Just as we thought, Jake didn’t show up. At first, that is. The last anyone had seen him, two nights ago, he was heading out for the bar scene to celebrate his winning shot that got the team into the Sweet Sixteen. Knowing Jake, we figured that would be the last time we’d see him.But…With eight seconds left in the game, our intrepid coach who is NOT named Bob Knight, called time out. Tie game, the possession with the other team. Just as he’s about to send us back on the court, guess who walks in, dressed in his uni?You guessed it!!!Jake!!!Coach immediately yanks Bud and has Jake report to the scorer’s table. The ref handed the ball to our opponent’s point guard and he passed it in to their big star. He drove to just under the basket where Jake was now standing and started to go up and lay it in. And that’s when Jake won the game for us! Instead of going up to try to block the shot—which any ordinary lame-o basketball player would have done—Jake pulls the genius play we all have back on the playground but were afraid to use in a “real” game. Which was… ready?... you guessed it! He yanked the star’s shorts down!The poor guy was so flustered, he muffed the dunk, clanking it off the rim. Well, you should have seen Sandi, our intrepid head cheerleader! She screamed so loud a window in the upper levels of the gym shattered. Later, she revealed she’d seen her dreams of a botox operation sliding out of the picture. The scream froze everyone in the gym—players, refs, fans. Little kids running up and down the aisles pestering everyone. Everybody but one guy. You guessed it. Jake. Jake had heard Sandi scream so often in their past dating days that he didn’t even hear her. While everyone else froze in place, he grabbed the ball, raced—well, “raced” perhaps isn’t the right word—after all, he was hungover—he race-walked to the other end and laid it up. Well, “race-walked” perhaps isn’t the most accurate description either. He kind of stumbled to the other end…Victory.Pandemonium.And now Jake’s disappeared again. Last anyone saw him, he was heading for his favorite haunt, the Gin Mill, down on State Street.But, we’re in the Elite Eight!So, once again we’re asking for your support. If you can tear yourself away from that Budweiser and the DVD of Debbie Does Dallas and Dallas Retaliates By Renaming Itself Fort Worth, which you’ve already watched 6,000 times, go on over to the voting polls at http://www.spinetinglermag.com/2012/03/06/tournament-of-2011-crime-fiction-ebooks-elite-8/ and cast a vote for JUST LIKE THAT.More is at stake here than just a win for the Gipper. Well, duh… The Gipper’s dead, boobies…But, Sandi, isn’t. As it turns out, she needs more than just that botox operation. Poor Sandi revealed to us last night at the victory party, that she has a deep, dark secret and asked for our aid in helping her overcome what is a serious disability, especially in her regular job, which is as a stripper at the Kitty-Kat Klub. As it turns out, Sandi is the victim of “Excessive Hair Gene.” Which means… again, you guessed it(!) she has lots of body hair. Especially on her back and shoulders. Some on her chest… She confessed last night—admittedly after a number of mimosas—that her weekly Bic budget alone totaled three figures a week. Plus, she has to hire a guy to shave it for her every Friday night. Which has the ancillary effect losing that guy as a member of her dating pool. She tried to put a brave face on her horrible condition, trying to paint us a upbeat picture of her on those Friday night seshes, sitting in her bathtub in tepid water, rose petals strewn about in the water, and Hank her Personal Shaver, sitting there on the side of the tub, whacking away at her mossy back with a Lady Schick. But, it was easy to see past the courageous smile she tried to create, to see the real pain in her eyes, as she trusted us with this intensely personal and tragic condition.If we can somehow win at the next level and advance to the Final Four, our winnings will be enough that we can rescue Sandi and send her and Hank to East St. Louis to the factory for intensive and up-close-and-personal training on the NoMoHair Dipilitory Wonder Machine.If you knew Sandi like we do, you’d drop everything you’re doing and rush out and vote. As Sandi so often says, quoting one of her heroines, Anne Frank, “How wonderful it is that nobody need wait a single moment before starting to improve the world.”How true!You can do exactly that, by voting for JUST LIKE THAT.

It’s his fault the insides of my eyeballs feel like sandpaper and I’m on my fifth cup of coffee and it’s only 6:30 ayem.I fully intended to go to sleep at my normal beddy-bye time, Didn’t work out. Why? Because I picked up his danged novel, A Taste of Old Revenge. I picked it up to get to sleep. Read a few pages and drift off…Didn’t happen. Couldn’t put it down. Had to go downstairs to finish as my wife kept complaining about the light being on and keeping her awake. Now, I’m not only exhausted from no sleep, but my joints ache from the torture instrument that is our couch.Sounds like I’m complaining, right? Well, I’m not. It was worth it and I’d do it all over again. In fact, I have. I’m reading it for a second time. It’s that good.I love crime novels and I love the guys who can really write ‘em—guys like Raymond Chandler, and Joseph Wambaugh and Ed McBain. And, B.R. Stateham. He’s right there in that wonderful canon.I’ll leave it to others to describe the plot. I just want to let you know that this is just one terrific story. You’ll meet two old-style detectives—Turner and Frank--who don’t solve their crimes via computers and the Internet, but mostly by old-fashioned sleuthing and honest shoe leather. If you like vintage cars, this is your book. If you like delicious little literary inside asides… like a couple of mick cops named… ready?... Flannery and O’Connor… this is your kind of a read. If you like novels where you think you’ve figured it out and then a twist occurs that blows that all to hell… this is your kind of novel. If you like novels where the cops find a naked body in a snowdrift that the coroner discovers died from a fall from a great height and there’s not a building higher than a single story where he’s found, this is your kind of book. If you like your novels peopled with Nazi assassins, the FBI, the Russian Odessa, and the Israeli Mossad, then this is your kind of novel.Best of all, you’ll meet two cops who aren’t the stereotypical “good cop—bad cop.” Both of these guys are good guys. Just up against it. Big-time. You’re gonna like ‘em both. Like the guy on those ads for the Men’s Warehouse says (paraphrased slightly):Get this novel and read it. I guarantee you’re gonna like it.And tonight, I’m waiting until three in the morning and then I’m going to phone Mr. Stateham. Wake his butt up and see how he likes it…Pick it up at http://www.amazon.com/A-Taste-Old-Revenge-ebook/dp/B006IHZVMQ/ref=sr_1_1_title_0_main?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1330720468&sr=1-1 Coming soon--reviews of some other fantastic books by Julia Madeleine, Allan Leverone and some other great writers.Blue skies,Les"},

Wayne downtown library and just got back. It was on ebooks and how librarians can help authors who publish ebooks. Great discussion and a great audience (all librarians). These people really like authors and want to do everything they can to help us.Also, I was asked by Sean Casserley, the Manager of their Bibliographic and Information Technology Services to return in the next few days and record a 40-minute interview on writing, which will be shown on local TV and UTube. Kinda pumped about that. I really connected with Sean--he's a native New Zealander and has a half-brother who's a Maori. It's quite an honor as the Ft. Wayne library is nationally-acclaimed--they have what's considered the third-biggest resource on genealogy in the world, ranking just behind the Library of Congress and the Mormon library. We gets hundreds of thousands of visitors a year from all over just for the genealogical resources. Anyway, I'll let you know when it comes up on UTube.And then , when I got home a few minutes ago, I was pleasantly surprised to see that B.R.

What we call \"ancient history.\" However, I still visit my \"alma mater\" occasionally (Pendleton) and when I do, I usually take a few cartons of books to donate to the prison library. It's pretty much the same as when I was there--fairly sparse and not much on the shelves. Therefore, I was delighted at two recent blogs that talked about the value of books for inmates and wanted to share what they had to say with y'all. The first is by Thomas Pluck, noir writer extraordinaire, who brought to my attention a wonderful organization that helps furnish prison libraries. You can read his post at: http://www.pluckyoutoo.com/2012/01/crime-writers-helping-crooks.htmlTom's post came out awhile back. And then, today the great Lee Lofland presented a marvelous post on his blog (The Graveyard Shift) an terrific article that really depicts honestly what books can do for inmates. Check it out at: http://www.leelofland.com/wordpress/15-amazing-effects-of-prison-libraries/ For those who maybe aren't familiar with Lee, he's THE expert on police procedures and forensics and runs a police academy for writers that's unparalleled anywhere. Check out his blog. Always great and informative stuff.And finally, I want to share a little love my friend and fellow crime writer, B.R. Stateham gave me on his blog where he reviewed THE BITCH. He made me feel guilty as I read one of his novels--A TASTE OF OLD REVENGE--awhile back and loved ir and told him I'd be posting a review of it... and haven't yet written it. I will, B.R.! I promise!

{"title": "Adverbs and adjectives", "date": "Friday, February 3, 2012", "text": "Hi folks,I've posted this before, but it's been awhile and in the past I've received good feedback from people who haven't seen it before. Hope it helps inform your own writing a bit!THE REJECTION OF ADVERBS AND ADJECTIVES AND OTHER EXAMPLES OF BAD OR MISGUIDED ADVICE TO WRITERSAs thinking creatures, most of us look for easier ways to complete tasks. That includes writing. Nothing wrong with that—it’s a mark of intelligence. Sometimes, though, that approach can get us in trouble. We seem to have a need for shortcuts and sometimes end up relying on bumper sticker kinds of slogans to guide us in our writing.Sayings like: Write what you know. That’s about the silliest advice ever given a writer. If we wrote “what we knew,” we’d be unable to write about murder… unless we’d murdered someone. We’d find it impossible to write stories set in the future or the distant past… unless we’d lived a thousand years or had a time machine. We couldn’t write from the opposite gender’s pov. Or, from the pov of an animal. We couldn’t write about anything we didn’t personally know about. The proper advice is: Write what you can convince the reader you know. Problem is, that doesn’t fit on a bumper sticker as easily…Another of those bumper sticker slogans thrust upon writers is: Show, don’t tell. Like most of these nifty sayings, there’s a germ of truth buried there. The fact is, there are plenty of times in fiction when telling works much better than showing and is the proper thing to do. You can’t show everything. If you did, you’d end up with a… screenplay. This is one reason novels are longer than screenplays. Three-four hundred pages versus ninety. A lot of those additional pages are devoted to… telling. Exposition/summary. It’s one of the advantages of a novel over a screenplay for a literary or reading experience.Witness:It was not that he was a cowed or naturally timorous person, far from it; but he had been for some time in an almost morbid state of irritability and tension. He had cut himself off from everybody and withdrawn so completely into himself that he now shrank from every kind of contact. He was crushingly poor, but he no longer felt the oppression of his poverty. For some time he had ceased to concern himself with everyday affairs. He was not really afraid of any landlady, whatever plots he might think she was hatching against him, but to have to stop on the stairs and listen to all her chatter about trivialities in which he refused to take any interest, all her complaints, threats, and insistent demands for payment, and then to have to extricate himself, lying and making excuses—no, better to creep downstairs as softly as a cat and slip out unnoticed.That kind of looks like “telling” or “exposition” to me. And it is. It’s also from a pretty good country writer—a guy named Dostoevsky and it’s from a book which has enjoyed healthy sales, a little tome titled Crime and Punishment. Bet that bumper sticker (Show, don’t tell) wasn’t on his writer’s buggy…Sayings like: Avoid adverbs and be sparing of adjectives. Which just happens to be the point of today’s discourse.Why on earth would a writer avoid using adverbs? They’re a legitimate part of speech and, if used properly can be among the strongest tools in the writer’s toolbox. Most will claim they’re the weakest, but I’ll show you some examples where no other part of speech works as well.The same deal holds with adjectives. Used properly—which means with originality—they can transform your prose.So where does this advice come from? That’s easy. It comes from the selected reading style of many writing teachers. By “selective reading” I mean lazy reading. A person who sees part of a piece of advice, but either ignores the rest of it or just doesn’t see it—it’s invisible to him or her. If it doesn’t come from lazy reading, it perhaps comes from a predilection for… lazy teaching. It’s just so much easier to tell our little charges to eschew adverbs and most adjectives, rather than actually reading the writer’s work and showing him or her which work well and which don’t and why. To do that would be… work. Or, perhaps this advice comes from the fruit of the same tree—the instructor simply parrots what was taught him or her and accepts everything his or her mentor passed on as gospel without challenging it. Again, a form of laziness.John Gardner said, “Adverbs are either the dullest tools or the sharpest tools in the novelist’s toolbox.” Mark Twain said, “When you catch an adjective, kill it.” William Zinsser said, “Most adjectives are… unnecessary. Like adverbs, they are sprinkled into sentences by writers who don’t stop to think that the concept is already in the noun.”Here’s how several generations of writers have read these guys’ advice.Don’t use adverbs and adjectives.Which… isn’t exactly what they said. They’re like the Paul Harvey’s of writing instruction. Well, they’re like half of a Paul Harvey. They kind of forget to include that famous “rest of the story.”You wonder if those who keep parroting this advice on adverbs and adjectives have read what these guys actually said. All of those folks quoted are good, if not, great writers and teachers. Makes sense that what they’re telling us is sound, right? Well, if we actually read what they said precisely. Nary a one of them said: Don’t use adverbs and adjectives. Just about every one of them had a disclaimer. Gardner: “…or the sharpest tools in the novelist’s toolbox.” Zinsser: “Most adjectives…” Notice he didn’t say all; he said most. That sort of means that some adjectives and adverbs work and work well. Zinsser also went on to say: “…they are sprinkled into sentences by writers who don’t stop to think…” And, that’s the source of the problem. Writing instructors who pass on these “rules” haven’t stopped to think themselves perhaps, so they’re incapable of recognizing students as being any different from themselves. Writers who… don’t stop to think.What each of these guys is maintaining is that adverbs and adjectives are fine to use… if used judiciously. With originality. That’s the… rest of the story. The important part that never seems to be delivered in classes and books.I took a lot of the information here from three sources. One, from the best writer’s textbook ever written, Janet Burroway’s Writing Fiction and from a 2006 article by Ben Yagoda in the NY Times, which you can accesss at: http://www.nytimes.com/2007/03/11/books/chapters/0311-1st-yago.html?_r=1&pagewanted=2 . Also, some of the material here can be found in my writing book, Finding Your Voice.Used thoughtfully (which some of these writing advisors don’t think you’re capable of, alas), adverbs and adjectives can sharpen and illuminate your prose magnificently, as in the following examples:\"In those trusses I saw a reminder of a country-fairgrounds grandstand, or perhaps the penumbrous bones of the Polo Grounds roof.\" -Roger Angell on the gridwork at the new baseball stadium in Baltimore \"She shook her head, and a smell of alembicated summer touched his nostrils.\" -Sylvia Townsend Warner \"The Sunday's events repeated themselves in his mind, bending like nacreous flakes around a central infrangible irritant.\" -John Updike \"He had the surface involvement-style-while I had the deep-structural, immobilizing synovial ballooning of a superior mind.\" -Nicholson Baker on Updike \"The great out-sticking ears that frame his face like cartilaginous quotation marks.\" -Michael Kelly on Ross Perot  “She had been to Germany, Italy, everywhere that one visits acquisitvely.” Elizabeth Bowen, The Last September“She jammed the pedal to the floor, and like something huge and pre-historic and pea-brained, the Jeep leapt stupidly out of its stall.” Sharon Sheehe Stark, A Wrestling Season“So closely had we become tied to the river that we could sense where it lay and make for it instinctively like cattle.” W.D. Wetherell, Chekhov’s Sister“When Sula first visited the Wright house, Helene’s curdled scorn turned to butter.” Toni Morrison, Sula“With a bladdery whack it (the boat) slapped apart and sprang away.” Sharon Sheehe Stark, A Wrestling Season“Hank was not accepted at Harvard Law School; but goodhearted Yale took him.” John Updike, “The Other”“On the far side of the room, under the moiling dogs the twins are playing.” Francois Camoin, “Baby, Baby, Baby”Are you gonna tell these people not to use adjectives or adverbs?My advice isn’t to eliminate adverbs and adjectives. Just take some time and use them in an original way. They’ll elevate your writing if you do. Just about everybody who is writing these days is culling out their adverbs and pruning their adjectives. If you can learn to use both in truly original ways, whose work do you think is going to stand out?You might wonder if I’ve ever given any of my writing students advice to not use adverbs and adjectives. Well, sure. Nobody’s perfect! I’ve also changed. Like they say: If you’re green, you’re growing—if you’re ripe, you’re rotten.” I hope I’m green enough to not keep telling folks the same things, ad nauseum. Especially if I discover the advice was wrong. In this case, I think it is.The next time somebody delivers a writing “absolute” to you—especially one that could easily fit into a bumper sticker--you might want to look at it with a clear and open mind. Don’t trust everything you hear. In fact, your own instincts are often much better than what others may tell you. Chances are, you’re a writer because you were a reader first, and it’s that reading experience that I suspect has given you the best body of advice you’ll ever get for your work. You’ve already internalized most of what you need to know from reading lots and lots of books. Use it. It’s trustworthy most of the time.Hope this helps!Blue skies,Les"},

{"title": "THE BITCH getting rave reviews!", "date": "Monday, January 30, 2012", "text": "Hi folks,I just saw two new reviews of THE BITCH on Amazon and I’m beaming from ear-to-ear! I have to share these! They’re both from bestselling writers and not easy to impress critics. I’m friends with Nigel Bird, but even so he won’t provide anything but his honest assessment of anyone’s work, whether he’s friends with them or not. The other one, is by a writer whose work I read and really enjoy, Allan Leverone, but don’t know personally. This one hit me right out of the blue. It’s just extremely gratifying when your peers and people you respect like what you’re doing. Means the world!The novel earlier received wonderful reviews from some of the best writers out there—folks like Paul D. Brazill, Anthony Neil Smith, Tom Pluck and Carl Brush, and these last two are the icing on the cake.Here they are:5.0 out of 5 stars Gritty and unforgettable, January 28, 2012 By Allan Leverone \"author\" (New Hampshire) - See all my reviews(REAL NAME)    Amazon Verified Purchase(What's this?) This review is from: The Bitch (Kindle Edition) Jake Bishop is a two-time loser, a B&E specialist who is down to his last shot at life. One more conviction and he'll be sent away for good as part of Michigan's three strikes and you're out habitual offender law, or The Bitch, as it's known to the cons.But Jake has no intention of ever seeing the inside of a prison cell again. He learned a trade - hairdressing - while on the inside and discovered he's got a talent for it. Using hard work and a little luck, Jake turns his newly discovered talent into steady employment and eventually the opportunity to open his own shop.Jake is determined to turn his life around, and he's doing it. His wife is pregnant with their first child, his shop will be opening in just a few weeks. Things couldn't be going better.Until he receives a call from his from his old prison cellmate, Walker Joy, that is. Walker is fresh out of the can, and Jake owes Walker big-time, thanks to an incident that occurred in prison. The ex-con is planning a big score. He needs Jake's help and has come to collect on the debt.One last job.And that's how it starts. Things go rapidly downhill from there for Jake Bishop, who is forced to walk a razor-thin line he hoped never to walk again, knowing that getting caught would mean the end of his family, his freedom, his life.I finished reading THE BITCH last night and haven't stopped thinking about it since. Les Edgerton has written a rare crime novel, making a sympathetic character out of a guy most people would cross the street to avoid if they saw coming the other direction.THE BITCH isn't for everyone. If you prefer your crime fiction sanitized, suitable for all viewers, you're probably going to want to stay away from this particular novel. It's violent and gritty and profane. It's also incredibly human and even, at times, tender, as we watch in open-mouthed horror a guy forced into a course of action that can only end one way - badly.I'm a pretty easy grader when I review books. I write novels, and I know how much blood, sweat and tears go into the process, so I don't often have a whole lot to say about any book that's openly negative. But a book like THE BITCH makes me question my reviewing process because it's so head-and-shoulders above most other fiction.I love noir fiction precisely because it's so real. I consider Tom Piccirilli the master of modern noir, and I'm here to say Les Edgerton has vaulted himself to a position right behind Piccirilli with THE BITCH. I give this book five stars, only because I can't give it six. Or seven.It's just that good. 5.0 out of 5 stars bitching, January 28, 2012 Bynigel p bird (Scotland, UK) - See all my reviewsAmazon Verified Purchase(What's this?) This review is from: The Bitch (Kindle Edition) In baseball it's 3 strikes and you're out, for ex-con, Jake, 3 strikes and he's in. For life. And ain't that The Bitch? Jake's been inside. Twice. One more conviction and he's going away for good. Fortunately for Jake, he's sick of prison life and has decided to go straight. He's been to college to better himself and has even built a reputation as a hair-stylist that's good enough for him to set up his own salon. I love this incongruity - big, bad Jake with his blood-stained hands chopping away at a perm. And he's met a woman too. Paris. Beautiful, sexy, smart and about to have Jake's baby. Looks like he's hit the jackpot, no? Thing is, Jake doesn't know his stories. Paris was the guy who did it for Troy. A name like that and maybe he should have sensed that his bed-of-roses might be full of thorns. `It all began with a phone call.' The first thorn appears in the form of Walker Joy, one-time cellmate and saviour. Walker's in big trouble. He owes big money to big crooks. One job will see him safe. All he needs is a break in man. Of course, Jake's not having any of it. He knows which side his bread is buttered. Problem is Walker has a few aces up his sleeve and Jake knows he's screwed. It's enough to drive an alcoholic to drink. Really. From there on in the story unfolds. Jake is reeled in like a prize-fish on the end of the line, all the while knowing that he's got a hook right up his behind. He's not a bad bloke, you see. Or at least his heart's in the right place. Circumstance has him by the short-and-curlies and no matter how he examines the angles, he's lined up for the corner pocket. At every point of the story where a ray of hope appears, the world conspires against him and as every chapter comes to a close, the need to read on grows stronger. It's a well-told tale. I found it hard not to feel for Jake. If it were a film or a play, it would be the kind that would have you shouting out for him to get the hell out of there. `He's behind yer!' and `He's still behind yer!' On the whole, the plot is very much in the present and is all the more uncomfortable for that. It's punctuated by prison stories and tales from Jake's past that should possibly have made me think less of the man; instead it had the opposite effect. Well paced, engaging and very entertaining, it's like one of the small diamonds in the collection Jake is aiming to steal. The ending is perfectly weighted. Sits on top of the story like the bowler hat on a dapper gent, a hat that needs to be doffed every time Les Edgerton approaches. Well done, sir.

Our of 14 Amazon reviews, 11 gave it a 5-star rating, two a 4-star rating, and one a 3-star.Amazon Reviews5.0 out of 5 stars Beware: ADDICTIVE READING AHEAD, January 11, 2012 By M.L. Rigdon - See all my reviewsOK, so I started this book and couldn't stop. Edgerton's ability to haul the reader into the story and minds of his characters, in this case, the criminal mentality, left me helpless to set the book down and fiercely invested in this work of fiction that feels like fact. The odd thing was that I didn't have much sympathy with the character but felt mesmerized by the train wreck about to happen. With no experience of incarceration, I can't comment on that, but do know about surviving stressful, traumatic environments on a daily basis. There comes a point where emotions must be kept at a distance in order to function. Edgerton shows what it's like to be forced into institutionalized stress 24/7, the eventual moral nonchalance, and resultant urge/addiction to do something or anything to feel again. An exciting, scary read and window into recidivism. 5.0 out of 5 stars Masterful Prison Novel Is in Top Form as Chester Himes' Writing, December 10, 2011 By Ed Lynskey, \"author of ASK THE DICE and THE Z... (Washington, D.C.) - See all my reviewsLes Edgerton's masterful JUST LIKE THAT is the same rich vein as the noir-miester Chester Himes' prison novel YESTERDAY WILL MAKE YOU CRY. Both authors drew upon their life experience as convicts to craft their visceral, powerful, and, most of all, honest narratives. The protagonist Jake Mayes' portrayal is based eighty percent on actual events. He's a complex man, hardboiled but racked with searing pain, especially over his femme fatale/lover Donna. I liked reading his colorful trip taken to New Orleans with his friend Bud where a strong bond is forged between the men. Hollywood and TV have gotten it all wrong about the modern U.S. prison culture. Read JUST LIKE THAT to get the real skinny. Mr. Edgerton doesn't pull any punches at debunking Tinsel Town's myths. The gritty details emerging in the inmates' daily existence behind bars will surprise you, page after page. This essential writing makes for a captivating crime fiction read. 4.0 out of 5 stars Just Like That, October 8, 2011 By shirleylou - See all my reviewsIf Thelma and Louise had stayed at the bar they might have met up with the characters in Just Like That. I never dreamed I'd be rooting for protaganists who, in real life, I would studiouly avoid. Les opens up the seedier side of life with grit and humor. Help other customers find the most helpful reviews 5.0 out of 5 stars Les near his best, September 29, 2011 By JJ Toner \"JJ Toner\" (Co Wicklow, IE) - See all my reviewsI loved this book. The narrative bounces along with its own in-built energy, like the engine in a 1964 Mustang that refuses to stop even after you've switched it off and trousered the key. Les throws a lot of the writing book out the window in this one, followed by large parts of the grammar primer, and yet, the voice comes across as curiously erudite. The word \"if\" is noticeably absent all over the place, as in \"You're smart, you try and become invisible.\" For anyone that needs to know what prison in the USA is really like, this book is Prison USA 101. A minor gripe I had with the book was a couple of passages where he repeated himself. The one serious gripe I had was the way the narrative was set aside every now and then to educate the reader on Tinseltown prison movie BS. I would have preferred to draw my own conclusions on that score.Still a five star book with a strong, throbbing storyline and an angry voice telling it. I learned a lot about the criminal mind. Robbers rob for the adrenaline rush much more than the financial rewards - who knew? I also learned a few new words along the way. As you'd expect from a master of the arts of noir writing, there were some wonderful turns of phrase, like \"...his face as white as an Eskimo's ass\" and \"...you were going to go back and sit in your f***ing cell and give names to your toes\"As I drew near the end of the book I was gutted, but consoled by the fact that I have another of his books waiting on my kindle. 3.0 out of 5 stars More a prison story than a road-trip tale, September 25, 2011 By Cliff Hardy (Sydney NSW Australia) - See all my reviewsThis book was promoted as a story about two ex-cons going on a road trip, well that's true in part. Most of the story deals with the prison time of the lead character, Jake Mayes, both before and after the road trip. The book is semi-autobiographical with author Les Edgerton also spending a fair chunk of his life behind bars. This gives Just Like That an incredibly authentic feel and through Jake Mayes you get a terrific insight into the workings of the criminal mind. Bad habits, bad girls and bad choices all are portrayed with a sense that trouble is not too far away and the randomness of the violence is astounding. The story is well written and moves along at a nice clip. While Jake Mayes is certainly someone you wouldn't want to get on the wrong side of you also get a good feel for the reason he is like he is, and why he is where he is. 5.0 out of 5 stars BLAM!, September 15, 2011 By Paul D Brazill (Bydgoszcz, Poland) - See all my reviewsJUST LIKE THAT has it all. Great dialogue, whipcrack scenes and meaty characters haul you along on a harboiled crime road-trip worthy of the Elmore Leonard and Joe R Lansdale. A shot to the heart as well as the head, JUST LIKE THAT is highly recommended. 4.0 out of 5 stars Uneasy time, August 22, 2011 By Mr. Gareth Price \"gazza_hoho\" (Stockport) - See all my reviews(REAL NAME)    Les Edgerton takes incidents from his own early life and commits them to (electronic) paper with an honesty and integrity that you come across all too rarely. Just Like That starts as a buddy book & ends as a jailhouse book, the two sides weighted almost equally. It barely let's up with the action as Jake, Les' alter-ego, goes from one bad choice to another and ends up back in Pendleton jail for the failed robbery of a bar. A nasty, to put it mildly, encounter with another inmate colours the rest of the book from here as the daily grind and desperation of jail life unfolds and ends in murder. What stood out for me was the writing style - it's written in a conversational first person tone that really draws you in and keeps you reading even though some of the events descibed are really grim. Must be the years behind the barbers chair that have honed that kind of storytelling style. Obvious comparisons here to the work of Eddie Bunker as they both cover similar terrain but Mr Edgerton throws in a welcome sense of black humour without smoothing the edges too much. Will be checking out the rest of Mr Edgertons output (he has at least 3 more novels & a short story collection out soon)as this one hit the spot. Enjoy 5.0 stars out of 5 starsBy Sharon Z McMeel - See all my reviewsThis book riveted me to my seat. Mr. Edgerton is a writer who really captures not only the details of the inner workings of a criminal mind; but the whole world of prisons and a crime spree road trip across parts of urban and rural America. My husband is really the crime fiction buff in the family, and I'm more of the Keruoac \"On the Road\" fan. But Mr. Edgerton's writing really had a powerful prose style that makes the reading experience a \"literary\" one...albeit with more violence and bloodshed than \"On the Road.\" But I must admit I could not stop turning the pages of JUST LIKE THAT. I'm glad this was recommeded to me and I plan on reading more of this author's original and exciting work. 5.0 stars out of 5 starsBy ChloeMac13 - See all my reviewsI read Just Like That a week ago, but still don't feel I can adequately articulate how the novel moved me. As a female who mostly reads women authors with female leads, I felt a tad strange about my immediate fascination for Jake. This con was unlike anyone I knew personally or read about in other novels, and the idea of rash criminal behavior without provocation sent a chill through me. Still, night after night I broke promises to myself to read only three or four chapters. With a story that seemed surreal in its unfamiliar setting, lingo baffling as hell, yet as much fun as learning a foreign language, and testosterone practically seeping through my Kindle, I couldn't believe how easily I'd been hooked. Les did what all writers hope to do; kept this reader thinking about events and characters from the book for days. God knows I never want to find myself inside a place so dreary and dangerous, however I'm suddenly Jonesin' to read about modern day life inside a female prison. 5.0 out of 5 stars Edgerton slams another one home with Just Like That., August 16, 2011 By Karen L. Wells \"Karen L. Wells\" (Boca Raton, FL United States) - See all my reviews(REAL NAME)    Take a walk--no--take a run on the wild side with Les Edgerton and buckle up before you start reading his high-octane novel, Just Like That. Be sure to allow enough time to finish it in one sitting--it's a can not put down novel based mostly on Edgerton's own life experiences (85%) --it is gusty, gritty and authentic. One wonders while reading what 85% of the novel is real and true? Just Like That gives the reader a lot to think about days after finishing the book. Tell a friend. 5.0 out of 5 starsBy Tom R/Scottsdale, AZ - See all my reviewsWow, I just love the way Les writes! The title \"Just Like That\" is brilliant and will resonate with you on every page and upon completion of the book. The story is very raw with absolute clarity told through the criminal mind. I now look and see some folks in a completely different way. The book title \"Just Like That\" just became my new favorite colloquialism. 5.0 out of 5 starsBy Susanne Schuster - See all my reviews(REAL NAME)    We start with a picaresque tale of a couple of ex-cons hitting the road and end with the un-picaresque tale of buddies back in the pen. For visceral excitement, JUST LIKE THAT is nothing short of Elmore Leonard. For True Crime Fiction--well there's nothing to compare it to. You'll not only get involved on an elemental level with the real-life con characters and their real-life criminal action, but you'll learn why everything you've seen on the small or the big screen about criminals, courts, and penitentiaries is as about as genuine as a politician's smile. An exciting read and a handbook to the inside conveyed in first-rate writing. Spell that w-i-n-n-e-r. 5.0 out of 5 stars A must read and watch out - Les is going for it on this one., August 14, 2011 By Sarah Faurote - See all my reviewsThe great thing about Just Like That is the language. The feel. Les Edgerton is a master of words. Like Albert Camus, he describes a killing in short, simple language that carries a blow to the mind. This is a creation of visual travel. Read Just Like That and you may wonder if you wake up to the sound of bars locking shut. Read on. Go Go Go! 5.0 out of 5 stars A writer at the top of his game, August 9, 2011 By Eddie Vega (Brooklyn, NY) - See all my reviewsEx-felon Les Edgerton knows the internal workings of the criminal mind, and with lean muscular prose he has written a book about it. While there are many qualities that make this book worth reading -- certainly the writing itself, which is excellent throughout, and the plot which moves with the kick of a 45 cal. bullet, -- what I most appreciated was its effort in coming to terms with the most perplexing of evils, those spur of the moment just-like-that crimes not motivated by necessity or reason but by some primal source that gives the lie to the perfectibility of mankind. Hope lots of you take advantage of the two-day freebie! If you like it, I’d really appreciate your posting a short review on Amazon and if you hit the “Like” button, I’m told that helps also. Also, if you enjoy the read, please check out my other titles, including THE PERFECT CRIME and THE BITCH. Coming soon is my collection of short stories, GUMBO YA-YA, from Snubnose Press.Blue skies,LesP.S. Check out Helen Ginger’s interview on Inspiration Forum.

{"title": "GUMBO YA-YA", "date": "Thursday, January 12, 2012", "text": "Hi folks,I'm still glowing from the Best Thriller Award from the Preditors and Editors poll! Again, thank you, each and every one who voted and got your pals to vote--what you did for me was the real award.And... it doesn't stop. I was just informed by Brian Lindenmuth, my editor at Snubnose Press, that my short story collection, GUMBO YA-YA, will be released within the next couple of weeks. He told me I could show y'all the cover... which I LOVE!Here it tis...I love it!Watch for it--I'll be announcing it the instant it becomes available.The title came about in the same manner as did the title for my first collection MONDAY'S MEAL. There are a couple of requirements traditionally for short story collections. One, at least half should have been previously published in prestigious literary magazines. This collection satisfies that requirement as all but a couple were published in such venues as High Plains Literary Review, Houghton-Mifflin's Best American Mystery Stories, Murdaland Magazine, The Analecta, Blue Moon Literary and Art Review Magazine, Imaginary Friends Anthology, Flatmancrooked, Aethlon, Noir Nation International Crime Magazine, On The Record anthology, and an essay in it was published in Circle K Magazine. A couple of the stories were nominated for the Pushcart Award and Edgar Allan Poe (short story category) Awards. So, that requirement was satisfied. Although, increasingly, collections aren't requiring prior publication as much these days.Two,  short story collections are traditionally supposed to be centered around a theme. Which was a problem with MONDAY'S MEAL and I faced the same problem with this one. There just isn't a theme in either collection. And publishers decided a long time ago that readers wanted to know what the stories were about. They didn’t feel readers would buy otherwise. If the reader was into crime or noir, they wanted the stories in a collection to be about… crime or noir. If they wanted to read tales about romance, they wanted to know that’s what they were buying. If they wanted horror… well, you get the picture. The problem was in MONDAY’S MEAL was that the stories included in it were kind of all over the map. No “theme” involved. Just stories. So I came up with what I felt was the perfect solution. I titled it MONDAY’S MEAL.In the South, where I grew up, Monday was traditionally washday. In my youth (back when dinosaurs first went on the endangered list) Monday was the day when the wife took care of her brood of children, did the week’s wash, cleaned the house, did a host of other chores, and still prepared a hearty meal for supper. Because of time constraints, that was the day most women prepared a stew or, where I lived, on the Texas Gulf Coast, a gumbo. It was the perfect meal for Mondays, because the woman could run in whenever she had a spare moment or two, throw in an ingredient, and go back out and hang out another load on the clothesline and yell at the kids for fighting amongst themselves. What happened was a lot of ingredients went into it—ingredients that, upon first glance, looked unrelated and even questionable as to how they’d work together—but in the end, when she ladled it out to her husband and kids, turned out to be a delicious combination.And that was how and why that collection came up with its name.I faced the same problem with this collection. Stories without a theme. This time, the answer came to me much quicker. I grew up in a bar and seafood restaurant in Freeport, Texas. My grandmother, who owned the business, had a wood stove she reserved for one dish only. Gumbo. Only Yankees cook gumbo on electric or gas stoves. True Southerners use wood stoves. And Grandma Louise Vincent was, if anything, a “true Southerner.” In fact, she wouldn’t serve a Yankee in her establishment. Kick ‘em right out. Some who were booted threatened to go to the law as their civil rights were being violated and she told them to go right ahead. It wasn’t a problem for her as the county sheriff was a daily customer… And didn't care much for Yankees either...She had a real problem when her daughter—my mother—married a Yankee, but that’s another story…Anyway, nowadays if you go into a restaurant that serves gumbo, it’ll reflect a theme, same as short story collections. “Shrimp” gumbo. “Okra” gumbo. “Crab” gumbo. “Crawfish” gumbo. (Or, as we called it, “Mudbug Gumbo.”) Whatever. In our restaurant, Grandma Vincent made the same kind of gumbo most oldtimers made. A concoction we called “Gumbo Ya-Ya.” It had different ingredients in it, depending on the season and depending on the availability of ingredients. Ingredients, that when considered separately, didn’t always appear to be compatible. But… they were. Once cooked together, the meal ended up absolutely delicious.My own favorite ingredient—in season—was crab eggs. I absolutely love the orange, gummy texture and flavor of crab eggs. Probably an ingredient that Yankees would turn their delicate noses up at…Anyway, that’s how this collection of stories got its name. Thought you might be interested in the genesis of the title.And, I really hope you like the stories in it! There’s a bit of a bonus. Besides the stories, there is an essay I’m very proud of, titled “Censorship and Why I Love Charles Bukowski.” This essay has a history. I wrote it as my graduating address for my MFA degree at Vermont College and delivered it to the single largest crowd at graduation in their history, according to Pam Painter, well-known author and one of my advisors, who’d been on the faculty since the program began. It was later published in Circle K Magazine. In it, I rail against what was a new phenomenon at the time—a concept called “political correctness.” At the time, I saw it as one of the biggest threats against freedom of speech ever propagated. Today, more than 15 years later I see it as… the same thing.There’s also a bit from a memoir I’m still writing on that I think folks will enjoy. It’s centered around my son Mike and me when he was a little guy and I was coaching his youth baseball league team.Anyway, I’m pumped up that Snubnose Press has seen fit to publish this work. Just a few years ago, it had become increasingly difficult to get a collection published. Most publishers wouldn’t touch ‘em for a simple reason. Sales usually didn’t justify the publishing expense. Thanks to ebooks, that’s changing. And, that’s a good thing, in my mind.I hope you’ll agree.Blue skies,LesP.S. Here's a hint for Yankees attempting to cook their first gumbo. Well, two hints. First... you make a roue. Many otherwise good cooks can't make a roue. My mother can't and she's a born and bred Southerner. I'm proud to say that I make a great roue! Second, and most importantly--never put your spices in until just before it's done cooking. Otherwise, all the flavor \"cooks up\" and you'll be left with a tasteless, bland meal. Just sayin'...And, if you can glom onto crab eggs, throw 'em in..."},
{"title": "WE WON!", "date": "Wednesday, January 11, 2012", "text": "Hi folks,This is one of the happiest posts I’ve ever had the pleasure of writing! It looks like… drum roll, please…WE’VE WON THE PREDITORS and EDITORS POLL FOR BEST THRILLER OF 2011!!! THE WINNER IS…. THE BITCH!!!You can see the results here: http://critters.org/predpoll/tally_novelthrill.htWho do I start thanking? To be honest, the list is too long and this site will crash if I were even able to name everybody who voted or worked on my behalf to secure votes. There were people literally working to get more votes and keep my novel in first place right up until the very end at midnight last night!But, even though there’s no way I can possibly name each individual, I do want to give a particular shoutout to one group of people. My online novel writing class. Two nights ago when, after being in first place for nine days, it slipped to second, I notified one group that night before I went to bed--my class—the Boot Camp for Writers group. When I woke the next morning and went in to check where it was at… we were back in first place!You guys rock and I love you!As I do everybody else who took the time and the trouble to not only vote for THE BITCH, but asked friends and relatives to do so as well. I cannot begin to tell you how much your efforts on my behalf have meant to me. I will say this—even if I had lost, I would have felt like the biggest winner in the world for what you did for me.In fact, before I checked the standings this morning, I thought about all the people who had given up their time and went to the trouble they did and I realized then that, win or lose, I had won. Finding out THE BITCH had ended up the winner in the poll was just icing on the cake. I’m ecstatic it won, but I’m much more happy at what y’all did for me. I haven’t the words to say that can adequately express my appreciation so I’ll just say… THANK YOU.There were literally dozens of other writers who helped me out with their tweets and mentions on Facebook and on their blogs—I owe you folks! For people who think about and write about noir and murder and crime all day, there’s an awful lot of love among this group. I’m glad we’re all in the same foxhole with each other and have each others' backs.One guy in particular I need to single out. Anthony Neil Smith. Neil and I both had novels in this horserace and he threw his support to me. What kind of tough, brilliant writer does that? The kind that not only writes with grace, but practices it in his daily life.THE BITCH is also gathering all kinds of rave reviews which is so gratifying. I feel this is the best book I’ve ever written, but as we all know as writers, the success of a writer’s effort is never really known until the readers have been heard from. And, the reviews and comments have been simply fantastic. Thank you, each and every one! I’m so glad you liked it. This is the real payment for the effort we as writers expend.You can go here http://www.amazon.com/The-Bitch-ebook/dp/B006P2NLHG/ref=sr_1_1_title_0_main?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1324588756&sr=1-1 to see those reviews.I also owe a couple of people an enormous debt. My publishers at Bare Knuckle Press, Cort McMeel and Eddie Vega. If it weren’t for them and their belief in this novel, none of this would have been possible. Thanks, guys!I’m going to go collapse in a hot tub and savor this. At my age, champagne and riotous nights are a thing of the past, but I guarantee you I’m going to enjoy that tub!I love you folks.Blue skies,LesPreview"},
{"title": "FAMED CHEF GORDON RAMSEY HOLDS THE BEST WRITING CLASSES EVER!", "date": "Tuesday, January 10, 2012", "text": "Hi folks,Did I surprise you with the title of today’s post? I imagine so! After all, I suspect most who read this and are writers weren’t aware that Scotland’s Chef Gordon Ramsey taught writing. Most probably believe he’s involved in great cooking, right?Well, he does, but the lessons and more importantly—the philosophy—he teaches on his shows are spot on for writers who want to be the best they can be.Every single morning I have his shows on the BBC channel on. I’d rather watch them than read most writer’s how-to books or go to writer’s conventions and workshops. I learn everything I need to know about writing from this man.Watch him as he turns around a failing or struggling restaurant. Begin with a mindset—that everything he imparts about cooking be considered as him talking about writing.The principles he espouses for being a great chef or restaurateur are exactly the same principles required for a writer to not only be published but to be respected as a good or even great writer.He never bullshits. He never sugarcoats his take on the chef’s performance and output. Never. He doesn’t tolerate laziness. He doesn’t tolerate stupidity when the person he’s critiquing clearly isn’t stupid but is just performing stupidly. Which is only… laziness.He doesn’t tolerate alibis. He doesn’t tolerate assigning blame to others. He insists the person man up and face his own faults and correct them. He has no patience for those who feel they’re “entitled” to success. He insists that the only way to gain success is to earn it by their performance.He doesn’t tolerate those who believe their failures are caused by others, or by fate or bad luck.He knows that if you think you’re doing someone a kindness by not being honest with their effort, you’re delivering the greatest unkindness of all.He doesn’t mollycoddle anyone—ever.Look at how he approaches each person he tries to help. First, he’s brutally honest with them. If their product is shit, he lets them know it’s shit.He doesn’t tell them to be something they’re not or that they’re incapable of being. He doesn’t tell a chef who’s great at cooking steaks to begin cooking French cuisine. He simply tells them to begin cooking steaks well. To build on what they already have mastered and have ignored.Look at those who blame their patrons for not being successful. He doesn’t have much use for those folks. Kind of like the writer blaming the agents and editors for their lack of success. He has the same kind of patience (none) for that attitude that I do with my own students. It’s bullshit. If the writer is putting out quality work, do they really believe that agents and editors are not rushing to represent them because they have something personal against the writer? That’s so ludicrous it’s beyond funny. Any and all agents and editors want to find quality work. It’s what pays their bills, allows them to live in nice places, eat in great restaurants. If the work is shit, or even “average” who can work with that? The answer is obvious: nobody. Nobody can work with crap, any more than a chef can work with inferior ingredients or shoddy cooking techniques.I see writers all the time ranting against the “injustice” of the publishing industry and system. It’s always somebody else’s fault that Superstar Agent isn’t interested in their work. It’s always the Big Shot Editor’s fault that their work is rejected. It’s never their fault. It’s never that the product is crap. Those writers’ egos can’t seem to accept that what they put out is lousy. They’re just convinced that the only thing keeping them from being published is that their “genius” isn’t being recognized. Okay…But, just like Ramsey’s clients, that’s almost always the cause of writers’ failure. The ones who won’t admit that to themselves or look for excuses for their lack of success in others, will never make it. That’s just the truth. Sadly, far too many have self-deluded themselves into looking anywhere but the right place for the answers to their failure. The right place to look is in the mirror. If a writer can’t do that, he or she will never be successful. If that writer who rants about the “unfairness” of it all spent half the time they do on railing about life’s inequities on working to become a better writer… they would.The way Gordon Ramsey approaches his clients is exactly the way I approach my students and clients. With the truth. If the work is shit, they need to know it’s shit. You can’t change manure into roses if you don’t know it’s crap. Once you realize your work isn’t good, that’s the beginning of wisdom. That’s when the work has a chance of getting better. Of becoming publishable.My classes aren't labeled \"Lots of Praise and Handholding for Wannabe Writers.\" They called \"Les Edgerton's Boot Camp for Writers.\" There's a reason for that. We're interested in turning out publishable writers, not much interested in stroking egos. Take a look at Ramsey’s show. Substitute the word writer for chef. Look at what he’s telling each failing chef. Imagine he’s telling you the same things as a writer. They all apply.Here’s an apt example. I have a writer who’s been taking my classes for a year and a half. In her first class, she didn’t get beyond the first five pages of her beginning… FOR NINE WEEKS. Nine weeks. To come up with a proper novel beginning, one that began where it should, with the inciting incident. Others have taken many weeks to do so (my students call it “inciting incident hell.”). They’re right. It is hell. But, this student didn’t give up. She never blamed others. She just kept working… and working… and working. And, after nine weeks, she was given the okay to move past her first five pages. Today, a year and a half later, just this week I recommended her to an agent and a publisher. I’m pretty sure both will take her novel on. Even if they don’t, someone else will. She’s written a brilliant novel. Has it been hard? Absolutely! Anything worth doing requires work and hard work.Could she have written a novel in a year and a half without going through “inciting incident hell” first? Sure. Would it have been publishable? I doubt it. I’m pretty sure she’d agree with that. It's the lessons she learned in achieving a great beginning that she understands allowed her to write every page after that well.Finishing a novel is sometimes overrated. A chef can finish cooking a steak, but does that mean it’s a great steak and will bring the diner back? The only thing that matters is that the work be excellent. Nobody pays for “half good.” No matter how cheaply you price it.Has it been worth it to her? You’ll have to ask her, but I’m pretty sure she’d answer in the affirmative and loudly so. And, I suspect she, like many others who’ve taken my classes and survived, would voice the same kinds of sentiments that Chef Ramsey’s clients who succeed do.The point is, watch Chef Ramsey’s show as he works to transform attitudes. What he says is spot on what any decent teacher will tell you about your writing. Try to listen instead of waiting until they’re done talking to tell them why publishing is unfair to their genius…Sorry if this offends some. Actually, I’m not sorry. Any writing—even a blog—that everyone likes and agrees with is… crapola writing. All writing should affect the reader’s emotions—positive or negative. Doesn’t much matter. If this post offends some people and it angers them enough to go out and prove me wrong, then it’s valuable. If it re-energizes some writers into redoubling their efforts at quality writing, it’s valuable. If it causes some writers to look into the mirror and admit their lack of success is due only to the person staring back at them and they make the decision to change what they’re doing, it’s valuable.How can you tell if you have enough talent to succeed as a writer? That's easy. The same way Chef Ramsey can tell if the chef he's working with can rise from his failures. If he can cook a single dish that's excellent, he has the chops to be a good or great chef. Same thing with writers. If you can write a single paragraph or single sentence that's excellent, you have the chops to be a good or great writer. What's needed is the same for Chef Ramsey's students--all of the entrees need to be equally good. If you can write a great sentence, you have the ability you need to succeed. The thing is, you have to do the hard work to bring all of your sentences up to the same quality. That's called... hard work. Personally, I want every single person writing to succeed. I just know some won’t. I also know why they won’t. The sad thing is, they don’t.Watch Chef Ramsey and take in the lessons. You’ll be glad you did.Blue skies,LesP.S. For those who aren't pissed at what I said, and you're reading this on the 10th, I can still use your vote as per the posting just before this one. Thank you.   Hi folks,For nine days, my new novel, THE BITCH has been #1 in the Preditors and Editors Thriller Category Awards. With the last day of voting today, every day I watched the standings nervously, especially as other novels moved up. There’s no way of knowing if I had a big lead or a tiny one, but it was still there.Until last night. Last night, I took my wife Mary out for her birthday dinner, along with our son Mike and his girlfriend Chelsea. When we got home, I did as always and checked the list.THE BITCH had slipped to second place…I went to bed as low as I’ve been in a long time. So close…But, my students at the online class I teach got together and began asking their friends and family to vote (it’s one vote per email address so you can’t stuff the ballot box, which is a good thing). I know it was because of their effort as they were the only ones I notified before I went to bed. I’d planned today to post this on the blog and FB and see if we could make a comeback.My class people are the folks I want to be in the foxhole with!I know many of you have been there with me as well. I can’t begin to tell you how much your loyalty means to me!Well, this ayem I got up and checked the standings… and we’re back in first place! I know it’s tenuous and may not hold—the person in second is undoubtedly rallying his troops and doing everything he can to pass me again. So I’m making one more plea for your help.If you haven’t voted yet or if you have friends or relatives you don’t mind asking for their vote, here’s what you do.Go to the P&E polling site at http://critters.org/predpoll/novelthrill.shtmlScroll down until you see The Bitch by Les Edgerton and click on the box at it. Scroll down further and enter your name and email address. Scroll down more and enter the two security words and then submit your vote. You’ll get an email then from them and in it is a link you just click on and it takes you back to their site and informs you your vote has counted.That’s it.Voting ends today—not sure what time it ends—so if you can take a few minutes to help me out it would be hugely… and I mean HUGELY appreciated!Now. I’m going to go to a dark room, pull a blanket over my head and not come out until midnight. The suspense is killing me!Thank you, each and every one of you who did me this immense favor. I owe ya!Blue skies,Les"},

{"title": "SPOTS OPEN IN MY ONLINE WRITING CLASS", "date": "Thursday, January 5, 2012", "text": "Hi folks,My next online novel-writing class is scheduled to begin on Sunday, January 22, and we have two spots left if anyone's interested. It's conducted in a workshop structure where classmates send ten pages of their novel in each week and each member of the class comments on each other's work and I do also. The energy in class is contagious and each writer is extremely dedicated. Kind of intense--in fact, it's labeled \"Les Edgerton's Boot Camp Class\" and it is. This isn't a class for anyone who just wants praise--actually, all praise has to be earned. It's a class for people who have thick skins and only want to end up with a publishable novel and not have their egos stroked. Those who decide to join us will soon experience an incredible synergy not often obtained in such classes.Several who will be taking the coming class have been with me for several classes--although there are a few who entered the class for the first time last session and we have some newcomers this time. The folks there are very supportive of new classmates and it's a genuinely giving atmosphere.The class takes 16 weeks and usually we'll \"hit the wall\" a bit sometime during the term and take a week off. The fee is #350 (nonrefundable) and it can be paid prior to class, or it can also be paid in three installments of #125 each for a total of #375 for those paying in installments.Several in the class have told me they'll be posting information about their experiences in the comments section here. If interested, please let me know asap. We only have two slots remaining and experience shows they'll fill fast. Please email me at butchedgerton@comcast.net.If anyone is interested in auditing the class, the fee for auditing is #100. Auditors will have complete access to everything we do in class but won't have their work critiqued or contribute to the discussion. We can allow as many auditors as are interested. Several of the writers in the last class are very close to finishing their novels and each one is very publishable. In fact, one writer is within just a few days of having her novel read by my agent and others and a publisher. She's applying the final polish to it and out the door it goes! Several others will finish theirs during the next class and will be sending it out. Hope to see you in class!Blue skies,LesP.S. On another note, my novel THE BITCH is still in first place in the Preditors and Editors thriller category, but voting is still going on and will be until the 10th. A couple of folks are moving up fast, so if you haven't voted, I'd really appreciate it. Just go to http://critters.org/predpoll/novelthrill.shtml and click on my novel. And... THANKS!"},

{"title": "THE BITCH is coming! Promise...", "date": "Wednesday, December 21, 2011", "text": "Hi folks,I know at least some of you are awaiting publication of my psychological thriller, THE BITCH, and I just wanted to give you an update on it.The holdup is due entirely to the publisher, Eddie Vega. Lest you think I just threw Eddie under the bus, allow me to explain.The whole problem is, Eddie's a perfectionist. Definitely a guy who's out of touch with modern life! Who in contemporary publishing does what this guy does! And, what is it he does, exactly?Well, if you’ve read many ebooks, you’ve no doubt encountered a number of glitches in at least some of them. Paragraphs separated by space breaks, ala Lorrie Moore… but not on purpose as her work is. Those little wing-dings that mysteriously appear, such as the little blank boxes that sometimes show up. Paragraphs that aren’t indented. Spelling errors, punctuation mistakes, lines split mysteriously in places that don’t make sense. Dozens of other glitches.Those who’ve published ebooks are well aware of them. The best publishers try to eliminate as many as possible. They appear because of the conversion programs available. What goes into the wood-chipper of a conversion program isn’t necessarily what comes out. While the best publishers do their best to clean up and eliminate conversion errors, there are some who could care less. Just slap it up on Amazon and fuggetaboutit. Some of these publishers just don’t give a damn. Slap it through the program and get it out there…Not Eddie, nor Cort McMeel, the publishers of Bare Knuckles Press and Noir Nation International Crime Magazine. These guys are just plain anal. They have this ridiculous notion that what the buyer sees on his/her Kindle or Nook or other e-reader should be nothing less than perfect and that nothing on the page detract from the reading experience.Here’s an encapsulated history of the editing of this book. First, I went through at least three major edits and rewrites of the entire manuscript under the guidance and tutelage of Cort and Eddie. Several dozen additional minor rewrites. This was before it was sent out for the ebook conversion process.Eddie worked with the artists and technical wizards of the brilliant firm of Hurricanes and Butterflies in Prague, both for the cover and for the conversion to ebook format. He spent literally weeks just on the cover. Not to mention spending a boatload of money on it! This wasn’t some cover art from Jim Bob at the local graphic shop. He wanted the perfect cover. And got it, at least in my opinion. Oh—and that’s another thing. While most publishers I’ve worked with have been very gracious in soliciting my opinion about the cover on my books, not all do so. These guys really care that the author likes his cover.For the past month, Eddie has had the three of us—him, Cort and me--going over and over the converted manuscript. Three times we’ve gone over and over a new version. Each time, we found and ferreted out conversion errors and my own errors.Eddie and Cort have literally been working on manuscripts for BKP for 20-hour days, seven days a week. For months and months. They only publish books they’re passionate about and they’ve treated my manuscript with more respect and loving care than I’ve ever experienced with any other publisher, including several of the Big Six legacy publishers.I’ve had to turn my phone off at night to get any sleep. Eddie is a vampire and if I didn’t turn off my phone, I’d be sure to get a call from him at three in the ayem. He often works through the night and I think he thinks the rest of us are doing the same.The thing is, both Eddie and Cort feel this is a great book. And, they treat it with that kind of respect. Whether it is or not, I imagine readers will let us know. I’m very happy with it—especially after these guys helped me make it much “gooder” than it was when I submitted it to them.I wish all my writer friends will get to experience a publishing experience akin to mine with Bare Knuckles Press with their own publishers! It’s the kind of experience that renews my faith in publishers—the kind that used to exist in larger numbers. Who aren’t concerned about the money first and foremost, but more in delivering what they feel to be worthwhile literature to the world.So, I’m not throwing Eddie under the bus at all. Mostly, I love the respect and care he’s given my work, even if it gets the release date moved up some.At this moment, we’re hoping it’ll be available in a day or so. In the meantime, I just wanted those of you who’ve been asking me when they can get a copy to know what’s going on. It’s all good.I also wanted to share with you what some folks have said about THE BITCH in the blurbs they’ve generously given to me. As you can see by their names, these are people most of us know from their own, superb work. It means a lot to me what they had to say.BLURBSTHE BITCH is the kind of raw crime fiction that’s right up my alley, like sandpaper for the brain. Edgerton has got the chops. Mad chops. Gonna make us all ashamed of our puny efforts one day. —Anthony Neil Smith, bestselling author of All the Young Warriors, Choke on Your Lies, Psychomatic, Hogdoggin’, Yellow Medicine, The Drummer, To the Devil, My Regards, Devil Red (Hap and Leonard) and others. The Bitch is a vicious barnstormer of a novel, a noir rollercoaster that won’t let you unbuckle until that final three-word smackdown. Les Edgerton is Eddie Bunker’s pulpy cousin and Eugene Izzi’s soul brother, and with a spiritual family like that, you can’t go wrong. Pick it up immediately.—Ray Banks, internationally bestselling author of Dead Money, Beast of Burden, The Big Blind. Saturday’s Child, Donkey Punch, No More Heroes and others.Les Edgerton doesn’t pussyfoot around. He writes about real people drowning in desperation in THE BITCH. He’s got a story to tell you so get ready; it’s coming at you fast. Get ready… —Linwood Barclay, international bestselling author of Never Look Away, Clouded Vision, The Last Resort, Fear the Worst, Too Close to Home, No Time for Goodbye, The Accident and others.Les Edgerton’s brilliantly hardboiled THE BITCH is the tense and hard hitting story of Jake Bishop, a reformed ex-con whose dark past drags him back into a life of crime like an umbilical cord tied tight around his neck. —Paul D. Brazill, author of 13 Shots of Noir.I liked THE BITCH so much that I wanted to publish it. But we lost out and Bare Knuckles Press got a hell of a book. The Bitch is a dark crime fiction story that never once pulls a punch or ducks behind some bullshit like “happy endings” or “closure.” The Bitch isn’t afraid to stay dark until the very end. —Brian Lindenmuth, editor/publisher of Snubnose Press and Spinetingler Magazine.From its opening sentence to its last, THE BITCH is an engrossing journey into some very dark places. Les Edgerton writes like a poet with a mean streak, and his prose goes down easy and smooth like good liquor as it carves up your insides. —Henry Perez, author of Mourn the Living and Killing Red.Imagine, if you will, Les Edgerton, Dashiell Hammett and Raymond Chandler sipping straight whiskey while swapping lies in the back booth of the Linebacker bar as the “noir” legends welcome Edgerton into the brotherhood of broken dreams. With THE BITCH, Edgerton earns his way into this special literary brotherhood. No, The Bitch isn’t a wild woman, but prison slang for “ha-BITCH-ual criminal.” This is a taut tale of double-cross, death, diamonds and destruction as Jake Bishop fights to protect all he holds dear—his freedom, his pregnant wife, and his teen-age brother—by holding The Bitch at bay when trapped into one last job. Sam Spade and Phillip Marlowe could learn a thing or two from this hairdresser.—Bob Stewart, author of Remorse (Pinnacle) a True Crime Book of the Month selection, Hidden Evil, and others. Les Edgerton. I just read his newest hard-boiled effort, THE BITCH, and I realized I didn’t once breathe through the entire thing. Okay, that’s an exaggeration, but it is one of the most fun, dangerous, if not pyromaniac literary performances of the past year (word up is that parts of it are taken from Les’s own life. Holy crap, this guy shouldn’t be alive!). Like Les’s previous bestselling nonfiction effort on writing, HOOKED, this novel is a sure bet.—Vincent Zandri author of The Remains, The Innocent, Moonlight Falls and The Concrete Pearl.Every crime novelist remembers how his breath was literally taken away when he first started to read the early novels of Elmore Leonard. Les Edgerton has used the time he served in prison well. Years from now many future crime writers will also remember discovering him. His first crime novel, but not his first published book, THE BITCH is a realistic crime noir kind of novel that reminds me of Unknown Man 89, La Brava, Stick, and The Killer Inside Me (Jim Thompson). —Joseph Trigoboff, author of The Bone Orchard and The Shooting Gallery.And then, there’s this!Paul D. Brazill and Luca Veste both named THE BITCH on their lists of top novels of 2011.It just doesn’t get any better than this. At least not for me! Watch this space for the announcement of its availability.Blue skies,Les"},

{"title": "Review of Julia Madeleine's novel NO ONE TO HEAR YOU SCREAM", "date": "Wednesday, November 23, 2011", "text": "Hi folks,The term “novel” means exactly that; something original, something new. And, each novel should be exactly that.Precisely what Julia Madeleine’s novel, NO ONE TO HEAR YOU SCREAM is. An original work.For starters, it takes us inside the mind of a brutal criminal. Madeleine isn’t the first novelist to do so, but unlike many who attempt to convey criminals to their readers, hers rings true. As a former criminal myself, I’m perhaps more sensitive to how writers portray outlaws, and to be honest, most get it wrong. Trust me--Julia doesn’t.This is a brilliant character study on several levels. Involved is a teenager with mental issues, a father and stepmother with mental and emotional issues, a criminal with mental issues—in short, a typical dysfunctional family. Seriously, the insights delivered into these characters are brilliant and come on nearly every page.NO ONE TO HEAR YOU SCREAM reminded me in a way of Charles Bukowski’s best story (imo), “The Fiend” in that it delivers a man who is presumably totally evil to most who might know him, but shows the spark of humanity that resides in all of us, even the worst among us.If you like your fiction dark and original and to keep you up late at night turning the pages, this is the novel for you.http://www.amazon.com/No-One-Hear-You-Scream/dp/0980887429/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1322077042&sr=1-1 Blue skies,LesHi folks,I am totally stoked, jazzed, pleased, honored, humbled... all of that... by what respected noir writer and commentator Thomas Pluck posted on his blog today.

{"title": "Two-fer reviews--THE DONOR and AMERICAN COUSINS", "date": "Saturday, November 19, 2011", "text": "Hi folks,I’m going to write a “two-fer” review today. I’m taking a look at Scottish novelist, Helen FitzGerald’s novel, The Donor, along with her screenwriter husband Sergio Casci’s film, AMERICAN COUSINS.THE DONORWhat if you were the only parent of two children and it was within your power to save one of their lives, but not both? How is such a decision even possible? How would you live with yourself whichever child you decided should live? How would the child you decided to sacrifice view you before she died? How would the child you saved regard you?How would you look at yourself, no matter what choice you made?I’ve just finished reading Helen FitzGerald’s novel, The Donor, which poses this very same problem for Will Marion whose wife Cynthia left him years ago for her criminal boyfriend, leaving their twin daughters, Georgie and Kay for Will to raise.Twin daughters who both develop kidney disease and need transplants to survive.I can’t remark on the plot much because it has multiple twists and turns that the reader should discover for him- or herself. Suffice to say that this is a complicated, multi-layered story that surprises at every turn, the tension building until it’s excruciating. Any parent that reads it will be forced to consider their own children and wonder how they’d react—what they’d do in the same circumstance.It’s a brilliant character study of the three main players—the father and his two daughters--as each work through the psychological minefield individually. FitzGerald has delivered a powerful drama, gorgeously writ with grace, black humor, and compassion, and is the kind of literature one seizes upon when encountering its like and proclaims to all who will listen: Read this book!I’m drained.Emotionally spent.How did it affect me?The instant I read the last page, I drove down to my local license bureau and changed my driver’s license so that it showed I’m an organ donor. That’s how powerful it was. As perhaps an interesting aside, in a conversation with Ms. FitzGerald, when I told her what I’d done she revealed that she’d done the same thing in the midst of writing the book. I think many readers will do the same thing. I don’t know of many novels that trigger this kind of action.http://www.amazon.com/The-Donor-ebook/dp/B005685ELQ/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1321728891&sr=1-1 …and then, I watched Helen’s screenwriter husband Sergio Casci’s film, AMERICAN COUSINS.Twice.The first time by myself and then my wife came home from work and I watched it again with her.Simply put, this is what movies, as an art form, are all about. It had every single element a movie should have—intelligent and genuinely funny humor, crime drama, a riveting and thoroughly sweet romance, justice meted out, incredible obstacles, a fantastic character arc, incredible music and wonderful scenery. It made me want to immigrate to Scotland. This is a movie that resonated with me and keeps on resonating. It has a depth to it rarely seen in most films these days. I’m not a fan of romantic comedies, but this one was different. In fact, when I was raving about it to my wife, she asked me if I was sure this was a romantic comedy. Are you sure it doesn’t have any helicopters in it or car chases, she asked, suspiciously. When I told her there wasn’t a single helicopter in it, she put her hand on my forehead to see if I was feverish…I tried to explain to her that while, yes, it was a romantic comedy, it also had “guy” stuff in it. Although no ‘copter crashes there was an explosion… some shooting…The movie is based on Casci’s own family story, when two cousins immigrate from Tuscany, one to America and the other to Scotland, each vowing to the other that whoever made his fortune first would then send for the other to join him.Many years later, although each family has become firmly entrenched in his respective adopted country, they’ve remained in touch. When two of the American family, Gino and Settimo, now Mafiosi, find themselves on the run as a result of a criminal deal gone wrong with Ukrainian bad guys, they decide to take advantage of their family ties by flying to Scotland and laying low in their Scottish cousin Roberto’s home. They’ve assumed he’s cut from the same cloth as the American branch—a tough gangster—but they quickly find out he’s a gentle and peaceful man who, along with his grandfather, owns a fish and chips restaurant in Glasgow. From this fish out of water beginning, emerges a story that’s really got everything—the aforementioned elements—all delivered with elegant understatement. Nothing is over the top as is so often in films like this. The violence has a realistic edge, the romance is bittersweet and not syrupy, and just about everyone in the movie is believable. Many times these days, I’ll see the promo and then go to the movie and that’s the best part of the movie. With this film, they could have picked any part of the movie for a promo as the “best part” and would have been spot on. No weaknesses—it delivers throughout.This is what more movies should be.http://www.amazon.com/American-Cousins-Danny-Nucci/dp/B000KF0NFM/ref=sr_1_1?s=movies-tv&ie=UTF8&qid=1321729031&sr=1-1 Since I’ve read Helen’s novel and seen Sergio’s movie, we’ve become long-distance friends and one time I asked them how they worked. Turns out, they work in the same room and often one turns to the other when he or she encounters a problem and consults with the other. That must be why I feel the same “heart” in each of their works. An amazing couple!Presently, Sergio is working on developing the screenplay from Helen’s novel, The Donor. I can’t wait until it comes out!Another “inside” bit of info I learned. Both artists are in the movie AMERICAN COUSINS. They are the windsurfing couple getting ready to launch their—whaddya call it? windsurfer boat?—in the scene at Loch Lomand. Before I’d seen the movie, I’d researched Sergio on the Internet and saw a handsome dude in the photos with his interviews. Just looked like your average successful movie dude—coifed and dressed ala Hollywood “success” style. Then, I saw the scene where he and Helen appeared… and nearly choked. He didn’t look like the photos I’d seen at all. In the movie scene, he was a bit… how should I say this?... a bit portly. When I mentioned my surprise, he laughed and said as soon as he saw the film, he began a diet immediately…I’m a huge, huge fan of both Helen FitzGerald and Sergio Casci. Check out their work.

To listen to a truly brilliant writer and Hollywood executive who operated at the highest levels of filmland and television delivering useful information for both screenwriters and novelists, listen to her interview at http://www.womensradio.com/episodes/Your-Book-Is-Your-Hook!--Military-Wife-and-Author-Plus-A-Creative-Writing-Coach/10632.htmlSecond, I’ll be participating in my second interview today at 6 pm EST on Giovanni Gelati’s radio blog show The GZone. This should be like a fart in a skillet, as I suggested to Gio that instead of just interviewing me, he might consider some other folks as well, in a panel setting. So, it’ll be moi, plus Cort McMeel and Eddie Vega, founders of Bare Knuckle Press and Noir Nation Magazine, along with Sandra Ruttan and Brian Lindenmuth of Spinetingler Magazine and Snubnose Press. I’ve got stuff coming out from all of these guys, so it should be kind of interesting. Listen to us at http://www.blogtalkradio.com/gelatisscoop. The interview goes live at 6, but if you miss it, it’ll be in the archives and readily available. I’m kind of excited about this and hope lots of you tune in.Blue skies,Les"},
{"title": "Review of ALL THE YOUNG WARRIORS by Anthony Neil Smith", "date": "Thursday, November 10, 2011", "text": "Hi folks,Here's a review I just completed on Anthony Neil Smith's newest novel, ALL THE YOUNG WARRIORS.http://www.amazon.com/All-The-Young-Warriors-ebook/dp/B005ZMHX2G/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1320948332&sr=1-1What a brilliant novel! Alternating between the harsh landscapes of two cultures—frigid Minnesota and the searing heat of Somalia—this novel reports on both worlds without politicizing and without moralizing, allowing the reader to arrive at their own conclusions.What was fascinating for me was that it read as an intense psychological study of very disparate personalities that, at the end, created an understanding and empathy for every single character. With what is really an economy of words, Smith shows a true complexity for each character’s actions. This is a doctoral thesis in understanding how motivations drive people. What’s even more remarkable is that we see four very different people with four entirely different goals and each one is carefully and expertly drawn. There are no “good” guys nor any “bad” guys per se. There are just people who do good things and people who do bad things, with each of the four performing both kinds of actions, but each, no matter what they may do is clearly drawn with not only a deftness rarely seen in but the best of fiction, but each a person driven by forces completely understandable.Very good literature allows us to see into the hidden soul of one character. Literature that deserves the epithet of being great, allows us to see into the deepest recesses of more than one. All the Young Warriors gives us an unprecedented view of all four of the major characters. I’m sure there have been novels which have done this before, but I confess I can’t recall which ones those were, and that tells me perhaps that I haven’t yet read them. Perhaps I just imagine they’re out there…But, I’m not imagining this one.As a writer, I open books for two reasons. One, to be entertained and secondly—which is at least equal in importance to me—to learn how to be a better writer by what and how the author has crafted the work. This novel succeeded on both levels.I simply cannot get over the characters Smith has created. What’s revealing about his craft is how he delivers each character—not through introspection or peeking into their minds, but mostly by their actions. That’s hard to do!First, you have what at first glance appears to be the standard issue cop/detective in thrillers, Ray Bleeker. Quickly, however, he becomes much more than a version of the stereotypical veteran cop solving a crime or mystery. His motivation is powerful. He does what he feels he has to do because of the love of a woman and a sense of honor he feels due her memory. He knowingly sacrifices his future and his life for what he holds to be a just cause. His quest becomes noble and this alone transforms him and makes him different than many similar fictional characters. This is no “Jack Reacher” embued with a superman physique and supernatural physical skills, kicking ass ala a cartoon superhero. This is no “Sherlock Holmes” with a superior intellect. No “Virgil Flowers” with an entire and impressive state crime-fighting bureaucracy behind him. This is a solid detective who can handle himself physically but isn’t a superhero, able to vanquish a dozen ninja warriors, but just a better-than-average fighter who’s getting a bit long in the tooth. His detecting skills are not inborn in him by virtue of some detective “gene,” but have been acquired by years on the job and from intelligent observation gleaned from many cases. He’s kind of an Everyman and what distinguishes him is the level of love he holds for a woman and his child. He embodies what used to be known as “Yankee ingenuity.” He doesn’t own a bunch of power tools; he owns an inventive, practical mind. What distinguishes him from other popular detectives in fiction is that he has a character arc. He is a man who will be an entirely different person at the end of the story, unlike most series characters who remain largely unchanged by the struggle they go through.The second major character, Mustafa Abdi Bahdoon, was utterly fascinating. Easily the most complex character in the cast. At one time a powerful gang leader, feared by friend and foe alike, he has long since walked away from his past and is living the “straight” life, working at a Target store. This, despite the knowledge that he might be murdered at any time by his former gang members. He’s of Somalia extract, but all he wants to do is be American, despite his violent background. He also is driven by love. The love of his son.His son, Adem, is as complex as the others, and shows perhaps the biggest character arc of all. He begins as a college student who is somewhat popular, but possessed of a follower’s personality. He’s the dutiful child, who gets swept up unexpectedly in politics and a murder and ends up in Somalia as he flees a murder charge and prison time, and at first is idealistic about the cause he has joined, but soon discovers he has neither the firmness of belief in that cause that is necessary but that he’s pretty much a coward. He mostly remains a coward until near the end and through a series of events, he becomes a sort of Goebbels. Why Goebbels, you ask? Well, because that’s kind of what I was reminded of in this story—it could have been structured from a study in how two powerful Nazis became who they were. Adem is Goebbels and the last character…Jibriil… is the “Hitler” character. Indeed, I kept thinking of Hitler as Jibriil moved through the pages. Not the finished-product-Hitler, whom most see in their minds’ eye, ruling over the Third Reich as the hob-booted despot he became, but the Hitler who was a failure as a painter and mostly a nobody until he found himself in the right place at the right time and took advantage of the situation. Jibriil is the young Hitler, at his late childhood and early rise to power. What is fascinating is that through Smith’s depiction of his character, it becomes clear how an insignificant nobody can emerge as a cruel tyrant like Mein Fuhrer when the planets align and the circumstances allow.I may be the only one who looks at this novel this way, but I can’t help seeing these kinds of parallels. Whether Smith intended it or not, he’s created a case study in how otherwise ordinary folks, under the right circumstances, can become the Hitlers of the world and how the same thing can happen today. And perhaps is.What is one of the most amazing things about this book is that every single one of the major characters undergoes a significant character arc. How in the hell does Smith do that?! That’s remarkable. In practical terms, that means this novel is perfect to be made into a movie. You’ve got not one, but four characters A-list actors would kill to play.This is a brilliant book, possibly the best novel of the year. It's for sure in the top three or four. I've read more great books this year than I ever have--great time for top novels!Blue skies,Les"},
{"title": "HOOKED... for free?!", "date": "Monday, November 7, 2011", "text": "Hi folks,Well, I woke up today thinking it would just be another ho-hum day in Mudville... when I clicked on an email from an editor I really respect and discovered that Writer's Digest was offering my book HOOKED for free! (It wasn't a WD editor who notified me.)Now, I know how Anthony Neil Smith (Doc Noir) felt in his blogpost: http://anthonyneilsmith.typepad.com/hermansgreasyspoon/2011/11/theyre-giving-away-my-book-for-free-the-bastards.htmlMy sentiments, exactly... Although, I have a sneaking suspicion Mr. Smith's publisher let him know what they were going to do before they did it. And, they only did it for a day... And, I'll bet he gave his okay.What bothered me is that WD didn't see fit to let me know that they were doing this. Did I say \"bothered me?\" I guess that's the most accurate terminology to describe my initial reaction where I kicked my cat, threw a book through the window, cursed at the top of my lungs, and some other similar actions...The thing is, I don't believe in ever giving away my work for free. Perhaps WD knows that and is why they didn't inform me. I know there are writers out there who profess their desire is only to \"get people to read them.\" Well, that ain't my desire at all, unless they pay for the hours and days and weeks and months and years it took to get that book written. I rarely see plumbers giving away free work to \"get people to notice them.\" Figure my work is just as valuable...I understand the impetus behind this \"freebie\" thing. That it create a fan base who will then buy other work. I guess. I'm just not a believer in this strategy.Maybe it will turn out just fine. Just went to the Amazon site and saw Hooked's rank:  Amazon Best Sellers Rank:                    #8 Free in Kindle Store (See Top 100 Free in Kindle Store)                                              .zg_hrsr { margin: 0pt; padding: 0pt; list-style-type: none; }.zg_hrsr_item { margin: 0pt 0pt 0pt 20px; }.zg_hrsr_rank { display: inline-block; width: 50px; text-align: right; }       #1      in Kindle Store > Kindle eBooks > Nonfiction > Reference > Writing > Fiction Now, I'm not as mad as I was... I don't know what to think. Maybe they know what they're doing. The other thing that bothered me was that it was done as a promo for NaNoWrit or whatever they call it. That's an event I'm solidly... against. In fact, I tell my students I recommend they avoid participating, as in my opinion it only leads to bad writing habits. But, that's me. I do have many friends who participate in it and if they enjoy the experience, I'm glad for them. I just think it doesn't lead to many positive things for a serious writer. And, since I think it's more of a negative thing for a writer who wants to create good writing habits, I kind of resent my book is being given away free to promote it. I realize my thoughts here may alienate some folks. That's okay. If a writer doesn't have an opinion and is unwilling to express it, what kind of writer is that? One who would do well working for Pravda, I guess... Not this boy-o.I have nothing whatsoever against anyone who takes advantage of Writer's Digest largess... I'd do the same thing. In fact, I emailed some friends to alert them that they could get it for free and even Twittered about it. If you can't fight 'em, join 'em... At least if folks can get a free copy, I'd rather it be people I know and like.I think what bothered me the most was that WD couldn't even be bothered to let me know what they were going to do. The author isn't important in these things, I guess. It occurs to me that this may be one of the contributing factors to the demise of print publishers... how they view their authors and how they value their input and opinion, especially of their own work.Now, I'm going to lie down and try to practice my own philosophy of \"not letting others rent space in my head.\"I just wish I had the power to give away all of Writer's Digest books for the next year... And not let them know until it was a done deal... Tell 'em if they didn't like it, too bad--it's in the contract...Sign me:One-pissed-off-writer Les  P.S. What gripes me is that Hooked was still on a number of Amazon's best-selling lists, mostly in the UK and other European lists..."},
{"title": "REVIEW OF ED LYNSKEY'S NOVEL LAKE CHARLES: A MYSTERY NOVEL", "date": "Thursday, November 3, 2011", "text": "Hi folks,When I first picked up Ed Lynskey’s novel, Lake Charles, I was excited to read a book set in a place I used to live and had fond memories of—Lake Charles, Louisiana. As I began reading, I got a bit confused as the setting didn’t sound anything like the place I’d lived in.Turns out, it wasn’t. The Lake Charles of Lynskey’s novel was another lake entirely, a man-made body of water created by the TVA in Tennessee.Also turns out, it didn’t matter. This was as dark and as Gothic as anything else Southern, and it could have worked just as well if it had been set in the Louisiana town of the same name.And, it is dark and very Gothic! Atmosphere up the yazoo. Or… kudzu… Precisely my cup of tea. An absolutely amazing novel.Rather than go into the plot points, which others, better qualified for that kind of stuff do a better job than I ever could, I just want to talk about my visceral reactions. First, I never consciously seek out symbolism in novels. Symbols mostly just get in the way of enjoying the story. But, there are some in here that were so well-done and so organic to the tale that not only did they not interfere with the reading pleasure, but caused it to transcend what will be termed “genre” literature by some into something I feel would more accurately be looked at as simply literature. Good and even great literature.The lake itself is the most pervading character in the novel. Its water is slimy, odoriferous, and malignant. I’m assuming Lynskey intended it to stand for things manmade, things our modern civilization have wrought to what used to be a wondrous example of nature with a capital N. It reminded me of what uber-agent Donald Maass once related to me as being one of the elements that all great books contained—a magical place. A physical place in the best novels where seminal events took place. We were talking about that at a workshop we were both appearing at a couple of years ago, and it dawned on me that he was exactly right. “Like the street in Dennis Lehane’s Mystic River,” I exclaimed. “The story begins there with the boy’s kidnapping and it comes up at crucial times and ends there—in the movie with the Sean Penn character, where he slumps to the curb when he realizes the monstrosity of his murder of that same boy now grown, years later.”“Exactly,” Don said, and we were off to a discussion of similar mystical/mythical places in literature.Well, add Lake Charles to that list. Like Dennis Lehane with his Boston Southy street, like Raymond Chandler with L.A., like Ellen Gilchrist with New Orleans, like Russell Banks with various locales—Lynskey has made a setting a living, breathing character.A dark,foreboding, malignant, malevolent character. Since reading this book, I’ve seen the lake in my nightmares at night and I always awake drenched with sweat. Only the best of books have that power and this one qualifies. It’s a story of loyalties—both familial and friendship, a tale of the evilness of drugs and what they’ve done to society, and, in the end, and for me, most of all it’s a look back at the days of my youth growing up in East Texas where people took care of their problems themselves and if it took violence to enact justice, well, violence is what took place. We didn’t look for the police or the courts or lawyers to solve our problems, but acted as men and took care of them ourselves with whatever it took. In these days of “social consciousness” or whatever they call it, taking matters into one’s own hands is frowned on and will likely get you called out on talk shows, but… man-oh-man! I long for those days!This is a vigilante novel and an example of how vigilantes aren’t always the bad and nasty thing they’re often made out to be. It seems to me that this and novels and movies of this sort are hugely popular simply because there are a lot of us who long for those “good old days” when people took care of their own problems and didn’t depend on others. Brendan Fishback, the protagonist, hooks up with his best friend’s father, Mr. Kuzawa, as they team up to avenge the murder of Kuzawa’s son and Brendan’s best friend, Cobb, and to find the kidnappers of Brendan’s twin sister Edna by the same folks, and the result is Southern justice of the sort that makes you jump up and cry: “Yeah!” when they triumph over evil.This is just one of the best novels I’ve read this year, simply put.Blue skies,Leshttp://www.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_sb_ss_i_0_12?url=search-alias%3Dstripbooks&field-keywords=lake+charles+by+ed+lynskey&sprefix=lake+charles"},

{"title": "MAGNA CUM MURDER is the place to be in October!", "date": "Sunday, October 30, 2011", "text": "Hi folks,I returned late last night from attending and participating in the Magna Cum Murder festival in Muncie, Indiana at Ball State University, and had an absolutely lovely time!While there were a lot of authors there who I’ve seen at events such as Bouchercon, there was a decidedly different atmosphere. Less frenetic and a bit quieter, but very satisfying. While Bouchercon is made up more of thriller writers such as Lee Childs, Joe Finder, Anthony Neil Smith, Joe R. Lansdale and the like, Magna is home to a bigger contingent of mystery and suspense writers, although there were several thriller writers in attendance as well. Although, it turns out that many of those I’ve just named have been at this festival in the past. I think perhaps the reason it’s a bit less frenetic is that there aren’t any agents (or any that I was aware of, anyway), and most of the folks in attendance were there mostly as fans of mysteries and suspense, including the writers themselves. A place to enjoy the genres without business being conducted. And these folks were the best-informed audience I've ever seen.My main initial motivation for attending was to meet author John Gilstrap in person. I’ve been an admirer of his thrillers for a long time and we even connected on the phone awhile back when we were introduced to each other by blog radio hostess Jennifer Wilkov after we’d both appeared on her Women’s Radio Show. One of the organizers of the MCM festival, Austin Lugar, graciously put me on a panel with John and we had a great time!While meeting John was a decided highlight, I met and became friends with a number of other fantastic writers. Folks like Con Lehane (my new best friend…), Ruth Dudley Edwards, Jim Doherty, Mike Lawson (my smoking friend…), Deni Dietz (my other smoking friend), W.S. (Wendy) Gager, David Walker, T. Lee Harris, Marian Allen, Gwen Mayo, Maris Soule, and Cathy (Cat) Akers-Jordan (not a writer, but a teacher and knowledgeable fan, with whom I had a great conversation with her and her mom, Ginger Jordan. Got to meet Parnell Hall, an amazing writer who has had enough experiences to fill at least six memoirs.I was on two panels. On the first, I was totally out of my element! It was a game-show panel where we debated along with the audience to figure out who the world’s best detective was. The only problem I had was I was only familiar with one of the names—Harry Bosch. I’d read novels featuring the others, but far, far back in the mists of time and didn’t recall enough about them to be able to argue their merits. In spite of that, it was fun, mostly because this is a nonjudgmental audience and nobody called me out on my ignorance. In a series of emails back and forth before the conference, between us participants and the moderator, Austin Lugar, in trying to determine the detectives we’d be debating over, I was thoroughly intimidated by one of the panelists, Ruth Dudley Edwards, and in fact, emailed Austin, telling him I was scared to death of her and asking that he sit me away from her—she terrified me! Well, as it turned out, he seated her next to me… and I’m glad he did. Turned out she’s not a bit scary, but a thoroughly delightful person. Besides having a REALLY BIG BRAIN, she's the sweetest person on earth. The others on the panel were Parnell Hall, W.S. (Wendy) Gager and Con Lehane.What was great about this panel was that Harry Bosch won! If you’re only going to know one of the contestants, it pays to know the winner…The second panel was the one I had really been looking forward to. It was moderated by my hero, John Gilstrap, and included my new best friend, Con Lehane, my smoking buddy, Mike Lawson, the aforementioned Ruth Dudley Edwards, and the festival guest speaker, Bob Brier (aka Mr. Mummy) who is the best-known Egyptologist and mummy expert working today. Our panel’s mandate was to discuss how our jobs have affected our writing. My “job” that I discussed mostly was my days as a criminal… When I told what my job was, half the audience on my side moved over to the other side…I’m kidding! It was a great panel and we had a wonderful time and the audience was super.I met so many interesting writers and I know I’ll leave somebody out. One guy who was really cool was Jim Doherty, a real-life cop who currently is the police technical expert on the Dick Tracy cartoon strip.Deni Dietz was really cool. She’s a senior editor for Five Star Mysteries and told me to send her a query. Working on that now… She has had a fascinating life, including being a jazz singer in the French Quarter. I’m trying to remember if I’d ever seen her perform as it turns out we both lived there at the same time.All the meals were provided for by the festival and were the best I’ve ever had at such a gathering. Simply delicious!Alas, I had to leave early before the Saturday night banquet. I sprained my back a few months ago and it’s never recovered fully and it began acting up and put me in enough pain I had to leave for home early.All-in-all, this was one of the coolest writer’s festivals I’ve ever had the pleasure of attending and honor of participating in. The folks who run it are true pros and every one a book lover and knowledgeable about the mystery and suspense genres. If you ever get a chance to go to the annual Magna Cum Murder, I recommend it heartily!Blue skies,LesBookmark their website for next year’s festival at http://www.magnacummurder.com/"},

Please be advised to keep this from your young kids and relatives who have a burr under their saddle over cursing and X-rated humor… *New Rule: Stop giving me that pop-up ad for Classmates.com! There's a reason I don't talk to people for 25 years. Because I don't particularly like them! Besides, I already know what the captain of the football team is doing these days: mowing my lawn and applying fertilizer. New Rule: Don't eat anything that's served to you out a window unless you're a seagull. People are acting all shocked that a human finger was found in a bowl of Wendy's chili. Hey, it cost less than a dollar. What did you expect it to contain? Trout? Luckily, it was only a finger! If it was a whole hand, Congress would have voted to keep it alive. New Rule: Stop saying that teenage boys who have sex with their hot, blonde teachers are permanently damaged. I have a better description for these kids: lucky son of a guns. New Rule: Ladies, leave your eyebrows alone. Here's how much men care about your eyebrows: do you have two of them? Okay, we're done. New Rule: There's no such thing as flavored water. There's a whole aisle of this shit at the supermarket - water, but without that watery taste. Sorry, but flavored water is called a soft drink. You want flavored water? Pour some scotch over ice and let it melt. That's your flavored water. New Rule: Stop messing with old people. Target is introducing a redesigned pill bottle that's square, with a bigger label. And the top is now the bottom. And by the time Grandpa figures out how to open it, his butt will be in the morgue. Congratulations, Target, you just solved the Social Security crisis. New Rule: The more complicated the Starbucks order, the bigger the idiot. If you walk into a Starbucks and order a \"decaf grande half-soy, half-low fat, iced vanilla, double-shot, gingerbread cappuccino, extra dry, light ice, with one Sweet-n-Low and one NutraSweet,\" ooh, you're a huge idiot. New Rule: I'm not the cashier! By the time I look up from sliding my card, entering my PIN number, pressing \"Enter,\" verifying the amount, deciding, no, I don't want cash back, and pressing \"Enter\" again, the kid who is supposed to be ringing me up is standing there eating my Almond Joy. Paper, plastic? I don't have time for that. I've just been called to do a cleanup on Aisle Nine! New Rule: Just because your tattoo has Chinese characters in it doesn't make you spiritual. It's right above the crack of your ass. And it translates to \"beef with broccoli.\" The last time you did anything spiritual, you were praying to God you weren't pregnant. You're not spiritual. You're just high.New Rule: If your mom is still driving you to school, you’re not a “gangsta.” Pull your pants up so we don’t have to see your crack. It isn’t nearly as attractive as you might think.New Rule: Competitive eating isn't a sport. It's one of the seven deadly sins. ESPN recently televised the US Open of Competitive Eating, because watching those athletes at the poker table was just too damned exciting. What's next, competitive farting? Oh, wait. They're already doing that. It's called \"The Howard Stern Show.\" New Rule: I don't need a bigger mega M&M. If I'm extra hungry for M&Ms, I'll go nuts and eat two. New Rule: If you're going to insist on making movies based on crappy old television shows, then you have to give everyone in the Cineplex a remote so we can see what's playing on the other screens. Let's remember that the reason something was a television show in the first place is the idea wasn't good enough to be a movie. New Rule: No more gift registries. You know, it used to be just for weddings. Now it's for babies and new homes and graduations from rehab. Picking up the stuff you want and having other people buy it for you isn't gift giving, it's the white people version of looting. New Rule: and this one is long overdue: No more bathroom attendants. After I zip up, some guy is offering me a towel and a mint like I just made it with George Michael. I can't even tell if he's supposed to be there, or just some freak with a fetish. I don't want to be on your web cam, dude. I just want to wash my hands. New Rule: When I ask how old your toddler is, I don't need to know in months. \"27 Months.\" \"He's two,\" will do just fine. He's not a cheese. And I didn't care in the first place.*JOKEMy girlfriend and I had been dating for over a year when we decided to get married. My parents helped us in every way, and my friends encouraged me. My girlfriend? She was a dream! There was only one thing bothering me.That one thing was her younger sister.My prospective sister-in-law was twenty years of age, wore tight miniskirts, and low cut blouses. She would regularly bend down when near me, and I got many a pleasant view of her underwear. It had to be deliberate. She never did it when she was near anyone else. One day little sister calls and asked me to come over to check the wedding invitations. She was alone when I arrived. She whispered to me that soon I was to be married, and she had feelings and desires for me that she could not overcome and did not really want to overcome.She told me that she wanted to make love to me just once before I got married and committed my life to her sister.I was in total shock and could not say a word. She said, \"I'm going upstairs to my bedroom, and if you want to go ahead with it just come up and get me.\"I was stunned. I was frozen in shock as I watched her go up the stairs. When she reached the top, she pulled down her panties and threw them down the stairs at me.I stood there for a moment, then turned and went straight to the front door. I opened the door and stepped out of the house and walked straight toward my car. My future father-in-law was standing outside. With tears in his eyes he hugged me and said, \"We are very happy that you have passed our little test. We could not ask for a better man for our daughter.

(Getting Seattle people to look at each other is an accomplishment.) So once we got airborne, I took out my laptop and typed up what she said so I wouldn't forget. I've left out a few parts I'm sure, but this is most of it.\"Before takeoff... Hello and welcome to Alaska Flight 438 to San Francisco. If you're going to San Francisco, you're in the right place. If you're not going to San Francisco, you're about to have a really long evening. We'd like to tell you now about some important safety features of this aircraft. The most important safety feature we have aboard this plane is... the flight attendants. Please look at one now. There are five exits aboard this plane: two at the front, two over the wings, and one out the plane's rear end. If you're seated in one of the exit rows, please do not store your bags by your feet. That would be a really bad idea. Please take a moment and look around and find the nearest exit. Count the rows of seats between you and the exit. In the event that the need arises to find one, trust me, you'll be glad you did. (This is excellent advice, and something I always do.) We have pretty blinking lights on the floor that will blink in the direction of the exits. White ones along the normal rows, and pretty red ones at the exit rows.In the event of a loss of cabin pressure, these baggy things will drop down over your head. You stick it over your nose and mouth like the flight attendant is doing now. The bag won't inflate, but there's oxygen there, promise. If you are sitting next to a small child, or someone who is acting like a small child, please do us all a favor and put on your mask first. If you are traveling with two or more children, please take a moment nowto decide which one is your favorite. Help that one first, and then work your way down.In the seat pocket in front of you is a pamphlet about the safety features of this plane. I usually use it as a fan when I'm having my own personal summer. It makes a very good fan. It also has pretty pictures. Please take it out and play with it now.Please take a moment now to make sure your seat belts are fastened low and tight about your waist. To fasten the belt, insert the metal tab into the buckle. To release, it's a pulley thing -- not a pushy thing like your car because you're in an airplane -- HELLO!!There is no smoking in the cabin on this flight. There is also no smoking in the lavatories. If we see smoke coming from the lavatories, we will assume you are on fire and put you out. This is a free service we provide. There are two smoking sections on this flight, one outside each wing exit. We do have a movie in the smoking sections tonight ... hold on, let me check what it is .... Oh here it is; the movie tonight is Gone with the Wind.In a moment we will be turning off the cabin lights, and it's going to get really dark, really fast. If you're afraid of the dark, now would be a good time to reach up and press the yellow button. The yellow button turns on your reading light. Please don't press the orange button unless you absolutely have to. The orange button is your seat ejection button.We're glad to have you with us on board this flight. Thank you for choosing Alaska Air and giving us your business and your money. If there's anything we can do to make you more comfortable, please don't hesitate to ask.If you all weren't strapped down, you would have given me a standing ovation, wouldn't you?After landing... Welcome to the San Francisco International Airport. Sorry about the bumpy landing. It's not the captain's fault. It's not the copilot's fault. It's the Asphalt.Please remain seated until the plane is parked at the gate. At no time in history has a passenger beaten a plane to the gate. So please don't even try.Please be careful opening the overhead bins because \"shift happens.\"*            Posted November 21, 2007 01:03 AM November 21, 2007 01:03 AM    woodman i haven't heard from you in a while. thought i'd give you an update.I'm writing this slow because I know you can't read fast. We don't live where we did. my wife read in the newspaper that most accidents happen within 20 minutes of your home, so we moved. I won't be able to send you the address because the last family that lived here took the house numbers when they moved so they wouldn't have to change their address. This place is really nice. we even has a washing machine. I'm not sure it works so well, though, Last week I put a load of clothes in and pulled the chain, we haven't seen it since. The weather isn't bad here. It only rained twice last week; the first time for three days and the second time for four days. About that coat you wanted me to send, the wife said it would be too heavy to send in the mail with the buttons on, so we cut them off and put them in the pockets. i locked my keys in the car yesterday. i was really worried because it took me two hours to get the wife and kids out. my sister had a baby this morning, but I haven't found out what it is yet so I don't know if i'm an aunt or uncle. The baby looks just like my brother. Uncle Bobby Ray fell into a whiskey vat last week. Some men tried to pull him out but he fought them off and drowned. We had him cremated; he burned for three days. Three of my friends went off a bridge in a pickup truck. Butch was driving. He rolled down the window and swam to safety. my other two friends were in the back, they drowned because they couldn't get the tailgate down. hope you and the family have a good thanksgiving. if you get by the piggly wiggly save me some yoo hoo's.Your Favorite websta 20dad.Hope you enjoyed these!

{"title": "Review of Nigel Bird's novel, SMOKE", "date": "Thursday, October 20, 2011", "text": "Hi folks, http://www.amazon.com/Smoke-ebook/dp/B005UO9USY/ref=sr_1_1_title_0_main?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1319128108&sr=1-1  What a delight Nigel Bird’s novel, Smoke was to read! Not simply because it was a crackling good story, wondrously told (which it is), but it was simply refreshing since it began with the depantsing of a young boy and then centered around a dog fight. In these days in this country (U.S.) of rampant Political Correctness gone absolutely amuck and insane—when great books such as Huckleberry Finn are sanitized to suck the very marrow out of their brilliance to satisfy some politicized bullshit group or other who aren’t satisfied to run just their lives or thoughts but want to control the rest of us, refreshing is precisely the word to describe work like Bird’s. With groups of grim-faced citizens who appear to have sphincteritis extremis along with a secret handshake and generous funding for television ads seeking to control the rest of us—it seems to be up to the Brits to show us what this freedom of speech thing that we read about in history books is all about.Personally, I like dogs. I find most breeds to be fine eating, and, if harvested at younger ages, approaching gourmet status, particularly when sage is used judiciously and not overmuch.This is a great piece of fiction that shows us a world many aren’t exposed to—that’s a value in itself—but more, it shows how young boys are shaped by the cruelty visited upon them. Now that is valuable. If Jimmy hadn’t been depantsed, if he hadn’t grown up in a world of gamblers and dog fights and people rendered cruel and hard by their circumstances, if he had instead received that moronic version of family life ala the Beave and his kin, then he might have turned out to be a nice man, living in the suburbs, fussing over his lawn, and looking forward to each day selling life insurance and playing golf on the weekends and wondering if his medical insurance will buy his Viagra. But, he didn’t, and neither do millions of other young boys. And, it’s a good thing when a novelist shows us these worlds we perhaps aren’t exposed to. It’s a good thing to see how life smacks down people and shapes them in ways that aren’t good. How else would we know? And if we don’t know, how  can we ever hope to change lives and conditions of living?From billboards and bumper stickers?Get this novel. It’s the real deal.Blue skies,Les"},

It's about voter registration fraud in St. Joe County (IN), where the Democratic Chairman, Butch Morgan, has resigned over the furor. Well, Butch and I are old friends, dating back to our days as classmates at Indiana University at South Bend (IUSB). He was the party co-chairman of our student party when we ran for student body offices. I ran for the president's gig and was elected. In fact, our entire slate was elected.This past Saturday my wife Mary and I attended the wedding of Courtney Felabom, the son of a mutual friend, John and Angie Felabom. One of the reasons I was anxious to attend was that Butch Morgan was supposed to be there and would be sitting at our table. Well, he never showed up. This morning I got an email from Angie sending me the article on Butch's resignation and we figured out why ol' Butch was a no-show...Interesting times... and more interesting friends...Hope you catch the radio interview!Blue skies,Les"},
{"title": "REVIEW - Luca Veste's story collection LIVERPOOL 5", "date": "Wednesday, October 12, 2011", "text": "REVIEWLuca Veste’s Story CollectionLIVERPOOL 5Trestle PressI bought Luca Veste’s story collection and intended to read it after two other books I had on my queue but I made the mistake of looking at the first page.There went the ol’ queue! I couldn’t put it down. The very first story, “Dreams” was spellbinding—it just pulled me in and I was caught in the undertow. It was like taking a graduate course in philosophy, except it wasn’t delivered in dry, academic tones, but with a voice that grabbed me from the first sentence when it described an old guy sitting on a bench. Who can resist an old guy sitting on a bench? Maybe you can but not me. I always sit down next to such a person in real life and begin talking—the wisdom of the world resides in such people. And, so it was with “John.” The best stories always make one think. This one did… about my own dreams. A great story always poses more questions than it answers—they open up whole new worlds of possibilities. This one did just that.The next story, “Model Behavior” was a complete surprise, especially the black humor ending. I’ll never look at Facebook the same way…“Heavy Sleeper” got me immediately, beginning as it did with a character exactly like myself—my wife tells me the same thing as his wife did—that a bomb going off couldn’t wake him. Same here. As he says about any potential burglars, “I’d make the shittiest guard dog this side of Cerberus.” Guilty… And then it takes a monster turn that caught me completely off-guard! I won’t spoil it for you, but this one was my favorite.Next up was “Peeling Spuds” and it’s my co-favorite of the collection. I love black humor and this was the blackest and the funniest. Veste also takes a female pov here and does it beautifully.“He Ain’t Heavy” created a surreal, wonderful, wacko world, with an intellectual brother at odds with his thug of a brother coexisting in a criminal family. Like all of Veste’s stories, the reader is set up until we feel comfortable in the fiction world he’s created—and just when we’re at ease enough to put our feet up on the coffee table and sip the coffee he’s graciously provided… he blindsides us, sucker-punches us, knocks the crap out of us!Delicious!In all of his stories, I experienced a physical reaction akin to whiplash. I’m trying to think who writes better endings than Veste and I can’t think of anyone who does so as consistently.I had one small problem with this collection. There wasn’t enough. I want more! The good news is there’s a rumor he has another collection about ready to go. Hurry up!http://www.amazon.com/Liverpool-5-ebook/dp/B005UO9QHO/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1318441674&sr=1-1 Blue skies,Les"},
{"title": "Review - BEAST OF BURDEN by Ray Banks", "date": "Tuesday, October 11, 2011", "text": "Hi folks,I tried to write a worthy review of Ray Banks' novel, BEAST OF BURDEN, and feel like I failed miserably. I just don't have the words to do it justice. Here's what I came up with and all I can say is... you gotta read this book!  BEAST OF BURDENByRay BanksReviewhttp://www.amazon.com/Beast-Burden-Cal-Innes-ebook/dp/B004X7U0I8/ref=tmm_kin_title_0?ie=UTF8&m=AG56TWVU5XWC2 Wow. A world like the one I existed in when I was in my salad criminal days and which I’m pretty sure still exists intact. Where the cops have no morals and the outlaws do. I frickin’ loved this novel! And, I loved/hated the ending! I won’t spoil it here, but man! All I’ll say is that it fits perfectly Flannery O’Connor’s definition of a perfect ending—that it completely surprise and come clear out of left field, but that upon reflection it be the only possible ending. (That’s badly paraphrased, but I hope you get what I mean.)Banks is just one of the best writers writing today. Period. I can’t think of another book that so clearly reveals the real relationships between lawdogs and outlaws than Beast of Burden does. Banks understands. Understands both criminals and cops and understands them perfectly. Never have I read an account of this world that is this true.This isn’t so much a review than it is a collection of scattered thoughts. For instance, I identified immediately with Cal Innes. He’s a character not only unlike any I’ve ever encountered in fiction—he’s also a character I related to with a kind of weird reason. Not only is he a criminal like I was for a long time, but he’s also suffered a stroke. That was eerie as I suffered a series of ten mini-strokes (TIAs) a couple of years ago. Not only that, but like myself, he keeps on smoking. I couldn’t tear my eyes away from him during the entire novel. Who writes characters like this? No one but Ray Banks could and carry it off. This just felt like my story, not simply because of the physical condition of Innes, but more in the way he sees the world and his place in it. And the cop, Donkin (the Donkey, as he’s called derisively, by his enemies on both sides of the law and there are many), is like the best cops I’ve ever known. He’s driven by his own terrible moral code which is much the same as is his chief foe, Innes. For those of us who’ve been career criminals, there is always a nemesis like Donkin. A guy you hate and a guy you love, but above all, a guy you respect. He’s no pussy.Above all, this is a moral novel. Not in the traditional Judeo-Christian sense (although that’s part of it), but in the same sense as Borges’ novels are. Or Camus’ or any of the best existential writers. In other words, this is as far from Disney as one can get. I feel very inadequate to describe this novel accurately and all I can say is this: You’ve got to read it. It’s a clash of titans and it’s one of those few books that has already become a part of me and one that I’ll always remember. It was overwhelming.I’m so thankful for intelligent writers and intelligent books!Blue skies,LesPaul D Brazill's You Would Say That, Wouldn't You?: Ride My Pimp: BlogTalkRadio-an interview- and a gu...: Yes, I do  put it about, don't I?

{"title": "THREE NEW NOVELS YOU GOTTA READ!", "date": "Monday, October 10, 2011", "text": "Hi folks,I’m posting reviews I just wrote on a few of my friends’ work and thought I’d share them here. The first is a noir crime novel by Allan Guthrie titled SLAMMER and it’s a beaut! Allan told me he was worried I’d find something wrong with it since it was set in prison and… well, you know… I spent time in prison. He shouldn’t have worried in the least. It’s pitch-perfect and if I didn’t know better, I’d guess he was in the cell next to me in J-Block. It’s that accurate. It’s set in a Scottish prison but there doesn’t seem to be much of an appreciable difference between the two. Mr. Guthrie is renowned as one of the best crime and noir writers extant and it was both a privilege and an honor to review his brilliant work.The second book featured here is by my good friend Bob Stewart. Bob and I keep dancing around the possibility of co-writing a book together but I’m kind of afraid I wouldn’t be able to hold up my end to match his considerable writing chops. Bob has written some truly fantastic books. For a long time, he wrote true crime and his NO REMORSE is one of the best true crime nonfiction books I’ve ever read. He’s switching to fiction these days and his fiction chops are every bit as good as his nonfiction ones. He’s been busy these days as this is his second novel released just this year. Check out the synopsis and my review of HIDDEN EVIL following the one for Allan Guthrie.The third is by gritty Irish crime writer, JJ Toner, which features a truly memorable protagonist, DI Ben Jordan in a wonderful read where you’ll need to buckle up or suffer possible whiplash at the twists and turns it makes. You'll want to read ST. PATRICK'S DAY SPECIAL.I hope this works—having both an Irish and a Scottish writer here together… Bob may have to referee…SLAMMERByAllan GuthrieReview by Les EdgertonThis is going to sound odd, but the whole time I was reading Allan Guthrie’s brilliant novel, Slammer, I kept thinking about a writer I’d read back in the eighties, James Kelman. I couldn’t figure out why Kelman kept cropping up at the edge of my brain as I turned the pages, so I went and found a copy of Kelman’s How Late It Was, How Late, and reread it, trying to figure out where the connection was.I thought at first it was the subject matter—both books deal with prison, albeit one centers on a guy in prison and the other (Guthrie’s) has a protagonist who is a guard, or as we call ‘em here in the States, a hack.But, that wasn’t it. It really bothered me. Then, I thought perhaps it was that both were Scottish. Now, I felt I was getting closer to uncovering the connection my mind was making.And then, it dawned on me. It was the world-view of both writers—their cadence of their expression. I knew then why I had joined two writers of different eras together. It was the same visceral feeling I got when I first read James Lee Burke and Joe R. Lansdale and Anthony Neil Smith and Harry Crews—the feeling that I was reading the spiritual descendents of William Faulkner.It was a geographical thing—no—more—it was a geographically political thing. While Mssrs. Burke and Lansdale and Smith and Crews all employ particular voices and all are different from Faulkner’s (as well as similar), there is an undercurrent in all that make them related. I was seeing the same thing in Guthrie and Kelman. It’s a cultural thing I suspect. I wish I could articulate it better than I am here and I may well be far off-base, but I feel what I feel.Stories are more than a plot and characters doing interesting things. The very best of our literature goes beyond that and allows the reader to see inside an intelligent mind. That’s what happens with Guthrie’s books. We see that dark place within that only the very best of writers ever get to and it’s the definition of honesty many seek but most grow weak when approaching and end up settling for an approximation of truth. Guthrie gets it.What all the writers I’ve named here have in common is a dark view of existence. One that I share in my own outlook on life. Which is why I’m so attracted to this sort of writer more than any other.As an ex-con, I’m leery of novels set in prisons. The vast majority get it wrong. It becomes clear immediately that their knowledge of prisons comes from TV and bad movies. When I encounter terms like “shiv” and the like, I quickly put the book in the “send to the used-book sale” pile. Slammer is the real deal. When I was reading it, my hands began to sweat and I had to put it down often and take a walk outside and smoke a cigarette or two. I’ve been out of prison for decades now and for the first twenty years experienced nightmares. They’ve been absent for many years now, but they came back while reading this book.And that’s all right. I’ll forgive Mr. Guthrie for this. I may have gotten back the nightmares for a time, but I also received something very important. Genuine and raw feeling. And that’s worth a lot.He gets it exactly right. When I was in the joint, our biggest source for drugs was always the hacks. Either directly or by their complicity. For an apt example, there were two brothers—one inside the walls and one outside—and on visiting days the free brother would visit. They had to plan their visits for when a certain guard was on duty. On those visits, the brothers wore identical shoes, and at some point during the visit, they’d simply switch shoes. Each had hollowed-out heels. In the inmate’s would be the “green” (real money) he’d collected for the previous week’s drugs, while his brother’s kicks held smack. If a righteous hack had been on duty, they wouldn’t have been able to make the switch. The thing is, without guards, a lot less drugs would find their way to prison populations and that’s exactly what Guthrie’s guards are doing.Right on point.Alexis-Charles-Henri Clerel de Toqueville said something to the effect that nations are judged by the quality of their prisons. From Kelman to Guthrie, I think I have a pretty good idea of Scotland.Get this book!http://www.amazon.com/Slammer-Allan-Guthrie/dp/0151012954/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1318430794&sr=1-1And here’s the skinny on Bob Stewart’s new book:HIDDEN EVILSynopsis:After a drug-addled teenager turns the annual Battle of Flowers Parade into a bloodbath, Majorette Cindi Neff - photographed blood covered and screaming beside the body of a dead classmate - becomes the media symbol of the tragedy, and the object of cult leader Juan Otero's obsession.Soon after his burial, the gravesite of Cindi's dead classmate is violated and Deputy Sheriff Nancy Neff, an expert in Afro-Caribbean religions, is called to the scene. Minister Luke Oeding, a representative for the bereaved family, joins Nancy in the investigation into this unimaginable crime.In a deadly chess match of good versus evil, they plunge into the world of the South Texas drug cult and come face to face with Palo Mayombe, the darkest of the hidden religions. When Cindi Neff is kidnapped, Nancy and Luke race to save her from the clutches of the malevolent cult before she is sacrificed in an Easter Sunday Palo Mayombe ritual.Les Edgerton says:\"Bob Stewart's new novel, HIDDEN EVIL, is ripped directly from today's headlines about drug smuggling on the Texas border. This puts a face to the horrors that we seem to see daily on the evening news. Deeply-disturbed characters, facing what they see as a black future, turn to drugs and the occult and what follows…human sacrifice. It's a tale that begins with a Columbine-style massacre and ends on Easter Sunday in a classic battle between good and evil. I don't read vampire or werewolf novels simply because I don't believe they exist and it's a bit difficult to conjure up any kind of delicious fear by pretend monsters, but these folks are real and quite possibly living on my block… so, yeah… it pushed my fear button. After I read it, I slept with the nightlight on for a week. Get this book. It's truly scary and it's damned fine writing and story-telling.\"http://www.amazon.com/Hidden-Evil-ebook/dp/B005TUFB3C/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1318270780&sr=1-1And finally, here’s my review on JJ Toner’s new book, ST. PATRICK’S DAY SPECIALSt. Patrick’s Day Specialby JJ TonerReview by Les EdgertonSecure your seat belt before embarking on this ride! Just a warning to expect twists and turns aplenty on JJ Toner’s wild crime ride. I’d say that this was a page-turner and if I was just reading to be entertained that would be true. But, I’m also a writer and I had to keep stopping to make notes on his techniques that I plan to steal for my own writing! I’ll leave it to others to deliver the plot points—I’ll just say that the tension never leaves the page and Ben Jordan doesn’t spiral down into the abyss—he plunges into it head-first. And, lest you think all is grim on the Toner landscape, the black humor he employs at just the right moment lightens the read with delicious and perfect pitch. Get this book and then keep your eyes open for his next one!http://www.amazon.com/Patricks-Day-Special-Jordan-ebook/dp/B005JPEGKG/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1318270932&sr=1-1 Enjoy!Blue skies,LesP.S.

{"title": "TENSION IN STORIES", "date": "Thursday, September 22, 2011", "text": "Hi folks,I think I've posted this before, but if I have it's been some time so I hope you'll find it useful. This is one of the handouts I use for my writing classes and portions of this appear in both of my writing books, FINDING YOUR VOICE and HOOKED.          Tension is the stuff of great stories. In fact, without tension, there is no story, at least in terms of literature. Tension is easy to explain, sometimes difficult to execute. It can also be called crisis or conflict. Without the element of tension, stories fall flat.          Consider this: Dick gets accepted to Harvard, graduates magna cum laude, lands a job in a top Wall Street investment firm. While there, he meets Gwen, a beautiful investment counselor. They begin to date and a year later marry. They have twins, a boy and girl who grow up to be wonderful children, earning top grades in school and eventually progress to adulthood, go to good schools, marry well and give their parents terrific grandchildren. Gwen and Dick never have a fight, invest wisely for both themselves and their clients, and become wealthy. Perfectly compatible, they read the same books, enjoy the same movies, and end up dying in their sleep together at the age of ninety-four. Their funeral is well-attended by the rich and famous, all whom have loved and adored the lucky couple.          A nice story...in real life...but a complete washout as a fictional story. Their story is interesting only to themselves and perhaps their friends and relatives, but to anyone else it is a major snooze.          Now, make Dick black and Gwen white and Dick has an enemy...and you have a story (Othello). Or, they have a great love for each other but Gwen’s married (Anna Karenina). Or, he loves her with everything he’s got but she only goes for him after he’s exhausted his passion (Gone With The Wind).          Mel McKee, an editor and teacher, tells his students that “a story is a war. It is sustained and immediate combat.” He gives four rules for writing a story.                   (1) Get your fighters fighting, (2) Have something --the stake-- worth their fighting over, (3) Have the fight dive into a series of battles with the last battle in the series the biggest and most dangerous of all, (4) Have a walking away from the fight.          A story is about a character wanting something intensely and there is an impediment to his or her goal. That’s it. Keep in mind, the thing the character wants need not be something huge and spectacular, but the character must want whatever it is with great intensity. In David Madden’s novel The Suicide’s Wife, the protagonist wants nothing more than to get her driver’s license, but she feels her identity and future depend on getting that license and a corrupt highway patrolman tries to manipulate her and because she wants her license so badly it becomes a terrific story.          A result of watching too many bad movies and TV series and reading too many potboiler melodramas, is that beginning writers sometimes feel that the best way to introduce drama into their fiction is by way of murders, airplane crashes, bank robbers and the lot, not realizing most roadblocks to desires in real life are much closer to home, in the form of our own personalities, bodies, friends and families and make for much better literature. More passion, says Janet Burroway in Writing Fiction, is destroyed at the breakfast table than in a time warp.          Kurt Vonnegut speaks about story tension in an interview in the Paris Review, when he says,                   When I used to teach creative writing, I would tell students to make their characters want something right away even if it’s only a glass of water. Characters paralyzed by the meaninglessness of modern life still have to drink water from time to time. One of my students wrote a story about a nun who got a piece of dental floss stuck between her lower left molars, and who couldn’t get it out all day long. I thought that was wonderful. The story dealt with issues a lot more important than dental floss, but what kept readers going was anxiety about when the dental floss would finally be removed. Nobody could read that story without fishing around in his mouth with a finger.          What we as writers want to do to our readers is keep them wondering and worrying. So long as they are doing that, they are turning the pages. The easiest (and perhaps best) way of doing this is by raising story questions at the very beginning. A story question is a device to make the reader curious. They aren’t put in question form, but are statements that require further explanation, problems that require resolution, forecasts of crisis, and the like (from James N. Frey, How to Write a Damn Good Novel). A knock on the door late at night. (Question: Who could be there?) Jim meets Nancy on the train. (Question: Will they like each other?) Betty didn’t believe in ESP. (Question: Will this disbelief be put to the test?)          These kinds of beginnings are very effective in creating tension in stories and they can be answered very quickly or they can be long-range story questions that won’t be answered until near the end of the story. Beware of story questions that don’t become fairly irrelevant to the story; the question must not only get the reader involved in the story, it should be justified by the story that follows. If it is a question that isn’t the main question of the story, it must logically lead to that question.          Poor openings that are often used, are openings such as Frey describes in his book:·         Ginger’s bedroom had striped wallpaper on the walls and a desk under the window. (questions raised: none.).·         Ocean City was no place to have fun at night, so Oswald decided to go to bed early and read about how to make a paper airplane. )This is a negative story question; the reader doesn’t want to read on because he doesn’t want to be bored.).·         The old Ford had a rusted paint job and a horsehair seat that smelled like an old pair of sneakers. (Again, no question being raised-description only.).·         The warm sea breeze blew in through the open window and the moon overhead was a golden globe on the horizon of the Santa Cruz mountains. (Sounds like a fiction story all right, but it isn’t going to hook a reader.).          On the other hand, here’s some examples of good opening questions:·         The cold passed reluctantly from the earth, and the retiring fogs revealed an army stretched out on the hills, resting. As the landscape changed from brown to green, the army awakened, and began to tremble with eagerness at the noise of rumors. (The Red Badge of Courage. Question: What are the rumors?)·         Someone must have traduced Joseph K., for without having done anything wrong, he was arrested one fine morning. (The Trial. All kinds of story questions are raised here. Why was he arrested? What will happen to him? Who turned him in and why?          To create anxiety in the reader, you must create a sympathetic character, one who most readers will want to see good things happen to. And then, throughout the story, the reader should be worrying about bad things that will happen to the character.          Tension is created by first creating story questions, putting the sympathetic character(s) in a situation of menace (to their goals), and lighting the fuse, thereby making the reader wonder and worry.          Keep in mind that sympathetic characters are not always wholesome characters - they can be the worst individuals on the face of the earth, but there must be something about them that the reader can identify with. That is what is meant by “sympathy” in the literary sense. In the novel, The Silence of the Lambs, Hannibal Lector is definitely not the traditional protagonist that inspires sympathy in the common acceptance of the term (in the nonliterary sense), but he represents an intellectual strength and control over his emotions that many wish they had. This makes him sympathetic in literary meaning. The word sympathetic in literature doesn’t mean we have sympathy for him or her; it means there is something inherent in the character that we admire or desire for ourselves, in Lector’s case, intellectual strength. The fact that he is helping catch another serial killer is his redeeming feature that can allow us to identify with him as readers and keep turning the pages to see what happens.          Once you have established tension with your story question, you must keep it going. And escalating to a final act of epiphany in which the main character is changed forever.          Janet Burroway gives a good example of such a story ending and epiphany when she gives us a story outline about two brothers on a fishing trip who struggle with each other. The protagonist, for most of the story, holds his older brother in contempt, only to discover at the end of the story that they are really bound together by love and family history. This is a clear epiphany, a mental reversal. An immature writer might mistakenly signal this change in a section whereby “suddenly Larry remembered their father and realized that Jeff was very much like him.” Doesn’t work. Why? Because even though the realization is internal, it must be manifested in an action so the reader is able to share the experience and thereby be moved with the character. The way it should be portrayed is - Jeff reached for the old net and neatly bagged the trout, swinging round to offer it with a triumphant, ‘Got it! We got it, didn’t we?” The trout flipped and struggled, giving off a smell of weed and water and fecund mud. Jeff’s knuckles were lined with grime. The knuckles and the rich river smell filled him with a memory of their first fishing trip together, the sight of their father’s hands on the same scarred net...          Here is a memory, leading to a realization, and it was triggered by an action and sensory details the reader can share. Do you see the difference? There has to be a physical action that leads to the moment of realization that is what makes story...story.          Another technique to avoid like the plague, is the “John Wayne rescue”. This was the hallmark of many bad Westerns and other movies and poorly-written stories. This occurs when the wagon train is circled by Indians and all appears lost...and out of nowhere the cavalry appears to rescue them. Don’t do this! This is just simply bad writing. The ability to resolve a conflict must come from within and it should be foreshadowed, not foisted as a complete surprise on the reader as something completely foreign to the situation. Also, don’t use this technique (John Wayne rescues) to further the action. There is an awful movie that every now and then makes it rounds on late-night television you may have seen that illustrates this. (Just shows you Hollywood will put out anything)          I forget the name of the movie, but the plot line is based on a man and woman being trapped inside a new-fangled, high-security office building they can’t get out of until Monday morning. I also don’t remember why, but a thug is chasing them around the building trying to kill them. They’re out on ledges, running down stairwells, etc. Lots of grubby, stereotypical \"action\" of the lowest rank. At one point, about midway through the movie, the man and woman somehow miraculously get the drop on the bad guy and knock him out with a staple gun. At this point, the movie fails, because they drop the staple gun and leave the unconscious villain and begin running again. This is a grave insult to the viewer’s intelligence. In a life and death situation like this, anyone with any brains at all, would either finish the bad guy off or if they have moral qualms about killing, would stay with him and every time he came to they’d knock him out again. Or tie him up or something. But no, these geniuses elect to start running again. They’re so dumb as characters you want the bad guy to whack them out just for their stupidity. This bit was written into the story just to advance the plot and keep the action going. It’s a trick and any intelligent viewer is going to switch the dial off at this point or walk out of the theater, assuming that they value their time and don’t wish to waste it on movies for the terminably brain-dead. Whenever you get to a place in the story where basic common sense dictates one course of action and you, as writer, have the characters take another (let’s call it an “idiot” course), just to advance the story, then the story is doomed. So beware.          In today’s world, good fiction echoes life itself in that there are no clear or permanent solutions, that the conflicts of character, relationships and the universe can’t be permanently resolved. There are no more “and they lived happily ever after” kinds of stories, at least ones that anyone would want to read. But the story form demands a resolution of some sort. Take a war story, for example. After the initial skirmish, after the guerrillas, after the air strike, after the poison gas and the nuclear bomb, two survivors emerge from a shelter. They crawl, then stumble to the fence that marks the border. Each grasps the barbed wire with a bloodied fist. The “resolution” of this battle is that no one will ever win. There will never be a resolution, and this epiphany leads the reader to realize a change has been effected from the opening scene in which it seemed worthwhile to initiate a skirmish. In the opening question of conflict was contained the possibility that one side or the other would win; in the resolution of the story it is clear that no one can ever win. (From Janet Burroway’s Writing Fiction)          To sum up, one effective way tension is created is from the onset by use of a “story question”. (Created by the inciting incident - will (s)he resolve the problem?) It is then escalated by a series of incidents in which the protagonist tries to resolve the question, until when all else has failed, there is one last scene in which by his or her own initiative, and triggered by an action, the question is resolved, for bad or good. Out of this must come a change in the situation from whence he or she began, a shift in the main character’s thinking, belief, or take on life. You might look on “story” as someone traveling down a path and the things that happen to him on that trek take him down a different fork in the road in the end than he or she initially intended to or was even aware of.Hope this helps in your own writing!Blue skies,Les"},

{"title": "Review of THE PERFECT CRIME by Carl Brush", "date": "Tuesday, September 6, 2011", "text": "Hi folks,My friend Carl Brush just posted a review of my latest novel, The Perfect Crime, on his blog (http://writerworking.net/) and I’m sharing it here with you. Thanks, Carl! REVIEW Just a couple of weeks ago (Sept 15), WW had the pleasure of commenting on a Les Edgerton work (Just Like That) and here we are again with The Perfect Crime Both of these are on Kindle for not much money, and I recommend immediate downloads.The Perfect Crime takes off like a bullet and doesn’t let up till it smashes into its own surprising, yet inevitable, ending. Charles “Reader” Kincaid is a bad actor with an ingenious mind. He cooks up a terrific plot to garner revenge and a few million dollars at one and the same time. The plan involves having the money stolen by proxy so he doesn’t have to dirty his hands or risk capture, and doing it in a way that will deliver maximum damage to the object of his ire. On the way from Dayton, Ohio, to New Orleans, where he plans to deliver his coup de Grace, Reader picks up an entourage he’d rather not have along on this particular journey. Grady Fogarty is a retired cop whose brother Reader murders as he develops his plan. However, evidence is thin, and with the perp seemingly headed across jurisdictional lines, the chances of nailing him--ever--seem to be the old combo of slim and none. Grady’s obviously not satisfied with that, so he gases up and heads south.It takes some fierce detective work and some new alliances with other ex-cops of entertaining and fascinating character to even pick up the genius-criminal’s trail, and even more of all that to stay on it. Edgerton follows the actions of several major characters so that we’re in constant suspense if and how and when their circumstances will intertwine. Grady naturally stumbles into some hot romance along the way, and their “first time” scene--because it’s set up just right and is not particularly graphic--is one of the juiciest you’ve ever read.  No more plot from me. The joy of discovering that and the intricacies of the characters you’ll get from reading the work, not the reviews. I will say, however, that despite the fact that this is a novel of action, we end with a rather philosophical question about what is, strictly speaking, legal and what is just. Nice. END OF REVIEW Thanks, Carl. I’m glad he noticed and pointed out the sex scene—I think it’s the best one I’ve ever written and the most original. And, as he points out, it’s not graphic in any sense.Blue skies,LesAdd a Comment"},

{"title": "BOOKTRACK--LAUDED AS VISIONARY AND INNOVATIVE... BUT IS THERE A DOWNSIDE?", "date": "Friday, August 26, 2011", "text": "Hi folks,You might want to look at this link before reading what I have to say about it. http://www.pw.org/content/booktrackWhile there, check out the videos provided, especially the one titled “Booktrack Interview with James Frey.”Booktrack is the new technology that provides sound tracks for e-books. On the surface, it sounds like a great idea, one that will enhance the reading experience vastly. But… is there a downside?Well… perhaps. Okay. Yes.One factor the proponents of it (James Frey, for one, is pioneering its use), don’t mention is that it changes what has always been, to use Marshall McLuhan’s terms, a cool media into a hot one. For those who are perhaps somewhat removed from the sophomore communication classes on McLuhan’s theories we sat through at ol’ State U., he divided media into two basic categories—“hot” and “cool” media.In basic terms, a hot media is one that is low in audience participation because more than one sense is involved. Examples are movies and television where more than one sense is involved, i.e., sight and sound. Sensory experience trumps intellectual.Cool media are media where audience participation is much higher. Examples are books and radio, where only one sense is involved—sight in written material, and sound in radio broadcasts. Intellectual experience trumps sensual.The fewer senses involved, the higher the degree of audience participation. The participant in a cool media, like a novel, has to bring something to the table to be able to enjoy the experience. That “something” is imagination. The same for radio. We hear the broadcast, but rely on our imaginations to furnish the context. We see the words in a novel, but rely on our imaginations to furnish the context.Basically, the cooler the media, the more the mind and intelligence of the participant are engaged.A reader is much more engaged in the experience than a movie-goer, who basically sits in his or her seat and lets the sound track and visuals furnish most of the experience. In other words, a cool media requires mental and intellectual participation; a hot media, much, much less. Everything is done for you in a movie and the participant basically sits there and lets the media take over much of the brain’s functions. Reading a book, on the other hand, requires the reader to engage intellectually in the experience. i.e. to think, to bring the imagination to the table. The more senses employed, the less the participant has to do and he/she basically becomes a passive subject. The fewer senses employed, the more the participant has to become active to enjoy the experience. The receiver must fill in the missing information. Indeed, that’s a factor in determining good writing from poor writing—the more the writer fills in for the reader, the lower the quality of the material. As Hemingway pointed out, good writing is like an iceberg. Nine-tenths of the iceberg is below the surface and invisible; only one tenth is invisible. A quality novel requires effort on behalf of the reader—a good book is a participatory exercise where both the author and the reader need to do some work.Some argue that the emergence of hot media is the main factor involved in the “dumbing down of America.” We sit and absorb movies and television and our brains just aren’t engaged much. When we read something, our brains are awakened and engaged or else we don’t get much from the experience. Those who believe that movies and television destroy intellectual activity (I’m in that camp) point out that attention spans and comprehension levels have fallen drastically with the advent of movies and TV and in a direct correlation to their rate of popularity. It’s a solid and fairly scientific argument.The more society tends toward hot media over cool, the less the intellect is accessed and falls further into disuse.Hot media are low in audience participation due to their high resolution or definition. Cool media are high in audience participation due to their low definition (the receiver must fill in the missing information).Which brings us back to… Booktrack.While whatever I say here will have little or no effect upon the future of soundtracks in books—the genie is out of the bottle and nothing will stuff it back—I’ll at least have the satisfaction of delivering a bit of a warning for some not to embrace it without thought about the consequences.Booktrack is simply a move toward removing the intellectual factor from the act of reading and making the reading experience “easier.”It’s instructive to watch the video titled “Booktrack Interview with James Frey” (available at the link provided above), and listen to Brooke Geahan’s remarks as he describes the experience he had, where the “reading itself disappears and he’s transported into the movie” (badly paraphrased, but you’ll see what I mean.). Sounds much like the experience movie-goers have of suspending thought processes during a well-made movie with high production values. Pleasurable experience, for sure… but at what expense? It appears to me that sensory pleasure overrides intellectual pleasure.Booktrack is absolutely going to become a player in the world of e-books—I don’t see anything holding the tsunami back. But—what will this new world of books going to do to our minds, to our intellectual abilities?I’m curious as to your thoughts on this… I’m anticipating a lively debate. Probably mirroring the older one over books vs movies… With excellent points on both sides…Blue skies,LesP.S. Before anyone thinks I'm against movies, not so! I go to lots and lots of movies and enjoy many of them. I do read far more books than I view movies however."},

{"title": "CARL BRUSH REVIEW OF DOCNOIR'S \"CHOKE ON YOUR LIES\"", "date": "Wednesday, August 24, 2011", "text": "Hi folks,Here's another review from my friend Carl Brush on Anthony Neil Smith's novel, CHOKE ON YOUR LIES.                                                                                                       HOME \rWriting \rBLOG--REVIEWS AND ESSAYS \r                                            Common civilian question to writers: “Where do you get your ideas?”  Sort of like asking “Where do you get your next breath.” However, I’m on  the verge of asking Anthony Neil Smith where he comes up with these protagonists and their sidekicks. Choke on your Lies features a guy who is just as incompetent as Billy Lafitte (see Writer Working on Hogdoggin’ and Yellow Medicine, August 15 and 17), but 180 degrees different. Where  Lafitte likes to punch, kick, shoot, fuck anything in his way, Mick  Thooft is afraid to even approach his obstacles. He’d  rather pretend he  doesn’t really want to go where he’s headed or try to find a way  around, or just give up. How can a writer expect a weak character like  that to carry a whole book? Give him Octavia Vanderplaats, 350 pounds of  brilliance and an unparalleled mixture of cruelty and love. Octavia  likes to control people, but she is to our normal idea of a “control  freak” what Al Capone is to a shoplifter. She not only steers peoples’  behavior her own way, she consumes them. If the Stockholm syndrome is  named after a city, she’d need a nation to label the syndrome that she  visits on folks under her spell. The only thing she and Mick seem to  have in common is their Dutch names. But you know how those high school  friendships can hang on over the years.    So when Mick’s wife tries to  destroy him via divorce, Octavia wants to “punish the bitch” while Mick  yearns for understanding, even reconciliation. Even while they uncover  more and more of “Frannie’s” salacity and cruelty, he resists bringing  down the hammer. In the meantime, Octavia, plows ahead without him, then  drags him along after the deed is done. It’s a fascinating dynamic,  having the protagonist trying to slow the action while his sidekick  keeps the pedal the metal on every page.     Another thing. I have a prejudice  against novels of academia. They’re mostly full of pompous know-nothings  with latte’s instead of blood in their veins. Even my favorite, Robertson Davies,  suffers from the syndrome. I don’t doubt that Smith intended the  Yeats-quoting Thooft (nothing against Yeats, the juice and soul of 20th  century poetry. Love him. But not the way Mick misuses him.) as a satire  of that set of pretentious idiots. I thank Smith for that and for  another docnoir triumph. I’m not sure whether to thank him for the  relatively neat, wrapped up ending. I’m still waiting for the return of  Billy Lafitte.  From Carl Brush's website http://writerworking.net/This is just another brilliant novel from \"DocNoir.\" Enjoy!Blue skies,Les"},

My heartfelt thanks to those who've taken the time to write and review it. I'm on my way to your houses with a case of Harp and a bottle of Jack to properly thank you... 1 of 1 people found the following review helpful:                5.0 out of 5 stars          Harrowing Read, August 21, 2011                By Sharon Z McMeel  - See all my reviews         This review is from: Just Like That (Kindle Edition)       This book riveted me to my seat. Mr. Edgerton is a writer who really  captures not only the details of the inner workings of a criminal mind;  but the whole world of prisons and a crime spree road trip across parts  of urban and rural America. My husband is really the crime fiction buff  in the family, and I'm more of the Keruoac \"On the Road\" fan. But Mr.  Edgerton's writing really had a powerful prose style that makes the  reading experience a \"literary\" one...albeit with more violence and  bloodshed than \"On the Road.\" But I must admit I could not stop turning  the pages of JUST LIKE THAT. I'm glad this was recommeded to me and I  plan on reading more of this author's original and exciting work.

As a female who mostly reads women  authors with female leads, I felt a tad strange about my immediate  fascination for Jake. This con was unlike anyone I knew personally or  read about in other novels, and the idea of rash criminal behavior  without provocation sent a chill through me. Still, night after night I  broke promises to myself to read only three or four chapters. With a  story that seemed surreal in its unfamiliar setting, lingo baffling as  hell, yet as much fun as learning a foreign language, and testosterone  practically seeping through my Kindle, I couldn't believe how easily I'd  been hooked. Les did what all writers hope to do; kept this reader  thinking about events and characters from the book for days. God knows I  never want to find myself inside a place so dreary and dangerous,  however I'm suddenly Jonesin' to read about modern day life inside a  female prison.

Be sure to allow enough time to finish it in one sitting--it's a  can not put down novel based mostly on Edgerton's own life experiences  (85%) --it is gusty, gritty and authentic.

{"title": "NOVEL-WRITING CLASS OPEN", "date": "Sunday, August 21, 2011", "text": "UPDATE: The class has been filled and thanks for the wonderful responses. I've begun a list for the next class for those who didn't make this one and there's a few spots left for it but not many. I appreciate your responses very much!Hi folks,I’m opening up a private online creative writing class (on novel writing) that begins next week to those who are interested. To be able to devote the proper time to each student, the class will be limited to ten people. We have five openings at the present time. Those interested, please email me at butchedgerton@comcast.net for information on both the class and enrollment procedures.Those interested in auditing the class—which would allow the auditing person to receive and view everything the rest of the class does, but not be able to participate actively, solely as an observer. The fee is substantially less for auditors than participating students. Basically, auditors will sit in on the class as an observer. There will be a very limited number of auditors and I will qualify those who are interested. Some in class are uncomfortable with very many observing their work and our exchanges as, to be honest, many of our comments are brutally frank. Students know and welcome this, but to someone not directly participating they can see it another way. There won’t be any interaction at all with auditors—they’ll be there simply to use the knowledge they might pick up for their own writing or even their own teaching through their observations.Pertinent info:This class will be conducted in the same way I conduct university classes, most recently for Phoenix College, i.e., in a workshop format. What that means is each week participants will send a designated number of pages to both me and the other members of the class. When I receive each person’s work, I’ll provide comments/criticism/suggestions to improve for each student on their work and then send it back to them and the others in class. Each person in class does the same for each other—reading and providing comments on each other’s work and sending that back to the class and me. It’s exactly like being in an “on-ground” workshop. I’ve found over a lifetime of teaching classes—beginning with the UCLA Writer’s Program—that this is the single best method of learning. There is a synergy at work with this model. Many writing classes consist of the student sending work in and the instructor commenting. That’s okay, in a limited way, but when you have ten others plus the instructor or workshop leader commenting, the value of the class increases almost exponentially. Students, very often, offer wisdom that the instructor by him- or herself doesn't have or doesn't offer for various reasons, including time.I believe in road maps when embarking on the lengthy journey a novel entails; therefore, I ask each student to submit a 15-20 word outline of their proposed novel. I don’t have the space here to explain how that works, but I send a handout on how to create such an outline before the class begins, and it serves to keep the writer focused on their novel throughout its creation and also helps the workshop leader and her classmates see instantly if the writer is focused or meandering. I’m a firm believer in beginning a novel in the proper place and once that is achieved, the remainder of the novel becomes infinitely easier to create. We’ll spend the most time on a writer’s novel beginning than any other part of their novel.This class will be composed of students who’ve previously taken classes with me along with newcomers. To be able to serve each level of student fairly, students who are well along into their novel and have taken previous classes, will be able to submit up to ten pages per week. New students who haven’t taken my class, will be allowed to submit up to five pages per week, and, once they’ve achieved a proper beginning, will then be able to send ten pages. Please know that this may sound like favoritism, but it’s not at all. The beginning of a novel is the single most crucial part of writing a novel, imo, and I spend more time on that than anything else. I’ve learned over many years, that a great many writers have a poor understanding of a novel’s structure and it’s crucial that a sound knowledge of novel structure (particularly beginnings) be achieved before devoting much time to the rest of the novel. I’ll spend as much or more time on the newer student’s five pages than I will on the more experienced writer’s ten pages. Please feel free to query those in class who’ve been with me before as to their opinion and I feel certain they’ll agree with me. I’ll be happy to furnish names and email addresses for those writers should you wish to ask their opinion.Each week, I also send at least one handout to the class on some element of writing, as well as other pertinent info that’s useful. Along with the handout on outlining, I'll send a handout on proper formatting in the first batch. Every writer should know how to present material professionally no matter where they are in their craft.Be forewarned that this workshop isn’t for the faint of heart! Some have termed it “Bobby Knight bootcamp for writers.” In “real life” I’m not a mean person, but with writing I’m not going to hold hands nor hand out false praise. That’s what writing groups are for and they do it well. I expect each person to participate fully and comment on each other’s work just as they would want others to do the same for theirs. I don’t tolerate very well, those who keep making the same mistakes week after week. For example, the proper and professional format is explained at the beginning and each class there are always one or two who keep making the same, easily-fixed mistake. Here’s a common example: One of the format rules is that there is only one space between sentences in computer-generated material. Many older writers, in the typewriter days of yore, were taught to use two spaces. The kernaling in computers is different than typewriters and using two spaces is a sure sign of an amateur who hasn’t kept up with current usages and just another red flag a writer ought to avoid. I understand it’s a hard habit to overcome—I had to do the same myself—but there is an easy way to relearn this which we give, and even if it takes awhile to relearn this, a writer can at least do a final edit before sending work in and correct this. To not do so, indicates to me a writer who doesn’t respect either themselves or their fellow writers or the teacher. Frankly, I don’t want to waste time with this type of writer. I’m not speaking of the writer who makes occasional mistakes, but of the one who continually keeps making the same mistake after it’s been pointed out.Writing well isn’t easy. It’s hard. If someone has told you that writing is easy, they’ve lied to you. Typing is easy; writing is hard. Our aim in our class is to help writers create publishable work. By reputable publishers, not vanity presses.If I haven’t scared you off, here are the particulars:1. Fee is $300, payable in advance and nonrefundable. For those who can’t afford the full amount at one time, you may make three equal payments of $120, for total of $360. Auditor’s fee is $100.2. Each week, you’ll send to the entire group and me, your pages. You’ll also receive work from your classmates to read and provide comments on. The comments aren’t intended to be scholarly or exhibit some high degree of technical knowledge. We just want to know what worked for you in the writing and what didn’t. If you can articulate why it did or didn’t, fine, but that’s not necessary.3. To help make the class run smoothly, there will be deadlines each week. For instance, if the class begins on a Monday each week, you’ll send in your work by that day. Then, by Thursday, you’ll send in your comments on each other’s work. I’ll send my comments to each of you by Saturday night. Then, the next week begins on the following Monday.4. Often, the class and I kind of hit a wall. It’s pretty intense. To account for that event, we may take a week hiatus and return the following week. In fact, you can pretty well count on that.5. We don’t expect a student to be a professional writer at all. It’s a class, not an advanced degree program. Our aim is to help each writer become better at their craft as a result of the class, and to learn how to professionally submit material, and to hopefully end up creating work that is publishable legitimately.6. While I would never say I would recommend students to agents or publishers, very often I do. The people who finish the class almost always have progressed to the point where their work is, indeed, publishable, and when that happens I’m eager to introduce them and their work to gatekeepers.7. Beginning date of this class will be Monday, August 29. All enrollments must be completed and paid for by Thursday, August 25. Enrollment will be on a first-come basis and there are five spots remaining. There will be a limited number of auditors, subject to my approval.8. Required reading will be my book, HOOKED, and Jack Bickham’s book, SCENES & STRUCTURE. Recommended reading will be Janet Burroway’s WRITING FICTION.If anyone is interested and has more questions, please feel free to email me at butchedgerton@comcast.net.Thank you,LesP.S. If this class goes well, I plan to follow with other classes. If anyone would like to join a list of interested writers for future classes, just let me know. I also coach individual writers during the creation of their novels and the fee for that service is $100 per hour. If interested, I will be happy to share how I work and also to put you in touch with clients for their feedback and opinion.Hi folks,Just interested in your views and opinions on e-books vs printed books. Is it one or the other in your view or do you see a place where both have merit? Does your opinion stem from a reader’s mindset or as a writer?I’ve experienced a reversal in the past year. A year ago, I saw nothing I liked about e-books. Of course, that was before I purchased a Kindle. My opinion was that I loved “real” books—I loved the way they looked, the way they smelled, the way they felt in my hand. I had the idea that reading a book on an e-reader was most likely to be the same experience as when I read anything on the computer screen. I did it because I had to for some material, but never enjoyed it.In fact, when I had a new book coming out, I had an entire set routine. I smelled it--wonderful smell! Especially when it’s your book! Then, I reread it even though I’d pretty well memorized it already from all the rewrites and edits and galleys and all of that. And then… I slept with it. Truth.I knew I wouldn’t ever be able to capture that feel with an e-reader.But… like a lot of things… I was wrong.My first experience with an e-reader was when I downloaded the free Kindle version for my desktop. The first book I read on it pretty well confirmed my suspicions. It wasn’t a cool experience at all. It was exactly what I thought it would be. Like reading something from Wikipedia on my ‘puter.If I would have gone by my experience with the desktop, I might not ever have gotten my Kindle. But, the fact is, more and more books I wanted to read were only available as e-books. Not to mention that other books I wanted to read that were also in print were infinitely cheaper and quicker to obtain as e-books, rather than the print version. To get the print copy, I had to either physically travel to a bookstore or else order off the Internet. Ordering copies took time—when I bought a book on my Kindle, I received it in mere seconds. Not only did I save on the cover price, I saved on the gas I would have used in going to the bookstore, the time I saved as well as the ease—and, not to mention, the bookstore might not have any available copies. Ordering off the Internet took time and cost me postage. Convenience-wise and price-wise, e-books have enormous advantages.But, the biggest factor of all was that with the very first book I read on my Kindle I found that it felt even better in my mitts than a physical book did! I was shocked to discover that. It didn’t smell like a new print book, sure, but the fact is that new books don’t really have all that much of a smell anyway. It’s more of a delusion we feed ourselves, to be honest. And, to be honest, although book-sniffing is more socially acceptable than say, bicycle-seat sniffing, neither would be in most folks Top Ten sensory experiences to be savored...What’s happened is that I thought I read a lot of books in my pre-Kindle days—I’d average three novels per week. That has doubled these days with my Kindle. I’m averaging almost a novel a day now. I take my Kindle everywhere—it’s actually easier to carry around than a novel. It’s certainly easier to carry around than a number of novels and that’s what I carry these days. As of this morning, I have almost 200 novels on my Kindle and I’m nowhere near its capacity. I can be at the doctor’s office or anywhere and I’m not stuck with just the novel I brought with me. There's another advantage my Kindle has--I can upload the manuscript I'm working on to it and work on that wherever I am. I also review books for fellow writers and when I'm waiting in the dentist's office and I get tired of reading the novel I'm on, I can pull up my friend's mss and read it. To have the material that's on my Kindle and available within seconds, I'd have to tote around a wheelbarrow of print versions. And, I've got a bad back so Kindles are better for my health...I also read it in the bathtub. I throw that in because I read a post on a blog where someone made a joke that they couldn’t read their e-reader in the bathtub. Fortunately, I’m blessed with at least average coordination and have never dropped mine. I suppose if one had some kind of debilitating disease that rendered them unable to hold onto something that weighs a few ounces they should probably stick to print books, but I’m blessed in that I can walk and chew gum at the same time and a Kindle in the tub isn’t that insurmountable obstacle to have to overcome that some would claim. And, if I did have an accident and dropped it into the tub and ruined it—well, the truth is I’ve saved enough from buying e-books rather than the print version that I’ve already saved enough to have paid for half a dozen Kindles. And, if it did “drown” and I had to buy a new one… well, all the books I’d already bought would appear on my new version. If I dropped a print book, I’d just have a swollen, unreadable book…The more I think about and consider the arguments against e-books in favor of print books, the more I see the same kinds of arguments Luddites always make. Actually, I’m old enough to remember when we changed from chiseled stone tablets to papyrus and the arguments today seem similar. I remember well when that happened. No longer did I have the pleasure of relaxing in the cave with a novel where the pages weighed ten pounds each. Now, those were novels for he-men! You couldn’t be a sissy and heft those things to peruse! And then, I’d just gotten used to papyrus—talk about the smell! now there was a smell you couldn’t get with paper—imagine sheepskin and a rainy day—if you dropped one of those puppies in the bathtub you really had a smell experience (you’ve smelled wet wool, right?)—and then the printing press came along and I had to change all over again and give up all the pleasures of papyrus and animal skins. It never ends! They just keep throwing all these dang changes at us!I think that many folks today who are resisting e-books for the “smell” the “feel” and all that are kind of in the same camp as people were at any change in books. For those who are of that mindset, I do have some barrels of whale oil. If you’re still resisting electricity I can give you a great price…Another thing to consider--those who ignore history are doomed to repeat it. Check out the historical clamor when electricity came along, especially in the New England whaling burgs... Maybe I'm fibbing a little when I say I \"remember\" stone tablets and papyrus and sheepskins--but I do remember when paperbacks came on the scene and there were thousands of literary Chicken Littles running around screaming that the skies were falling and so was \"literature.\" Turned out about the same way as I see e-books turning out.

{"title": "NEW NOVEL GOES LIVE THIS WEEKEND--THE PERFECT CRIME", "date": "Friday, August 19, 2011", "text": "Hi folks,Things are heating up! My second novel from StoneGate Ink, THE PERFECT CRIME, goes live and will be available this weekend! Hope y'all will considering glomming onto a copy. As soon as it is available, I'll post links to Amazon and Nook. As with JUST LIKE THAT, it would help immensely if folks would provide reviews for it. A bomb hooked to a banker’s back, a one-eyed busted-out former cop, hooker/biker bars on Airline Highway in New Orleans, drugs in the French Quarter, a 300-pound female bartender, an ex-con whose main goal in life is to have more expensive shoes than anyone else, a drug czar named Fidel Castro (a cousin of the more famous one in Cuba), money laundering schemes, and a criminal genius, who enjoys pulling his victim’s fingernails out with pliers and who did everything right in what should have been the perfect crime save for one tiny mistake—all assembled and put into motion by an author who was a real-life criminal and ex-con and was advised that if he didn’t publish this book but instead used it to create the perfect crime he’d make a lot more… This is what you get (and more) in Les Edgerton’s The Perfect Crime.  Hi folks,I talked to my publishers of my forthcoming literary noir novel, THE RAPIST, about having a contest here for folks to vote on the four possible covers for that novel. Here’s what Eddie Vega, one of my two editors/publishers (along with Cort McMeel) had to say when I broached the idea to him.Les,Yes, by all means. You can actually put it up for a vote and chances are the final results will be consistent with the final selection. Why? Because the final cover will be use elements from all of the covers. So everyone wins. I am very partial to the image of No. 3, the lettering of No. 4 (but without the fingerprints), the placement of the author’s name at the top of the page used by No. 1 (though I would move the BKP logo to the left hand corner so it would not compete with the illustration).In your blog, please do point out that we used the earlier suggestions made by your followers: the floating body, the light, and the turned hands. So they will know we do more than hear, we listen. Please, also include a call to “like” Noir Nation on Facebook. Prague is almost done the layout. We are less than two weeks away from glory.Eddie VegaThey really do pay attention to what you guys have to say. Eddie really liked the suggestions you made awhile back when I posted the initial mockup of this cover.What I’m going to do is if anyone makes a suggestion that they use on the final cover, we’ll send them a free copy when it comes out.For those who may feel off-put by the title, please rest assured it’s probably not what you think. My wife Mary resisted reading it for a long, long time, thinking it was some gruesome and graphic account of a rape, but when she finally did read it, she told me she absolutely got drawn into the world completely and she said it was like “the protagonist (Truman Pinter) had entered her own mind and revealed her deepest thoughts better than anything she’d ever read.” To tell the truth, I was shocked and extremely pleased that she “got it.” I shouldn’t have been surprised—Mary’s very intelligent. The rape in it is fairly akin to the mother's death in Camus' The Stranger--it serves the same purpose. This book is the best thing I’ve ever written and I don’t think I’ll ever have the energy again that it took to write. Cort McMeel and Eddie Vega both feel it’s going to be a game-changer in literature. We’ll see…Anyway, here are the four versions of the final cover and the end result will probably be at least a bit different than any of these, especially after Eddie reviews comments from y’all. The covers are all from the Prague firm of Butterflies and Hurricanes, who’ve been working on it for months. Bare Knuckles Press has spent a significant amount of time, money and other resources to come up with a distinctive, one-of-a-kind cover. I know I’m impressed!In order, from top to bottom, they're numbers 1-4. Thanks for taking a look and providing comments!Blue skies,Les"},
{"title": "ANOTHER CARL BRUSH REVIEW OF AN ANTHONY NEIL SMITH NOVEL", "date": "Wednesday, August 17, 2011", "text": "Hi folks,Here's another Carl Brush review of Anthony Neil Smith's novel, HOGDOGGIN'. Jeez! Carl's like me. Once he gloms onto a writer, he can't rest until he reads everything the author has written! I'm the same way. In the last two weeks I've started reading John Gilstrap and went through everything he has out. Did the same with Smith, Joe R. Lansdaler and Chris Ewan. All in the last couple of weeks. This is truly the real GOLDEN AGE OF LITERATURE. I don't think there's ever been a time in history where there are so many great novels out there. I'm like a pig fell into a vat of sour cream--just flat-out gorging myself. Next up I want to read Linwood Barclay's new novel, then Harlan Coben's, then... so many! so little time! so cool to be living now!Here's Carl's review. Sucks he compares HOGDOGGIN' to Shakespeare. He never compared ME to Shakespeare...writer workingcarl r brushHOME \rWriting \rBLOG--REVIEWS AND ESSAYS \r    As I stated in my piece on Anthony Neil Smith’s Yellow Medicine, the main goose that prodded me to download that book and Hogdoggin’ was Les Edgerton’s suggestion that they might give some notions re how to handle backstory in my The Second Vendetta--Recently  finished and on the agent/publisher market, owing significantly to  messrs Smith and Edgerton. If it ever comes time to compose that  acknowledgements page, you’ll both appear. Like Les, I also promise to  show up on your doorstep with beer and bourbon and, also like Les, I  remind you that I write fiction.    But about Hogdoggin’ itself. We left Billy Lafitte at the end of Yellow Medicine    beat and lost but apparently not in danger of immediate arrest or death  from the federal or local local law or from meth dealers or terrorists.  When we last see him, he’s about to make a phone call, but we  we never  see him pick up or hear a conversation. Twisting in the literary wind,  is where we’re left.     We find him up in Hogdoggin’  months later as the chief enforcer of a brutal motorcycle gang. You  have to hand it to Smith. He’s not afraid to go over the top. The gang’s  leader is a huge guy named Steel God. You can guess what he’s called  for short. The little society is elemental and tribal. The king is old  and sick, the natives are restless, and rebellion is brewing-- a  movement to topple the ruler and raise a new one. Billy’s role is to  protect the head guy as well as (some believe) to take his place should  the rebellion succeed. A tangled web for Billy, who’s more of a direct  action kind of guy not naturally built for political nuance.    Then comes the phone call. Trouble  involving the wife and two kids he’s left behind in New Orleans. Turns  out Franklin Rome, the chief nemesis FBI agent from Yellow Medicine  hasn’t been obeying federal orders to keep away from Billy. Rome hasn’t  bothered the Minnesota case which got him in such hot water in the  first place. Instead, he’s been trying to dig up old bones re Billy’s  Gulf Port/Katrina days, and he’s been using Billy’s ex and kids to do  it. Rome figures to not only extract incriminating info, but flush Billy  out of hiding where he and Lafitte can go mano-a-mano and settle the  blood feud that still churns through Rome’s gut and mind 24-7.    The agent’s ploy works, though in  ways and with consequences he never imagines. And we’re in for some  surprises, too. One of the premises of noir appears to be that  everyone’s a shit in at least one way or another, and that the shit will  come out under stress. Another is, that no one gets what they’re  looking for at least in the way they were expecting. Smith puts those  principles in relief by giving virtually every significant character in  the book his/her 5-15 pages of fame--at least one POV chapter. And he  pulls it off the parade without interrupting the flow of the story or  disturbing the fictive dream. You start to get to know, even like,  someone, then they’re dead. C’est la dirty ol’ noir vie. Well done.  Keeps the reader--at least this one--locomotivating through the book.    But, you ask, or should, what about Billy? He’s much the same reckless, passionate lord of misrule he was in Yellow Medicine,  but the ante here is up even higher. He’s got dark forces pursuing him  from all sides and in ways even more dangerous. Count ‘em--1) The legit  FBI; 2) the rogue FBI (Rome and a crew of misfits he’s gathered); 3) a  pair of sheriff/FBI wannabes; 4) armed country huffers out on a spree;  5) Not to mention God and his girl. 6) and a mystery character you’ll  absolutely love.I probably left out someone. Was ever anybody in more  trouble than this?    They tell you to put your  protagonist into so much trouble even you don’t know how he’s going to  get out of it. Smith does that. Question is, does he get him out of it?  Take a look at the end, then tell me whether Billy survives. Maybe we  should tweet the author some votes. There are some vague clues, but I  hesitate to make too much out of them.     One more thing. I opined at the end of my Yellow Medicine commentary that Franklin Rome was going to get his comeuppance in Hogdoggin’, Well, it’s clear he gets a comeuppance,  but in what form? Again, you tell me. It might be a hint that the author’s next book, Choke On your Lies, appears  not to feature Billy, at least in the /Amazon peek I took. don’t know  if Smith has a commitment problem--that’s between him and his therapist  and his significant others--but he loves leaving his readers on the edge  of our seats. Like Shakespeare at the end of Measure for Measure--now there’s a classical reference to give noir some respectability. You’re welcome.Hogdoggin'C.P.

{"title": "GUEST POST - CARL BRUSH", "date": "Monday, August 15, 2011", "text": "Hi folks,A treat today--two reviews by my friend Carl Brush. One on my new novel, JUST LIKE THAT, and another on YELLOW MEDICINE, a brilliant noir novel by Anthony Neil Smith. Carl doesn't normally read noir, but I'd recommended YELLOW MEDICINE to him as a great example of another writer's techniques in writing flashbacks. Here's Carl's take on both:WRITER WORKINGCARL R BRUSHwww.writerworking.netTAKE YOUR YELLOW MEDICINEALONG WITH YOUR YELLOW SNOWIf you ever wondered what noir fiction was, you’ll find the definitionin Anthony Neil Smith’s e-/paperback-book, Yellow Medicine. Start with the protagonist. Deputy sheriff Billy Lafitte is not just flawed. He’s a doofus. Impulsive. Doesn’t think ahead. When he’s intent on bonking someone, he usually fails to check behind him to see if someone else is about to bonk him. All this costs people injury, money, even lives. Still, you root for him. Why, I’m not sure. Maybe because always trying somehow to do the right thing even though he goes about it in every possible wrong--legal or illegal--way imaginable. The action centers around some terrorists who are moving in on the meth trade in rural Minnesota. Lafitte considers both the geography and the drug traffic his territory. He’s got paid informants inside the labs, tries to keep things under control even if he roams outside of what’s strictly legal to do so. He’s had the same kind of history in his previous law enforcement gig on Gulf Coast. He crossed a few too many lines during Katrina, taking payoffs from the rich and delivering them to the poor. Even blowing away a gangbanger in the process. All this costs him wife, kids, job. He gets a second chance via a brother-in-law sheriff in Minnesota and he ‘s doing his best to make the best of it. Trouble is, his best isn’t so hot.Instead of teaming up with colleagues to take the terrorists out (He doesn’t know they’re Al Quaeda at first.) He tries to take care of everything in his characteristically improvisational and lame-brained manner. Add to this the fact that he has a penchant for jumping the bones of every female he can--whether they’re witnesses or criminals or whatever--and you have a bundle of dangerous messes. Add to that a vengeful FBI guy who is convinced that Billy is not just a bungler but a terrorist himself, and you have witch’s brew. There’s so much violence and blood--beheadings, burnings, dismemberments (by the terrorists as well as by Billy)—and grotesque sex that “noir” doesn’t begin to describe how dark the talegets. Not quite a horror story, but close.I’m not sure I can say I liked Yellow Medicine, but I was fascinated throughout. And Smith’s flashback techniques are masterful, which is one of the main reasons Les Edgerton recommended it to me and that aspect paid off because I used some of them them as a model in my rewrite of my The Second Vendetta (I’ll let you know when you can look for it on Kindle, etc.) Not only that, I just started reading the Yellow Medicine sequel--Hotdoggin’. Poor Billy Lafitte. But this time, I have a feeling that vengeful FBI guy is going to get his, and it’s going to be oh, so ugly.And then, Carl's take on my novel:              writer workingcarl r brush    Since  Les Edgerton is not only a mentor but a friend of mine, let there be no  pretense of objectivity here. Writer Working regulars know that I  usually link up to a bio the first time I mention a writer’s name in one  of these commentaries. Here, though, you have to read the book. That’s  the bio that matters. Just Like That is, he says, more than 80% autobiographical, though he gives only a peek at what is and isn’t fiction in the intro.    What is real is a look into the criminal world.  Not just a peep show, either.   Just Like that  opens with a couple of ex-cons on a road trip.  they travel from  Indiana to Louisiana in a picaresque adventure, flexing their freedom,  fighting and stealing as they go. Nothing serious, just to get along.  Here’s where we start to understand a little of what goes on between the  ears of outlaws. Actually, we begin to realize that we don’t understand  at all. We get a brief look, like at a passing train. We don’t  understand because they don’t either, and they don’t spend much time  reflecting about it. Early on, Jake goes into a convenience store for  the same reason everyone else does--pick up a few supplies. A couple of  fairly insignificant things happen, and he suddenly adjourns to his car,  where he grabs his pistol, walks back in, robs the place. Even  threatens to blow a little boy’s kneecap if he doesn’t obey his mother.  Why? He doesn’t know. He could use the cash, sure, but there’s not much  of that. He has no plan about before, after, or during. Just does it.     I’m reminded of the character Richie Nix in Elmore Leonard’s Killshot (see  Writer working, July 25) who shoots and robs on impulse. Something rang  true to me about Richie. Les’s Jake, drawn from his own experience,  seems to confirm that truth. Most of these crimes are the product of  unplanned, indiscriminate action. Look for plot, planning, goals, you’re  looking for something you won’t find.    Just Like That  doesn’t stay on the road, though. It migrates to the most unpicaresque  environment imaginable--the penitentiary. Jake has recidivist buds  there, and they engage in a number of survivalist actions that, unlike  most of their actions “on the bricks [outside], do take some planning  and plotting. Enthralling reading. Lean and mean, unscented and  unflowered prose.    The characters--especially Jake--do engage in some reflection here. He even reads and rereads Moby Dick. He  delivers a couple very instructive rants about how much you can trust  the veracity of Hollywood’s version of prison life (Hint: Not at all.)  [There are a couple of puzzling repetitions of these. Bad editing?  Making sure the reader gets the point? Dunno.]Jakes musings also include lots of contemplation of relationships--hetero-, homo-, undefinable-sexual.   Two of the points I hadn’t thought about--a big reason for the dearth of true inside info--MSNBC’s wall-to-wall Lockup included--about  prisons are, first, so many hard-core inmates are semi-literate that  they couldn’t write true accounts if they wanted to. Which they don’t.  Second, they’re never going to tell a camera or a reporter what they  tell their colleagues. They’ll proclaim their innocence to the ends of  the earth if you ask them. If their cellmate asks them? Fuckin’ A I did  it, and a lot more. and it was fun.     And so is Just Like That fun.  And scary. To be able to run around the world with that kind of  abandon. Even us regular citizens love the idea. If we had the guts. Or  the idiocy. Or whatever it takes. Just Like That does have what it takes.     Kindle book. Amazon. Don’t have a Kindle? You can download it to your PC or Mac. Les will tell you how on his Lesedgertononwriting  blog. And/or  he’ll personally instruct you at your house. And bring  the beer. Of course, as he reminds us, he does write fiction. Writer Working signing off. You’re on your own.

{"title": "SANDRA RUTTAN REVIEWED", "date": "Sunday, July 31, 2011", "text": "ReviewSUSPICIOUS CIRCUMSTANCESBySANDRA RUTTANThis is the second of Sandra Ruttan’s novels I’ve read—the first being Lullaby for the Nameless--and I’m firmly hooked. It took two novels to determine the effect of Ruttan’s work on me—I’d compare the process to first discovering jazz and through both a gradual immersion in the music itself and learning how and why the emotion is influenced by the technical elements, Miles Davis becomes an artist in the listener’s mind. The same thing happened here. I wasn’t born appreciating Miles Davis, but in time I became one of his biggest fans. The same thing is happening here with me and Ruttan.After reading Lullaby for the Nameless, I wanted to write a review, but I wasn’t ready. Her work—at least for me—can’t be approached and dissected like most novels—there’s a complexity in her work that takes time to understand (at least for me). When I tried to marshal my thought processes to pen an opinion, I kept coming up with the same, vaguely incoherent impressions. I felt like I was channeling my inner Harold Bloom. The overall impression when I finished Lullaby was that this was a work that had the feel of the Impressionists—you know, daubs of paint that once applied, the artist never touched it again or blended it. Little islands of words that somehow made a picture. The other overriding impression was that her writing was Jungian in conception—Jung’s “nightdreams” (not nightmares, although they could be) as opposed to the daydream of most novels. The Jungian approach to writing is of a higher order than the more language-based approach of the day dream.Carl Jung believed that language imposed a barrier to the true understanding of the individual, because language consists of symbols and those symbols are a layer between the person and anyone trying to communicate with that person. The intellectuals and psychologists will probably shudder at my feeble layman’s understanding of his theories, but they’re all I have to operate with so I hope I’ll be forgiven for any liberties with his teachings here.My understanding is that Jung felt that because of the artificial nature of words and language as symbols, that a truer understanding of a person’s psyche lay in coming to an understanding of that person’s dreams at night where those symbols aren’t present. For dreams are the manifestation of the true mind of the person without the barrier language poses. Examples in literature are novels such as John Hawkes’ The Lime Twig, which literary types are perhaps loathe to term a crime novel, but indeed, it is.The daydream, is the more usual of novel constructions. The protagonist’s motives and goals are usually based on a simple emotion, most commonly revenge for something that happened in the past. A common example is the plot where the skinny kid goes to the beach to see a girl he’s hot for, bullies see him and depant him or otherwise humiliate him; he goes home and purchases a Charles Atlas course or learns kung fu, goes back and kicks the bully’s asses, wins the babe. Perfect for Hollywood. Perfect for a light summer read at the beach.I realize I’m attributing things to Ruttan’s novel that may be overboard, but I’m just trying to describe my impressions as best I can. I think the reasons I felt this way were twofold. One, while her character’s dialog was pitch-perfect, the lack of tags many times confused me as to who was saying what until I backtracked. Second, many of the space breaks were “lost” when the text moved to the top or the bottom of the page, and I’d turn the page and was suddenly cast into a different pov or time period without the benefit of a signal to inform me that was what had happened. A number of these incidents led to an overall sense of being a step behind the plot much of the time. Finally, I decided to just read on and not worry about who said what or where we were in the chronology. And, I’m glad I did. Like the Jungian shrink listening to the patient on his couch, the more I read, the clearer it became. It also became clear that this was a writer writing intelligently; for intelligent readers. A writer with more of a European writer’s and reader’s sensibility, where the reader’s ability to “get it” is perhaps more of a given than for American writers. A writer who out-minimalizes Ray Carver.I began to come to that awareness of Ruttan’s work with Lullaby; it was fully realized with Suspicious Circumstances. I just had to learn how to read her. Just the same as I had to learn to appreciate jazz.I won’t give you the plot points and all that of either novel. Others have done a better job at providing that information in their reviews. What I offer for your consideration is my opinion that any reader who enjoys encountering an intelligent author between the pages will appreciate Sandra Ruttan. She’s the sort of writer that one wishes one could spend a lazy afternoon in a bar talking with. It will be an interesting and educational experience.One thing more. I coach a few writers on their novels, and one of my clients is a terrific writer named Maegan Beaumont. Last week, Meagan emailed me about a concern she had with the novel she’s currently writing. Here’s what she asked:Hi Les,I have a question, hopefully you can help me out...In my romance development between Sabrina and Michael I'm caught in the age-old dilemma... sex scene or no sex scene. I kinda feel like it's like the torcher scene between the killer and Lucy. I went half-way and it was okay but when I finally \"went there\" it really challenged me as a writer and really set the tone for the whole book. I have a feeling that this is same thing. I'm not squeamish about writing that sort of stuff but I really want to stay away from that \"heaving bosom\" and \"throbbing member\" crap... really not my thing. So a few suggestions... your humble opinion... a stern directive would be greatly appreciated :)Also... I had always planned a romance between S&M (so glad you agree!) but I tried the sappy sweet \"happily ever after\" and it just didn't work for me. What I'm thinking is that they fall in love but can't be together because of the device in his back and he's forced back into service for FSS. It really plays with the second novel I'm planning and maybe by that time I can work through my happy-ending phobia. Let me know what you think... and thanks :)MaeganTo which I answered:Hi Maegan,Short answer is you don't have to have one of those sweaty sex scenes at all. You don't even have to have a sex scene at all. If you want one, fine, if you don't, that's fine also. And, if you do, you can create it any way you feel comfortable with and in the best way you feel it serves the story. Myself (and I'm like lots of readers, I think), whenever I encounter them, usually I just skip over 'em. Most are boring. It's virtually impossible to write a truly original or creative one any longer. Just don't feel you have to have one to \"sell\" your book. Not true at all. They're not obligatory in the least.Hope that helps!LesI followed that email up with this one:Hi Maegan,Here's something you might want to look at to see how a successful author writes a terrific novel where all through it there are obvious fireworks between two characters and never once do they do the nasty and yet it works as a powerful romance without them sweating and moaning in some Lady Chatterly sex scene. Check out Sandra Ruttan's Suspicious Circumstances. Seeing how this wonderful writer opted to answer for herself your very question and not include what some feel to be that obligatory sex scene will be illuminating, I think.Blue skies,LesOne of my litmus tests as to whether I feel a book is original and represents excellent writing is if I can use it in informing my writing students and clients. Only the best books reach that threshold. Ruttan’s does just that.Hope this helps and hope you’ll check out Sandra Ruttan.

{"title": "CHEAP HAIRCUTS - A Rant", "date": "Monday, July 25, 2011", "text": "Hi folks,This post is about as far from a writing topic as one can get, but in a way it’s related—it stems from an article I read today in the Ft. Hooterville Journal-Gazette. The instant I read it, a red mist rose up in my vision, blinding me. It was a wire article from United Features Syndicate titled SIMPLE SOLUTIONS and subtitled: GET A CHEAPER HAIRCUT.That got my attention since I was a haircutter for over thirty years.Here’s the first paragraph—the one that induced me to throw something and break a window.“Believe it or not, the best way to cut costs is to have the hairdresser come to you. Salons pocket about 60 percent of the overall fee, so to bring in extra cash, many stylists make house calls. Just ask. Generally, the same services are available, including color treatments, but the prices are up 30 percent to 40 percent lower, because the stylist keeps all the money.”I can’t begin to tell you how wrong all of that is. Well, I can begin and will…First of all, let me declare the writer of this article a total ditz. Just another “reporter” who doesn’t do five minutes of any real research before he or she begins shooting her mouth off. In these days of political correctness, we’re not supposed to use the term “retard,” but if ever a person deserved to be described thusly, this person did. This is clearly a person who rode the short bus to school and lost her bus privileges for losing her helmet. And, became a feature writer… This is why brothers and sisters shouldn’t mate…First, I wonder if this “writer” understands why salon owners “pocket” 60 percent of the service fee. This is information I suspect escapes those who simply show up to work with the only investment being their lunch bucket. I especially love her term of “pocketing” the money. Kind of a verb that suggests a pimp taking his cut from his prostitutes.Here’s why owners “pocket” 60 percent. It’s called “expenses and overhead.” Along with “return on investment.” A partial list of those expenses and overhead would be: rent or lease payments, advertising costs, training costs for stylists, paying half of the employee’s Social Security (which brings up another expense for owners—as self-employed workers themselves, they pay both sides of SS for their own earnings), utilities, insurances (including liability policies for damages a stylist in their employ might create on a client and be sued for), benefits for their stylists, including pensions, health and life insurances, sick days, paid vacations, bonuses and a thousand other expenses I don’t recall at the moment. Not to mention furnishing a place to work, in many cases, tools, along with supplies such as shampoos, conditioners, color and perm products, dryers, chairs, refreshments for workers and clients, magazine subscriptions, the décor… it goes on and on and on. At sixty percent of the employees’ earnings, a well-run and efficient salon will realize about five percent of that. The majority of salon owners actually lose money. I know a great many salon owners who employ say five or six stylists who don’t make anything from their employees at all, and their “profit” consists primarily of what they personally take in each month.Not to mention, the salon owner took a risk and invested in the business. A risk the employee doesn’t make at all. All he or she has to do is show up for work and bathe regularly. And, most stylists aren’t getting rich, either.How do you suppose a salon owner would view one of their stylists giving “kitchen cuts” outside of the salon? A stylist who the owner has invested training dollars on. A stylist upon which the owner has spent large sums advertising for? Or paid the rent or lease money for the space she uses? Or paid half of her S.S.? Or taken out her taxes each week and paid for the accounting services to do that and provide her an annual W-2 form? Might it be possible that the owner has invested a sizable amount of money in that stylist, and might take a bit of umbrage that the client who came through the door and sat in that stylist’s chair mostly as a result of what the owner had done to induce her to come to the salon? If so, what do you suppose that owner feels about such a stylist going to that client’s house to do a kitchen cut and pocketing the entire, discounted fee?Not very kindly.In fact, when I owned salons and employed stylists, if I caught any of my employees doing that, they’d be automatically fired. On the spot. No appeal. It’s unethical, it’s immoral, and it’s a crime. It’s called STEALING from the employer.And, yet… this is what this moron is suggesting people do.Should we do the same for other services? Should we ask cab drivers to take us someplace “off the meter” for a cheaper fee? To conveniently “forget” the owner who has paid for the cab, paid for the insurance, the phone bills, the building they worked out of, the utilities paid, the business they worked for years to establish the reputation of his or her fleet? In this writer’s mind, it looks like that would be just fine.Or, should we find a clinic and search out the junior doctors and nurses and offer them a lesser fee to come to our house to perform their ministrations? Find a just-graduated dentist to visit us in our homes to treat a cavity? Find a newly-minted lawyer in a large firm to write our wills for us in our house?I doubt if she even considered that, but what’s the difference? Is it because she doesn’t see a stylist as being as “professional” or “important” as other service vendors? Her attitude fairly well screams what she thinks of hairstylists. Second-class citizens.I think I’ll offer my services as a writer for her column. At forty percent of what she receives. That would be a great deal for United Features, as I think I can offer demonstrable proof that I’m a better writer than he or she is…She offers some other ways to beat the price in salons. I’m so pissed at this person’s attitude I don’t want to spend any more time on her ignorance. I just wish I was still cutting hair and I knew who he or she was and that they popped up in my chair. I’ve got a cut in mind for them that would be worth every cent of the 40 percent she was paying…This is the mindset of (many—not all) people who work for corporations or the government or other institutions and not small businesses. They really don’t have a clue how this thing called “the economy” works.Their ignorance is appalling.I’m still mad.It’s one of the reasons I’m not cutting hair any longer. People like this writer.If anybody knows the name of the person who wrote this article, send him or her to me. I’ve got a home haircut just for him or her…Final thought—are there any editors out there any more who actually think about the copy that’s turned in? Any editors at the newspapers who buy this garbage who actually think about what they’re printing? That have a clue why newspapers are dying?Rant over... For here. I'm still fuming. Blue skies,Les"},
{"title": "SNEAK PREVIEW--BOOK COVERS FOR JUST LIKE THAT AND THE PERFECT CRIME", "date": "Saturday, July 23, 2011", "text": "Hi folks,Just got the probable covers for my two novels about to be published by StoneGate Publishing and thought I'd share them with you.JUST LIKE THATThis is a road novel, based on my own experiences in and out of prison. I'd estimate it's about 80 percent true life stuff. Several excerpts from this novel have been published as short stories in such magazines as Murdaland, Flatmancrooked, High Plains Literary Review, Houghton-Mifflin's Best American Mysteries 2001, and two excerpts will be published in the forthcoming Noir Nation. A couple of the excerpt/stories have been nominated for a Pushcart Prize.The cover: The second cover is for my novel THE PERFECT CRIME. This novel was previously sold in auction to Random House and then the deal fell apart when Bertlesmann bought R.H. as previously chronicled on this blog. I'm deliriously happy that Aaron Patterson is bringing it out now with StoneGate. When I wrote this, one of my good friends, Bob Parker, had done projects for the government for various agencies and he vetted it and proclaimed it, indeed, \"the perfect crime.\" He told me I should either do the crime myself or publish it and that I'd probably make more money if I did the crime. We'll see... He also said that it was a template for a perfect crime and that I should leave out or change at least one element so that criminals couldn't follow it, but I decided not to. And, since I wrote it back in 1995, there have been a couple of attempts to perform this crime (no one had at the time I thought up the idea), but they've all been caught. I think it's because the book wasn't out as if it was and they'd read it, they might have avoided capture... Now, law enforcement is up to speed and even if it was adhered to, they'd probably end up in the gray walls motel.The cover:They'll both be available soon from all the various outlets, including Amazon and through StoneGate Publishing. I'll be sure and let you know when.Hope you like 'em.Blue skies,Les"},

{"title": "EBOOKS AS CHRISTMAS OR BIRTHDAY GIFTS--Your thoughts?", "date": "Saturday, July 16, 2011", "text": "Hi folks,Just making some observations about ebooks and wondering how others think about this.First, I’m a believer in ebooks. Big-time. I was old-school until about a year ago when I bought a Kindle. Now, I get nearly all my books on Kindle and even pass up buying books that don’t offer an ebook version. It’s changed my reading life. And, I buy way more books now that I don’t have to run to the bookstore or wait for them in the mail. I used to buy an average of four books a week and now I’m buying closer to seven books a week. Truth.I even bought my wife Mary a Kindle and her reading habits have mirrored mine. We both love our Kindles! And, we’re both buying a lot more books than we ever have and we’ve always bought lots and lots of books. In fact, for over twenty years, as a family we visited a local bookstore every single weekend and we always bought lots of books.Since we both got our Kindles, we’ve only gone to the bookstore a couple of times. One was solely because the local Borders closed their doors and we went to get in on the close-out sales. But, our tradition of going every single week is over.And, I’ve got my next five novels coming out as ebooks. So, I’m solidly in the ebooks corner.However, I was thinking about a weakness in the ebook market and wondered what others thought about this.The weak spot in the ebook market I see is the Christmas and birthday or other gift market. It’s much more attractive to send a physical book to the person you’re gifting, plain and simple. It just feels like you’re giving a  bona fide gift when you can wrap it up and put a bow on it. Giving an ebook just doesn’t give me that kind of satisfaction. Plus, it’s really hard to send an ebook to a child in particular, because most of the kids in my family just don’t have Kindles or Nooks.I’m sure that will change somewhat over the coming years, but I don’t think there’s going to be a mass exodus for parents to buy their kids their own Kindles. At least not in my family. I suspect that will be the case in the majority of other families as well. I’m aware that there are people with more disposable income than I enjoy and that there are those who were buying their kids cell phones years before the parents in my circle did, and those folks will perhaps purchase Kindles for their kids, but I suspect that’s not going to be a sizable market, at least for awhile. At least not on my block. As one kid answered his father the other day when he asked the little guy if he thought money grew on trees, retorting, \"Not in our back yard.\"I have no way of knowing this and am basing my assessment solely on my own experience, but I also think I’m probably typical. I suspect that last Christmas season, physical books sold far more than ebooks and I also suspect that will remain the case this year and for at least the foreseeable future. When I send my grandson Logan a book as a gift (which is my usual choice of gifts for him), I can’t even consider an ebook. It has to be a physical book. One, I want him to have the experience of opening up a present. That still trumps—experience-wise—clicking on an on-switch, even if he had a Kindle, which he doesn’t. That’s just an aesthetic that I don’t see Kindle overcoming, at least for now. In the future, perhaps.What about you folks? Do you buy books for gifts and if you do, do you buy ebooks or physical books? Myself, even though I could send a gift certificate for an ebook, I probably won’t. At least for the kids I send presents to. I want to at least visualize them ripping open a brightly-colored package and getting their little sweaty mitts on a real object. Not a piece of paper that has the emotional value of getting a Burger Doodle Gift Certificate. I just can’t see them waving a slip of paper in the air, jumping up and down, and screaming, “Look what Grandpa sent me!” I can see that with a book…Also, in years past, whenever I did a booksigning, there were lots of folks who bought more than one copy of the book I was signing and asked me to sign the extra copies for their friends or relatives. Not going to happen with ebooks. The vast majority of ebook buyers buy one copy. Which really makes the sales pitch  I've always made at those signings to \"Buy 10 copies! Christmas is just around the corner!\" pretty much invalid. I'd often say that in signings held in January. And, it worked. No mas... Actually, not as many signings either... I'll miss that!I’m all for ebooks, but I see this as a market I think they’ll find difficult to make a lot of headway in, at least for now.Thoughts?Blue skies,Les"},
{"title": "DRUNK ON THE MOON  by Paul D. Brazill", "date": "Friday, July 8, 2011", "text": "Hi folks,I never make two posts in a day, but I've just finished two remarkable books--the Allan Guthrie novel just before this (check it out following this post if you haven't already), and Paul D. Brazill's great new novella, DRUNK ON THE MOON.Here's the review I posted on Amazon and Goodreads and some other places.Yowza. I just bought Paul D. Brazill’s newest offering, DRUNK ON THE MOON, a couple of hours ago and read it all the way through, my mouth agape on every single page.There are writers one reads for plot, for story, for strong characterization, for brilliant description, for brilliant dialog, for… all kinds of things. I read Mr. Brazill for all of those and more, but the thing I always look for in his work and am always amply rewarded is his writing. To wit, the way he turns a phrase, creates original-diginal language and so much “gooder” than any other writer I know. He’s the only writer I know who makes his work hard to read on a Kindle. Why? Because on just about every page I keep dropping it when I can’t help myself and clap my hands in delight.Here’s just a few of the gems that are sprinkled liberally on almost every single page:Nausea curdles away inside you.…the migraine bright bathroom…The oil slick of night…Detective Ivan Walker flew in out of the storm like a murder of crows…Suddenly, a sickly stew of screams and howls clung to the wind and drifted down to my car.The moonlight oozed across The City’s dank cobblestones like quicksilver…Days bled into weeks, which hemorrhaged into months, until the winter crept up and smothered the whiskey coloured autumn days with darkness.Outside, a sharp sliver of moon garroted the coal black sky.The winter moon hung fat and gibbous…Dark dreams lapped at the shore of my sleep until I awoke drowning in sweat.On the stage, partially clad young women slid around like spaghetti on an alcoholic’s plate.He rolled the ‘r’ in grim like it was a chainsaw starting up.I mean—who writes like that! Nobody. Nobody but Paul D. Brazill. As a writer, whenever I read one of his stories I feel like the pig who fell into a vat of sour cream. Brazill isn’t just a writer; he’s a poet and you can take any of his stories and write a master’s thesis on just the language employed.As Emily Dickenson said about the very best of writing: It takes the top of my head off.If you’re a writer, read Brazill at your peril. He’ll make you want to take your typewriter and go home and learn plumbing.If you’re just a reader who loves brilliant writing, go right ahead. Be prepared to keep yelling out to your roommate, “Hey! You’ve got to read this!”Over and over…Get this one! Blue skies,LesHi folks, I want to talk about a book and a writer I recently discovered who's the \"real deal,\" Allan Guthrie.Recently, Brian Lindenmuth, my editor at Snubnose Press, made a comment about one of my novels, The Bitch, which was a wonderful compliment to it. He said, “I thoroughly enjoyed it and I appreciated that it was a dark novel that ended darkly. So many novels are dark in the telling but pull back at the end, leaving me to shake my head.”Normally, I wouldn’t insert myself or my own work into the review of another’s work—that smacks of crude and blatant self-promotion--but Brian’s quote so perfectly fit my assessment of Allan Guthrie’s novel, Two-Way Split, I wanted to give him credit and then trust that the reader of this review and Mr. Guthrie himself, wouldn’t take offense at doing so.Like Brian, I am so often disappointed when reaching the end of a noir or crime fiction when the work takes a major turn and ends with a “Hollywood happy-sappy” finale. You know, where the mass intellect is satisfied that the person they’re rooting for throughout the book didn’t end up in jail or get killed or maimed or something terrible. I always recall what screenwriter Callie Khouri went through with her brilliant screenplay of Thelma & Louise, when the “suits” at the studio wanted to let the two women live at the end—perhaps go off to prison for a few years and then emerge as happy campers. Thank god, Khouri resisted all of that silly nonsense and had Thelma and Louise plunge to their deaths off the Grand Canyon!And, here we get another writer who doesn’t bow down to the knucklehead mouth-breathers who prefer such sappy endings! You know those folks. They’re the ones who keep that political correctness bullshit going and whose spiritual forebears were responsible in earlier ages for changing the Cinderella story where the evil stepsisters originally cut off their toes to fit the slipper into the insipid and soulless version kiddies are subjected to today. Those folks who don’t like to see much truth in their fiction… Or in their own lives…Two-Way Split starts out dark, gets even darker, and ends in almost total blackness. Superb! A novel for intelligent readers. Halleluiah! Sharon Sheehe Stark, a brilliant writer who led one of my workshops during one of my MFA residencies at Vermont College put forth to us her very original and against-the-common-herd-mentality of fiction teachers, when she dismissed the prevailing writing theory of creating characters, who promoted the technique of “having your bad guy like kittens,” as a sort of trick to get the reader to like him or her.Sharon gave contrarian advice. “Paint your character as dark as you possibly can. Don’t make him ‘love kittens’ or any of that crapola. Create a real person who hates cats as much as he hates everything else. Do not fall temptation to giving him any of those ‘saving graces.’ If you do that (and here is her genius), then the light will shine through the cracks.” (Italics mine.)This is precisely what Guthrie does in his novel. He gives us characters who act honestly, according to their view of life, as flawed as that view may be to those who prefer their characters to end up in AA or forgiving those who trespassed against them. Ain’t happenin’ in Two-Way Split.And, best of all, this is a novel that is enormously entertaining. The words such as “riveting” and the phrases such as “couldn’t put it down,” or “this was a page-turner,” are overused in assessments like this—many times, undeservedly--but dang it, all of those and more apply to this novel. I couldn’t put it down; it was riveting; it was decidedly a page-turner… and I’ve become a huge, huge fan of Guthrie. This is going to cost me some bucks, as now that I’ve read Two-Way Split, I have to buy the rest of his novels… and he has a few!I’ll leave it to others to deliver plot points and all that. I just want to get out the message that this is a powerful book and one you’ll thank me for recommending to you. One thing I will mention is the title. It’s one of the great titles in literature. It works on several levels which I won’t reveal. You’ll just have to read it to find that out.One note about the ending. As you can guess, this isn’t one of those “happy-sappy Hollywood endings.” It is, quite so, one of the best endings I’ve ever read. A good ending represents both a win and a loss. In Thelma & Louise, for example, the “loss” is fairly clear. They die. The win takes a bit more thought, but it’s also clear. The two women achieve their independence from men. Two-Way Split also has a profound win and a profound loss. You’ll have to read it to see. I promise you it’ll be worth it.I teach creative writing. You can bet I’ll be using this novel in my classes. I’m already using it to inform my own writing.Blue skies,LesP.S. Allan Guthrie is a writer, editor and literary agent who lives and creates fantastic fiction  in Scotland. I think he wears a kilt and plays bagpipes, but that isn’t confirmed and may just be a stereotype spread by vicious rumors… You can check out Allan Guthrie on his blog and website at http://criminal-e.blogspot.com/ and http://www.allanguthrie.co.uk/"},
{"title": "ELMORE LEONARD AND KILLSHOT AND JUSTIFIED", "date": "Wednesday, July 6, 2011", "text": "Hi folks,I’m a huge Elmore Leonard fan and have been for four decades. I’ve read every single thing he’s written and paying attention to his writing has been a big influence on my own.Awhile back, I wrote a couple of posts here where I discussed the television show Justified, based on the Raylan Givens character he’d created, when it first came out. At the time I wrote the post, I hadn’t yet seen the series, but had just seen the promos and instantly knew it was based on Leonard’s work, just from the sixty seconds of the promo. It had that “Elmore Leonard” feel that was instantly visible.I was excited as in my opinion, Hollywood had never gotten Leonard right. Especially in movies like Get Shorty and most of the movies they’d based on his novels and short stories over the past twenty years. They always… what’s the word?... Hollywoodized his fiction. Tinseltown, in my opinion, had never “gotten” the real Elmore Leonard.Then, when I saw a couple of episodes of Justified, I posted a review in which I expressed disappointment in the series. The main source of my disappointment was in the casting. Timothy Olyphant as the lead character just seemed too soft. That’s how I described him in my negative review, and it wasn’t exactly the right word, but I just couldn’t put my finger on exactly what was wrong with him as Raylan Givens.Now, I know what the right word is.First, I need to give some backstory to show how I came to the conclusion that once again, Hollywood had failed to grasp Elmore Leonard.My favorite of all of his novels—hands-down—is Killshot. I’ve read this masterpiece over twenty times. I feel it’s the very best of all his novels, bar none, and that’s going some. He’s written an awful lot of masterpieces! But, Killshot is, word-for-word, one of the best novels ever written by anyone. Again, in my opinion, but it’s the only opinion I have to work with.His opening in that novel is the single best opening in any work I’ve ever read, and, as many of you know, openings are my particular shtick, and I talk about it extensively in Hooked. It does so many things. It creates the particular tone that is only Leonard’s and plunges the reader into the world of that novel completely and absolutely. It’s intelligent—written with Leonard’s minimalism that shows a complete trust in the reader’s intelligence to be able to understand it without the author using a teleprompter. I’ve read the novel at least twenty times—I’ve read the first few pages probably a hundred times. It’s that good.In my review of Justified, I mentioned Killshot, as I’d read somewhere that they were making a movie of it. I vowed then that if they messed that film up, I’d never again watch a Hollywood version of a Leonard novel.Well—shame on me—I don’t read the entertainment pages or People Magazine or any publication that talks about movies, so I didn’t realize it until a month ago that the movie Killshot had come out. A couple of years ago! And, I’d missed it!I ran to the local Blockbuster’s and rented a copy. Viewed it two days ago. Viewed it yesterday. Viewed it a few minutes ago. Later on, I’m going to return to Blockbuster’s and buy it.This is the first movie they’ve ever gotten Leonard right. It was pitch-perfect. Before I saw this movie, I had two favorite movies. As many of you know, I think Thelma & Louise is the best-written movie of all time. At least for fiction writer’s purposes. My favorite movie for all reasons—script, acting, entertainment value—all of the elements of great film—is The Hustler. For lots of reasons. One is that when that movie came out that’s what I was doing—hustling—and my friends immediately nicknamed me “Fast Eddie.” I was in the Navy at the time, and when I left those shipmates, the nickname slipped into disuse among my new friends. But, The Hustler was loaded with everything I want to see in a movie. Powerful acting performances by Piper Laurie and Paul Newman (Paul Newman, in my opinion, is the best actor who ever lived and I do not want to get emails telling me Marlon Brando or Johnny Depp or somebody else has that title, as I’ll delete them unread…). If you don’t believe Paul Newman is the best actor who ever lived, rent The Hustler and The Color of Money and compare the performances of both Newman and Tom Cruise in the respective title roles. Both are about the same age when they made each movie, and when you watch them together it’s clear that this is a comparison between a man and a boy. Or, an actor and a model…I digress…I learned that the reason I didn’t know it had come out was that it came out direct-to-video instead of as a theater release. This just shows two things. The intelligence of the multiplex audience and the intelligence of Hollywood… The review posted on IMDb mostly panned it. http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0443559/  Which… shows the intelligence of the reviewer as well…Or, perhaps, since everybody else didn’t like it except for me, it may be my I.Q. that is suspect… I've been told that once or twice... Of course, the ones who criticized me and were foolish enough to provide their addresses are now room temperature... (Thanks, Guido, and you know what I mean...)The movie Killshot was just that. Killer. For the first time ever, I got to watch a film based on a Leonard novel in which every single person involved in making it understood and “got” Elmore Leonard. I’m not sure who the casting director was, since listed on IMDb were four names—Kerry Barden, Billy Hopkins, Diane Kerbel and Suzanne Smith—so I don’t know who cast which parts, but whoever was responsible for which roles, they all did a superb job. Mickey Rourke as The Blackbird was the perfect choice. Every time Rourke makes a movie, I’m the first to buy a ticket. And, this was the best role he’s played since Angel Heart (which, coincidentally, is the only movie set in New Orleans that got the Big Sleazy right…). His sidekick, the smarmy Richie Nix, was played brilliantly by Joseph Gordon-Levitt. I was afraid they’d be unimaginative and go for somebody like Steve Buscemi, but intelligence ruled in this choice. It isn't that Buscemi wouldn't have played the part well, but his fame would have overpowered the performance. This role called for a relative unknown. The Wayne Colson and Carmen Colson roles were filled by Thomas Jane and Diane Lane, and whoever made the decision to cast these two understood the novel completely. The “stars” were Blackbird and Nix, and not the husband and wife. Actually, the casting choices for the husband and wife were pitch perfect as they didn’t steal scenes or interest from the true central characters of the story. This is The Blackbird's story, all the way.Hossein Amini, the screenwriter, did such a great job of getting the story down as Leonard wrote it that I was surprised that Leonard himself hadn’t written it. He completely understood the particular genius that is Leonard. Every single note was spot-on.As did the director, John Madden. In fact, every blessed person involved in this collaborative effort just nailed Leonard perfectly. They were all on the same page. Which may be why it wasn’t released in theaters and why it got a shitty review. I suspect most movie-goers who don’t read Leonard would have preferred Quentin Tarantino and Danny DeVito to play some of these roles and made it into a comedy with clever dialog.However, the thing that really made this movie true to Leonard more than anything, was Rourke’s performance. I’m glad that he played this part at his age now than in his younger days. I think if he would have had this role a few years ago, he would have overplayed it, much as did Robert DeNiro in the remake of Cape Fear, with his over-the-top performance where he came across mostly cartoonish with his overacting. Kind of a Jason role without the hockey mask. This kind of thing plays well for the pubescent crowd at the multiplex, but does little for acting subtlety and true acting chops. What makes Leonard such a great writer is not only his dialog (which was everywhere in this film!), but his approach to his characters and the world they exist in, in that they’re amoral to the nth degree. Totally existential landscapes and characters. Rourke played the role with true understated genius, and, by not trying to create a “bogeyman” kind of character, delivered a truly scary guy. He never once gets in his own way by stooping into melodrama. He’s a force in this movie, just as Leonard created him on the page, and he’s so powerful because nothing can stop this guy—certainly nothing moral. He plays the true criminal mind and character better than anything I’ve seen or read in a long, long time. And, I know something about the criminal mind...And, that’s the key to my reasoning why Justified doesn’t work for me. It’s because Raylan Givens is the kind of character Leonard is almost alone in creating. His characters aren’t concerned about right or wrong, good or bad. They’re just concerned in… doing their jobs, getting through life. Doesn’t matter which side they’re on—the so-called “good” side or the so-called “bad” side. All of the characters in a classic Leonard story are almost totally amoral. In other words: realistic. In other words: pure noir. That’s the Raylan Givens character in the printed story. Not what appears in the series.But the creators of the TV series didn’t understand that about Leonard’s stories. They made the stories and the characters moral. Compare the Olyphant character in the series to the Thomas Jane role in Killshot. Wayne Colson could give a shit about anything moral in the popular sense at all. He just wants his wife back and for The Blackbird to go away and leave them alone. While Olyphant looks soft and gooey in a white Stetson, Colson looks “real” and much better without one. A great example to illustrate that most audiences like at least a bit of a sermonette in their entertainment. Hollywood's idea of a lead character is to make him or her moral... but with a flaw. Bullshit Writing 101.And that’s why Hollywood always fucks up Leonard stories. They know the average popcorn buyer isn’t into noir nor do they understand or appreciate it. That’s why they always try to broaden the audience by turning great stories into… shit. People understand crap. Many don’t really understand art.I know I’m that prophet crying alone in the wilderness. I know that Hollywood will probably never adapt a “true” Leonard story. But, they did once and that’s great. If you love noir, rent this movie. If you like Quentin Tarantino and Danny DeVito in your crime roles, don’t.This one’s for you, Carl Brush! I’ll be very curious if you agree or disagree with me on my take here.I’d really be interested to know if Elmore Leonard agreed with me on any of this. Probably not. At least I suspect he wouldn’t agree publicly—but I wonder if he would in private. I know if I was him, I’d be kind of pissed about what Hollywood does with his stories…Hope you folks found this halfway interesting.Blue skies,Les"},

{"title": "PAUL D. BRAZILL REVIEW OF MONDAY'S MEAL", "date": "Saturday, July 2, 2011", "text": "Hi folks,Normally, I wouldn’t do what I’m doing here—post a review of one of my books, but I’m going to sneak in an exception to that today.I woke up this morning in a great deal of pain. I sprained my back last week and haven’t had a single night where I get more than a couple hours of sleep I’ve been eating pain pills like they were popcorn, but nothing seems to help. Doc said it would be 6-8 weeks before it healed. The first thing I did when I got up (after I yelped like a weenie getting out of bed) was what I always do—turn on the ‘puter.And there was an email from my Goodreads account and in it was a review from Paul D. Brazill on my short story collection, Monday’s Meal. All the pain vanished.I hadn’t expected Paul to write a review on it. I’d sent him a copy awhile back just as a small gift in appreciation because he’s been huge in helping boost my writing career. He’s just one of the most generous writers in the business at helping his fellow writers.The thing is, Paul D. Brazill is one of those names with very serious“weight” among the writing fraternity. To have him praise my work is like Job hearing from God saying, “Attaboy!”Rachelle Gardner, a well-known agent, recently posed the question on her blog, “Money or readers:What’s more important?” Well, both are important, of course, but to me I’d rather have the words of someone like Paul than any number of readers or any amount of money. Money’s nice, but it eventually goes, and readers are great, but there are some godawful writers out there who have gobs of readers. But, when a writer of the stature of one such as Paul D. Brazill praises your work, that is beyond lucre or numbers of readers. I know lots of writers who would disagree with that, but that is my feeling.I’ve had three events in my writing life that I count as more valuable than anything. The first was when I was a young writer whose manuscript had been chosen for a small workshop by Tim O’Brien (with one of the stories in M.M.) and he pulled me aside to go outside and talk with him. He told me that my writing reminded him of Raymond Carver and that my style was the same as Carver’s. He later sent me a long letter saying basically the same thing. At the time he said that, I didn’t have a clue who Raymond Carver was. To be honest, at the time I didn’t know who Tim O’Brien was! I’m mostly a self-educated writer (this was before I attended Vermont College for my MFA), and I kind of knew O’Brien was a big deal, although I hadn’t read his work at the time, but I had never heard of Carver. After the workshop, I went home and purchased one of Carver’s collections and instantly I felt a kinship with the famed writer. It was like shooting the shit with a homeboy in the joint—we spoke the same language. He quickly became my favorite writer and not because Tim had compared me to him or that he was a big deal in writing, but because his writing was so damned good and you really don’t “read” Carver… you just fall into the world of the story.The second seminal event in my writing life was when the NY Times reviewed Monday’s Meal (Denise Gess), and compared my writing to Ray Carver and also praised my dialog, which I’ve always felt was my strength. I got tons of great reviews on M.M. but this was… the TIMES! Not the Mayberry Gazette or the Hog Digest or Ft. Wayne Journal-Gazette, but the TIMES!And this is the third.I couldn’t tell you how many sales I’ve enjoyed for my books—some have been great and others not-so-great, and I can’t tell you how many readers have bought copies… but I can remember almost word-for-word every one of these three things.And that’s why I wanted to share Paul’s review with you.*From GOODREADS:Paul Brazill gave 5 of 5 stars to:Monday's Meal by Leslie EdgertonMonday's Meal: Storiesby Leslie Edgertonread in June, 2011            LES EDGERTONWho makes the best beer in the world? Maybe the Czech or Belgians. Definitely not the Danes. Or the Americans.But when it comes to short stories, well, the Americans rule the roost, they really do. Flannery O’ Connor, Raymond Carver, Stephen King, Dorothy Parker, Charles Bukowski, Richard Ford, Kyle Minor. Loads and loads more.And you can add Les Edgerton to that list.Monday’s Meal by Leslie H Edgerton was published in 1997 and contains twenty-one tales of dirt realism. Sharp slices of American life. They’re set in New Orleans and Texas. Sometimes in bars or behind bars. They’re about café owners, hairdressers, nightclub musicians, prisoners, ex-cons, drifters and drinkers.Monday’s Meal opens and closes ‘Blue Skies’ and ‘Monday’s Meal, tales of strained relationships.’ But the real meat is sandwiched between them. And Monday's Meal is particularly meaty.Some favourites: ‘The Mockingbird Café’ is the story of a man in a low-rent bar trying to mind his own business; ‘Hard Times’ is bleak and scary and brilliantly written; ‘The Last Fan’ is a tragic look at a shattered marriage; ‘My Idea Of A Nice Thing’ is a touching and sad story of an alcoholic’s crumbling life;’Telemarketing,’ is the story of a young couple just trying to get by; ‘I Shoulda Seen a Credit Arranger,’ is a Runyonesque crime story.And there’s plenty more to enjoy in Monday’s Meal. Edgerton has a strong and sure grasp of the lives of people who are standing on the edge of a precipice.And Les Edgerton will soon have a new short story collection published by the hip new kids on the block, Snubnose Press, which can’t be bad!*One of the stories Paul singles out, “Hard Times,” is one I wrote when I was 12. At the time I didn’t know what a litmag was nor did I have a clue how one got published. Another one in the collection I wrote a few months later when I turned 13 (“Broken Seashells”). When I was in college I finally found out you could send stuff out and how to do so, so I sent it to The Analecta and they published it. Not a word was changed from the original (which was handwritten—when I was 12 I didn’t yet know how to type). When it was included in the collection, my editor, Charlotte Wright, suggested my original title—“A Mother’s Love”—was too sappy (agreed! I blame my tender age at the time for that title) and so I changed it to “Hard Times.”Thank you, Paul. I will always treasure your words.And, folks, I know this is tooting my own horn…. but this is PAUL D. BRAZILL! I just wanted to share my utter delight with you.Blue skies,LesP.S. I contacted the director of the University of North Texas Press (the publisher of M.M.) inquiring about securing the rights to Monday’s Meal to republish it as an ebook, hopefully with Aaron Patterson’s StoneGate Ink, and he told me there were still about 100 copies left and he wouldn’t release my rights to do so until they were all sold. If that happens, expect a call from me, Aaron…"},
{"title": "NOIR NATION ABOUT TO LAUNCH", "date": "Friday, July 1, 2011", "text": "Hi folks,The inaugural issue of NOIR NATION is about ready to launch! This is one of the most exciting developments taking place in literature. I’m extremely proud to have a story included. A couple of my writing buddies have stories in it as well—Paul D. Brazill and J.J. Toner. These stories come from all over the world—for instance, Paul lives in Poland and James in Dublin. And, as most of you know, I live in the international, cosmopolitan city of Fort Hooterville…The chief editor is Eddie Vega in Brooklyn, and the other editors are Cort McMeel in Denver and Alan Ward Thomas in P:rague.Click on the link and see their trailer. It kicks butt!  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwzLuUWQi5oHere’s what the folks of NOIR NATION have to say about themselves:'Noir Nation aims to create a journal of crime fiction supported by an interactive community-building Web site. The Web site will also feature short original works of film noir.We decided to pursue a digital platform because there are many places in the world with roads that are difficult to travel, which lead sometimes to poorly stocked bookstores and libraries.Noir Nation: International Journal of Crime Fiction would be delivered electronically anywhere in the world that can receive either cable or wireless communications signals.The magazine will be professionally edited and designed so that readers can engage immediately with the writing and art and the ideas they convey rather than having to overcome natty typos and badly formatted paragraphs that slow the velocity of their enjoyment.Why crime noir? There is currently no periodic publication on an international scale satisfying readers' hunger for works of well-wrought literary fiction that explore the dark side of human experience, and that does so while pursuing its own aesthetic ends, rather than the legitimate but sometimes competing interests of the marketing departments of commercial publishing houses.To accomplish our goals, we will rely on local and internationally based writers and visual artists and graphic designers to create, edit, and lay out the magazine in a format that will be delivered to e-book reading devices, including the Kindle, the iPad, and smartphones. This venture will be supported by a Web site that will invite bloggers and other writers to share information and commentary about developments in the noir and crime writing community. A keen eye and a good rapport with readers and artists will ensure that Noir Nation will have a steady supply of the best crime fiction being written today'.I took the above from Paul D. Brazill’s blog at http://pdbrazill.blogspot.com/ Writers of, and lovers of, noir and crime fiction should visit their Facebook page at https://www.facebook.com/noirnation?sk=infoI’ll let you know the instant the first edition becomes available. Trust me—this will be a magazine you'll want to get your hands on! These are the same folks who have founded the new press, BARE KNUCKLES PRESS, who are publishing my novella, THE RAPIST. I’ll have a future post about that soon.Blue skies,Les"},
{"title": "GUMBO YA-YA TAKEN BY SNUBNOSE PRESS", "date": "Wednesday, June 29, 2011", "text": "Hi folks,Well, this is turning into a banner year! Two days ago, I received an offer from Snubnose Press to publish my new short story collection, titled GUMBO YA-YA. This makes the fifth book placed this year. I'm starting to get dizzy...Snubnose Press is the new ebook press founded by the prestigious Spinetingler Magazine http://www.spinetinglermag.com/  and it’s a distinct and singular honor to be published by them. I was alerted to them by two of my heroes, Paul D. Brazill, one of the top noir writers in the world, and by Jack Getze, Fiction Editor of Spinetingler and author of the Austin Carr series. I met Jack a couple of years ago when we were both appearing at the Writer’s Retreat Workshop in Kentucky and became instant buddies. Turns out we both share a love of good writing—in particular, crime fiction—and Mr. Jack Daniels. I was introduced to Paul by Robin Billings, a terrific writer in her own right. The moment I first read his work, his particular genius was evident and I became a huge fan. If you haven’t yet read either of these guys, I’d recommend you glom onto their work. You can check each out on their blogs—Jack at http://austincarrscrimediary.blogspot.com/ and Paul at http://pdbrazill.blogspot.com/. Tell ‘em I sentcha!Jack gave me a heads-up on Mr. Lindenmuth’s tastes, saying, “He goes for very edgy, nourish stuff. No happy endings, you know?” Do I know?! Jack just described my twin from whom I was separated at birth! He described my own tastes perfectly and I started feeling good about my chances with him. None of my stories will ever be considered by the Disney folks. Reminds me of something my wife Mary said recently. She said, “Okay. How am I going to recommend my husband’s books to my friends? They’re titled THE BITCH and THE RAPIST!” I answered by saying, “I understand. How about if I change them to ‘The Hardy Boys Visit the Playground Slide' and ‘The Sugar Creek Gang Catches Flies’.” She felt if I did so it would make it somewhat easier for her to recommend them…I do understand Mary’s concerns. I encourage her to voice her feelings. After all, she only fell in love with me because of that Stockholm Syndrome thingy and we’re trying to work past all that business and ancient history…It pays to network. However, while knowing prominent people in the business is extremely helpful, it still all comes down to the work. No matter who you might know, if the writing isn’t top quality, your work will get rejected the same as anyone else’s who doesn’t measure up. Thankfully, Brian Lindenmuth, the editor of Snubnose Press and nonfiction editor and awards director at Spinetingler Magazine saw GUMBO YA-YA as a quality work. Brian’s wife, Sandra Ruttan, was the co-founder of Spinetingler Magazine, along with her former husband and along with Jack Getze. Check out Sandra’s books on the website—if you like dark crime, she’s your writer!I always try to practice due diligence and research any press before I submit. Before I queried Brian, I purchased and read their first published book, Speedloader, a collection of six stories by six different writers. An awesome collection! Not a weak story in the lot! Simply a gathering of six extremely good writers. As soon as I read this collection, I knew this was a press I wanted to be published by.As of this writing, the collection consists of 14 stories and two essays. I’ll be adding one more story to it as Cort McMeel and Eddie Vega, publishers of NOIR NATION are reading five of my unpublished stories to pick one for the inaugural issue, and as soon as that’s determined, that story will be added. It could easily end up with fewer stories, as my experience with collections is that the editor will most likely delete a story or two from the final version if he feels it might not be as strong as the others. Or, maybe not. I’m glad I don’t have to make that decision as I like all of them—they’re my babies!I love writing and reading short stories. Collections, as a rule, don’t make publishers or their authors rich. But, I have reason to believe we may do well on this one. My other collection, Monday’s Meal, has sold all but about 100 copies of its print run, and garnered rave reviews, including this one from The New York Times:The New York Times Book ReviewThe sad wives, passive or violent husbands, parolees, alcoholics and other failures in Leslie H. Edgerton's short-story collection are pretty miserable people. And yet misery does have its uses. Raymond Carver elevated the mournful complaints of the disenfranchised in his work, and Edgerton makes an admirable attempt to do the same. He brings to this task an unerring ear for dialogue and a sure-handed sense of place (particularly New Orleans, where many of the stories are set). Edgerton has affection for even his most despicable characters—\"boring\" Robert, who pours scalding water over his sleeping wife in \"The Last Fan\"; Jake, the musician responsible for his own daughter's death in \"The Jazz Player\"; and Tommy in 'I Shoulda Seen a Credit Arranger,\" whose plan to get hold of some money involves severing the arm of a rich socialite—but he never takes the reader past the brink of horrible fascination into a deeper understanding. In the best story, \"My Idea of a Nice Thing,\" a woman named Raye tells us why she drinks: \"My job. I'm a hairdresser. See, you take on all of these other people's personalities and troubles and things, 10 or 12 of 'em a day, and when the end of the day comes, you don't know who you are anymore. It takes three drinks just to sort yourself out again.\" Here Edgerton grants both the reader and Raye the grace of irony, and without his authorial intrusion, we find ourselves caring about her predicament.—Denise Gess. The New York Times Book Review, November 16, 1997Monday’s Meal also earned a starred review from The Library Journal, along with great reviews from “Studies in Short Fiction,” The School Library Journal, The Port Arthur (TX) News, Texas Monthly and blurbs from such writers as Dr. Francois Camoin, Diane Lefer, Vince Zandri, Melody Henion Stevenson, Carol Anshaw, and Gladys Swan. It was also a Finalist for the Violet Crown Book Award.And, I think this collection is even better. It ought to be—hopefully, I’ve become a better writer since that book came out!What’s really cool about Snubnose Press is that because of Spinetingler Magazine’s outstanding reputation as a publisher of top-notch fiction, their books are going to be treated by reviewers, bestselling lists, and awards organizations the same as print books. That’s a huge advantage over many ebook publishers.This marks the fifth book either my agent Chip MacGregor or I have placed this year—it’s without doubt my best year as a writer! Kind of makes up for the lean timesHope you find this interesting! And, those who’ve known me for awhile know I’ve had some really, REALLY lean years, so I hope this gives my fellow writers who are undergoing dark times now hope for their own futures. As that great Canadian philosopher, Red Green says: “Keep your stick on the ice. We’re all in this together. I’m pulling for ya!”Exactly.Blue skies,LesHow I came up with the title \"GUMBO YA-YA\"  is a story in itself. Story collections are supposed to fit into a theme. When my first collection, MONDAY'S MEAL was taken by the University of North Texas Press, the tales in it didn't fit much of a theme. They were kind of all over the place--kind of like me about whom folks say I'm like \"a fart in a skillet.\" While this collection is a bit more focused, theme-wise (all dark), they still cover lots of areas. I came up with \"Monday's Meal\" as a southern institution that fit the body of work. In the Deep South where I grew up (Texas and Louisiana), Monday was traditionally wash day. That meant the wife not only had to take care of her kids and husband and do the regular chores, she also had to do the weekly wash. There wasn't much time to make a meal, so the traditional meal became gumbo or a stew--something the woman could stick on the stove and, when she had a spare minute or so, run in and throw in an ingredient as it simmered all day. There were a lot of ingredients, that, at first glance, didn't seem to go together, but when it was finished and served her hungry brood, turned out delicious. I grew up in a bar and restaurant in East Texas that my grandmother owned, and she had one wood stove in the kitchen that was reserved strictly for gumbo. Nowadays, restaurants serve gumbo by particular names, i.e., \"shrimp gumbo,\" or \"chicken gumbo,\" or \"crab gumbo,\" or whatever. Oldtimers just made... gumbo. It could have any number of ingredients and usually did. (The one ingredient that almost always was in it was okra, and of course, to begin with, \"first you make a roue.\") For instance, in season, one of the best ingredients would be crab eggs. They're delicious and have a wonderful texture and flavor! She would simmer the pot all day long and when she got a minute, throw something into it. We just called it \"gumbo ya-ya\" as every day there was a different mixture. Again, often including ingredients that you might not think would go together, when you tasted it, it was wonderful. Ergo... the title GUMBO YA-YA. My hope is that when you read the gumbo assembled in my collection, you'll think it's delicious as well..."},
{"title": "NEW NOVEL - JUST LIKE THAT", "date": "Saturday, June 25, 2011", "text": "Hi folks,As I promised at the end of the last post, I want to talk about another new novel forthcoming from StoneGate Ink (http://www.stonegateink.com/)  later this summer, titled JUST LIKE THAT.Quite a bit of this novel has already seen publication as parts of it have appeared as short stories in various publications, including Murdaland, Flatmancrooked, Kansas Quarterly/Arkansas Review, High Plains Literary Review, Houghton-Mifflin’s Best American Mystery Stories 2001, and one forthcoming in Noir Nation. A couple of the stories taken from this novel were nominated for the Pushcart Prize. So, I feel it has already kind of proved it's worth a bit.It’s largely autobiographical—perhaps 80-85% taken from my own life. It’s centered around a road trip that I actually took with a friend from the joint.Awhile after I was released on parole, I was working in a barbershop in Lakeville, Indiana for a guy named Dean. His shop was cleverly named “Dean’s Barbershop.” Dean was a truly cool guy and I loved working for him. At the time, I was charging $1.00 a haircut; at the end of my journey as a stylist, I was charging $100 per cut.Every single morning when I arrived at work, Dean always said the same thing over our morning coffee before we opened the doors. “Les,” he’d say, a faraway look in his eyes. “Do you ever think when driving to work that someday you’d just like to keep going until you run out of gas, and then, wherever that is, you get a job there and live there?” I admitted I had the same thought many times myself. After all, until I was about 40, I’d never lived in one place more than two years at a time. Some places I’d lived in more than once, but never more than a two-year stretch at a time. I loved moving to new places and even today, after two years in one place I find myself incredibly bored with wherever I am. Although… I’ve been stuck here in Fort Hooterville for many years… (I’m still bored and more than ever!)Anyway, Dean never followed his own dream, but one day, I did just that. Was on my way to work and hadn’t even thought about it when I woke up that morning, but halfway to Dean’s it struck me that, yeah; I’d like to keep driving until I ran out of gas.So… I did just that. I pulled over, got on the phone and called Bud Palmer, a friend of mine from the joint who was out also. Like many ex-cons, Bud was of the same mind as I was—that “rolling stone” mentality, and in a nanosecond, he said, “You bet. Give me half an hour and I’m with you.”An hour later, we were on our way. We would have left sooner but I had to stop to pick up some cash… at a convenience store. (Which I can talk about as the statute of limitations is past for what transpired there. Other things in the book are fiction and because of that statute of limitations thing…)Where to, neither of us had a clue. I just wanted to go somewhere warm and interesting, and to me, that meant South.We ended up in Lake Charles, Louisiana after some adventures along the way in Kentucky and New Orleans. Bud ended up climbing on a Trailways and going back home to his girlfriend and I stayed awhile longer, and eventually I came back to Indiana also.I could never understand what the big deal about leaving a place and moving to another. At least in those days, you couldn’t move anywhere in the U.S. where you weren’t $100 from home, wherever home was. That was the most Greyhound charged for a one-way ticket to anywhere in the country. That means that if the worst thing happened—you couldn’t get a job, ran out of money, whatever—you were only a hundred bucks away from getting to where you had a support system and friends or family. And, no matter how broke a person might be, when push comes to shove, you can always come up with a hundred bucks.To make this work as a novel, I had to take some liberties with the time line. Actually, I took two trips (with a different buddy) and have kind of combined them into one. One trip was a bike trip where another friend and I decided to take off on our bikes and go to Mexico. We never made it, but some of the things we did and experienced on that trip are included in JUST LIKE THAT. One thing I left out, is that at the time (of the bike trip) I had hair down to my waist and a long ZZ Top kind of beard (this was before ZZ, or at least before I was aware of them.). We arrived at the Grand Canyon and there were these little places where you could pull your vehicle off the road and gaze down into the Canyon, and we were pulled off, toking on a joint and drinking some brewskies, when four RVs pulled over and all these “popcorners”* started piling out of their campers with their cameras and taking pictures. Only… they weren’t taking pictures of the Grand Canyon. They were taking pictures of us! That’s when I first shaved my head and cut off my beard (long before Michael Jordan!). Just too much… tourists taking my picture over shots of the Grand Canyon...*”Popcorners” is a term an old girlfriend of mine gave to retirees. One time, we were at an American Legion drinking and they were having a dance with one of those big balls swirling overhead and we looked in at the dance, and she said the dancers looked like “popcorn popping” with their white hair bobbing up and down. Ergo… “popcorners.”A lot of this novel takes place in the joint at Pendleton and is based on experiences I had there. I think readers will get a kick out of these parts. Most books written about the joint have most of it wrong. The reason is most folks who find themselves in prison are barely literate and not likely to write a book about their experiences. At least not the ones who find themselves in state joints. In federal joints, it’s a bit different, as they house white collar criminals, but then many federal joints aren’t anything like state joints. If I ever think I’m going to end up in a state joint again, I’m pulling a federal crime and ‘fessing up  to that so that I go to Prison Med instead of Michigan City! There’s really no comparison.I had one of my advisors (Diane Lefer) at Vermont College when I was getting my MFA who asked what I thought about a famous author (whom I won’t name) who writes a lot of his fiction about criminals and the joint. I told her that while I enjoyed his fiction, I didn’t buy a word of it. His stuff sounded like it came from a guy who’d spent a night or two in the drunk tank or maybe spent a bit of time as a reporter in a joint. There’s no way such experiences counts for anything at all. It’s like those kids who go through the “Scared Straight” programs. They may go inside the walls and they may even have inmates pretending to “break bad” on them, but it’s not even close to a real experience. These kids know they’re not going to wake up in the morning and for the next several years, having to watch their backs every second. There’s only one way to get that experience and that’s to get sentenced and actually live it.The “Scared Straight” shows are really a joke. I’ve watched a bunch of them and to begin with, the kids are always surrounded by hacks who, if an inmate actually broke bad with the kids, would have the guy in the hole and the kid hustled out immediately. It’s a stretch to think these kids actually get scared, especially since some of them have already done juvie time and may have already had somebody try to get their brown eye. And, they never have truly bad dudes participating in these deals—most look like the kind of guys who the actual bad dudes are breaking bad on. There’s no way the prison is going to let them hang out with Charlie Manson or his cellmate, Roger Smith, the “most-stabbed inmate in history.” The guys who participate in this program are trying to get out by doing this kind of “community service,” and have a boatload of good time to even qualify for the program. They’re not going to put kids in contact with the dudes who are truly bad. The kids who go through this stuff have to know this. It’s a good idea in conception, maybe, but I’d be surprised if any other than the truly naïve are much influenced by the experience.Anyway, in JUST LIKE THAT, the reader will get a bit truer look at the joint than they will in most books… There’s a scene where Jake (the protagonist) and Bud are in a swamp in Louisiana and just shooting the shit about fears that shows the criminal mind fairly accurately. Cathy Johns, then the assistant warden at the Louisiana prison at Angola (the Farm) read this and wrote me that it was \"the truest account of the criminal mind\" that she'd ever read. Should be. I was a criminal for a long time.Hope when it comes out you’ll glom onto a copy and if you do, I hope you enjoy it. We don’t have an exact date just yet, but anticipate it’ll be available as an ebook in August. I’ll post it here as soon as it is.Here’s an excerpt:From JUST LIKE THAT--            “Let me call my old lady,” Bud said, not even asking where I was--which was the QuickStop, or where I was going--which I didn’t know, or why or none of the kind of questions a straight john would of. Just, “Let me call Kimmie. She’s working down at Parkview Hospital in housekeeping. Give me an hour to pack.”            To kill the time, I invested in a call to my brother. “Thirty-five cents,” the operator said. “For three minutes.”            “Shit,” I said. “I just want to use this for a minute, lady,  not buy it,” but I was talking to a ring tone. Bitch.            “Hello,” I said. “Is Raymond there?” It was my sister-in-law, Ruthy Ann. I figured it was a Tuesday, Ray might’ve had a hangover and skipped work. I had his work number if I needed it, but it turned out I’d called the right number first.            “--fuck you calling this early for?” he said. “I’m still in bed.”            “Yes,” I said.            A woman with a little blond boy, about four maybe, pushed by me to get to the cooler where the pop was and I had to hug the wall to let them by. He was crying he wanted a Coke-Cola and she was saying it was too early for pop; he should have a fruit juice, how about orange or maybe cranberry? The cranberry was on sale, she was explaining to this little brat; I could get two, one for you and one for me, honey. I waited till they were past to resume my own conversation.            “Jake? You still there? You calling from jail?”            Raymond calmed down when it became clear I wasn’t after bail money, was offering him something instead.            “I got a bunch of clothes, two nice leather jackets, both full-length, and other stuff, records. There’s about an eighth in a bag in one of the pockets of the brown one.”            “And I can have it all?” he said, waiting for the catch. “You owe rent or something doncha? Will the landlord let me in? You still in that place in Ft.  Wayne off Lake?”            I laughed. “Yeah, and I’m paid up for two more weeks, Ray. I’ll call him, tell him to let you in. I’ll even see if he’ll give you the two weeks I already paid. I doubt it though. There’s some deposit money too, but I think he’s gonna want that to fix the door.”            “Well say, it’s worth a try,” he said. “Maybe I’ll just use it for two weeks. Have some poker parties.” I could see his mind working, figuring out how to capitalize on his sudden good fortune only I figured it wasn’t poker he had in mind. I wondered if Ruthy Ann was standing there listening and did he think she was that dumb. He was going to drive all the way down from South Bend to Fort Wayne for poker parties? Sure. “Where you going Jake? You told Mom? What’d she say?”            “No,” I said to the second question, and “I don’t know, Ray. I can’t say for sure,” to the first.            “Hey, Jake.”            “What?”            “How come you weren’t at Dad’s funeral?”            “I was.”            “Fuck you were. I didn’t see you. You wearing your Captain Midnight Invisible Shield?”            “Maybe. Fuck you, Ray. I was there. Don’t worry about it. I just didn’t go in the church is all. I paid my respects in private.”            “Yeah.”            “Yeah.”            When I hung up, the kid’s mother had gone to the front by the cigarettes and Slim Jims and the kid was opening and slamming shut the cooler door. I guess she’d given up on him. Me, I’da left him. Climbed in my car when he wasn’t looking and went out and took in a movie, hope he got run over by a beer truck, something.            “Kid,” I said, crooking my finger at him and bending over. “Kid, you get the cranberry juice like your momma told you. I got a gun in here and if you don’t I’m going to shoot you in the leg.” He stood there a minute and I was half out the door when he came screaming up to his mom. I looked back in the car and seen her and she had the little shit up in her arms glaring at me. So were some other people. Fuck’m, is what I thought. I was in a mood.            I started to pull out then changed my mind. One of those things that were always happening, don’t ask me why. I went back in.            “Line up by the coolers,” I said, waving my hog. “Fill it,” I said to the clerk, this kid who was a poster for the pimple cure industry, shoving one of the plastic bags on the counter at him.            While the clerk was putting the money in the bag, I told the little kid’s mother, “Honey, you go back and get you a can of that cranberry juice.” The smart thing would have been to get the hell out of there, but I wasn’t done.            “Drink it,” I told the kid. He only started bawling. “Drink it or I’m gonna blow out your kneecap, you little shithead.” His mama seen I was serious, slapped the living shit out of her kid, held the can for him while he tried to choke some down, both of them boohooing. It mostly got all over the front of his shirt way he was moving around, looked like blood.            “You mind your mama, son,” I said, going out the door. “Less you want to end up like me.”            I headed over to Bud’s place. On the way I dumped out the bag on the seat and tried to count it with my free hand. No more than fifty-sixty bucks it looked like, mostly ones and a few five’s. One lousy ten.Blue skies,Les"},
{"title": "NEW NOVEL - THE PERFECT CRIME", "date": "Tuesday, June 21, 2011", "text": "Hi folks,Sorry I haven’t posted in a bit, but I have four new novels coming out this year and have been knee-deep in rewrites! I’ve also been covered up with the last (hope!) revision of my memoir, ADRENALINE JUNKIE, prior to sending it to my agent to begin marketing it. I had to do one last rewrite on it as, at the “young” age of 68 and as chronicled here, I found out the man I had always been told was my father… wasn’t. That kind of put an entirely new twist on my life so I figured I needed to address that.Anyway, I wanted to talk a bit about the four new novels coming out and today I’ll focus on the first, a crime thriller titled THE PERFECT CRIME.This one has a history. I wrote it back in the nineties and at the time my agent, Jimmy Vines, was arguably the hottest guy in agenting. If you’ve ever seen the movie, Jerry Maguire, the title character played by Tom Cruise was Jimmy to a T. A slick-talking (in machine-gun bursts), expensively-dressed, stereotypical polished New Yorker smart-ass type, Jimmy could easily have been the originator of the phrase, “Show me the money.” Lots of publishers did just that for his writers.Jimmy received so much initial excitement from publishers when he first sent out feelers on THE PERFECT CRIME that he decided that even though this was a first novel, this was a book that needed to go to auction. For those writers here who’ve had a book go to auction, you know that’s one of the biggest thrills for a writer to be had, up there almost with getting a nomination for the National Book Award, or a travel agent calling to check on your drink preferences for your flight to Stockholm, or, even getting a message on your unlisted cell phone from Kim Khardashian giving you her private number and inviting you to a “personal and up-close” slumber party and something she called a “sesh” with her and her sisters, ending her message with a cheery, “Call me, ya big lug!”In other words, a literary auction is a big deal.It was… what’s the word?... exciting. I’m sitting here in the Great Flyover in Fort Hooterville, Indiana, and every three or four minutes, Jimmy was phoning me breathlessly from the Big Apple, giving me up-dates. Between his calls, I’m screaming at my wife Mary to “Don’t go near that phone!” and ignoring the withering looks she was shooting my way. Offers were being messengered to Jimmy every couple of minutes, and he’d be calling to tell me who’d offered what, what the bidding was up to, who’d joined the fray and who’d dropped out.Finally, everyone had dropped out except two players, Random House and St. Martin’s. Both made their final bids. Random House offered $45,000 for their advance and St. Martin’s offered $50,000.“It’s your call,” Jimmy said. “We’ll go with whoever you want.”We talked about it and I tried to weigh the offers. Both were big, well-known, respected presses. Both were talking about a probable three-book deal, a series based on the same characters, and depending on how the first book did, the advances for the next two would most likely go way up. Jimmy figured the final tally would be in the healthy six-figure range. Enough money that I would be able to achieve my version of true wealth—being able to fill the gas tank up completely each time on my car instead of the normal two buck purchase. He talked about the excellent chances he saw for a future movie deal.Finally, I made my decision.Worst decision of my life, bar none. The financial fall-out from that decision destroyed me at the time and actually, I've never recovered. More about that later...“Random House,” I told Jimmy. “Why them?” he asked. “Because,” I said. “They’re Random House.” The House of Bennett Cerf and all those legends of literature. I didn’t care it was for less money than St. Martin’s was offering. This was Random House.Jimmy understood. He called St. Martin’s, told them my decision, and the editor who had been doing the bidding, Charlie Spicer, was disappointed, but before he hung up, told Jimmy, “If Edgerton ever has another book and is looking for a publisher, we want first crack at it.” Just a pure gentleman. I just wish...Next, he contacted Scott Moyers, the senior editor who had been doing the bidding for Random House. Scott had just come over from Villard Press and been appointed a senior editor. Mine was the first book he’d signed for his new publisher.The day I signed the contract was one of the happiest of my life.I was at a crossroads in life. Up to that point, I had made a terrific living for thirty-plus years as a hairstylist. My wife Mary and I had our own salon, Bold Strokes Hair Design, and we were booked solid for six months in advance. But, our lease was up and we had to make a decision. To sign a new 5-year lease or close the salon. Up until then, even though I had sold several books, I had never considered quitting my day job. I’d heard and listened to all the advice about not doing so until one was absolutely certain he’d be able to make his entire living from writing.Now seemed the time. I’ll relate the rest by including the gist of an exchange of emails between myself and one of the most respected agents in the business a couple of years ago. I won’t name the agent as I don’t want to reveal his identity as he was honest with me about what had probably happened but didn’t want to be identified for clear reasons.Here’s is the email I sent this agent:Dear____________;I'll try to be as concise as I can be. A few years ago, when I was a client of Jimmy Vines, I wrote a crime thriller that he was ecstatic about. So ecstatic that he took it to auction, which, as you know is a rarity for a first novel. It was an exciting time—phone calls and emails every few minutes for several days—you know the drill. The upshot was that it came down to two houses, Random House and St. Martin's. St. Martin's offered $50,000 and RH offered $45,000. Jimmy said we'd go with whoever I wanted. I decided on RH because... well, it was Random House. The company that Bennett Cerf built and with all that glorious history. I was going to be a Random House author!The editor who took it was Scott Moyers who had just that week come over from Villard to become a senior editor at RH and this was the very first book he signed. They were going to bring it out simultaneously in hard and soft cover, from Ballantine and RH. Jimmy told me that Ann Godoff, who was the president at the time, personally phoned him and raved about the book, telling him how much she loved it. She said they were going to guarantee me that not only would it come out on the NY Times bestseller list; it would come out as #1 the first week. She said she could guarantee that because the lists weren't derived from sales but from copies printed, etc. She and Scott then asked that I change the title as they saw a trilogy in the future and they wanted the name to be one that would lend itself to that. The original title I had was The Perfect Crime and they asked that it be changed to Over Easy, a play on the \"Big Easy\" since it was set in New Orleans and they wanted the other two to be as well. As soon as it came out, they wanted to create a new contract for a new two-book deal. But, my God—I couldn't believe what she was telling me—that my book was going to be Number One. That's a cloud I'm probably never going to reach again. From the lips of the president of Random House, that's something you can take to the bank. Or so I thought. (I'm bad on dates, but it seems to me this was around '97.)I know this is all very interesting and all, but so far everything's going well and why am I telling you all this you're probably thinking. Well, that's when the bottom dropped out. The time period here is crucial as you'll see. A week after I took RH's offer, Bertlesmann took over Random House. Being out here in the \"great flyover\" I had no clue as to what was probably going on in NY and London, in the power centers of publishing, but it's obvious to me now that the Bertlesmann takeover is what impacted my deal.For the next several months I rewrote the book entirely for Scott four times. I'd already rewritten it twice for Jimmy before he'd sent it out and I had no problem with either guy requesting rewrites. I'm a firm believer that writing is rewriting and I do it cheerfully and professionally. At the end of the last rewrite, Scott emailed me and said he was regretfully going to have to turn it down. During the process, he had me eliminate a major character and do some other things. In his notes for the last rewrite, he said he wished I would write like Russell Banks! For the first time I got mad. I told him if he wanted Russell Banks, why didn't he just sign him? Just weird stuff. I told him I'd done everything he'd said without question as I didn't want to \"be that guy\" editors talked about--the difficult writer. To that he said, \"You should have pushed back.\" My bad, I guess...I talked to Jimmy and he was furious with Scott and RH and said he'd never ever do another deal with Random House the rest of his life—that he'd never heard of a major publisher treating someone this way, etc. At this remove, I confess I'm a bit skeptical now of what he was saying, considering I was this little guy out here in Indiana and he was claiming he'd never again deal with the biggest publisher in the business because of what they'd done to me. Lots of things I thought at the time have changed the more I think about it. I have a strong suspicion that he was... how do you say it? Blowing smoke up my ass? Yeah, that's a good way to describe what I think happened.What was the kicker was that St. Martin's had offered $5,000 more and wanted to publish it without changing as much as a comma and they wanted an additional 3-book deal after it came out. The editor who participated for them was Charlie Spicer and Jimmy told me that after they lost out in the auction, Charlie told him that \"if Edgerton ever wanted to leave RH, we'd take him in a minute.\" He said later, that if \"Edgerton wrote another novel like that that they wanted first crack at it.\"Which made what transpired next hard for me to get the logical part of my brain around. After the RH fiasco, I asked Jimmy if he could take it to St. Martin's as only a handful of people had even read it—RH and St. Martin's and maybe a dozen others who had participated early in the auction. No, Jimmy said, it's a dead issue now, but as soon as we sell your next one, then we can get it published. That never made sense to me being as no one had read the book except the ones mentioned above. It wasn't as if the public was aware of it or had read it or anything.Anyway, Scott was very apologetic and said he'd make sure I would never have to repay the part of the advance I'd already received ($12,500). Shortly after that, he left RH and I've never heard from him again. About two years later, I got a bill from RH for the 12.5 and I wrote them back, relaying what Scott had told me. Nothing happened until a couple of years after that and I got another bill and I told them the same thing and again, haven't heard from them since.This whole thing really impacted my life in ways that are still happening. At the time, my wife and I owned a very successful hairstyling business. At the exact time I signed with RH, our lease for our shop was up and we had to make a decision to sign a new 5-year lease or not. I'd always tried to be realistic and practical and even though I'd sold a number of books before the RH thing, never succumbed to the temptation of quitting my day job. Well, this seemed to be the perfect time to do so. I was given enough money to live on for the next year while I rewrote; Ann Godoff had guaranteed Jimmy (according to him anyway) my book would be #1; they wanted at least two more books after this one, etc. I felt it was time to become a truly full-time writer. So we closed the business and my wife went to work at another salon and I settled down to all that I've related above. The upshot was that after a year of all that, our business was gone and I was jobless and went through some health problems that wiped out our savings and put us heavily into debt, etc. We've never caught up since. You can't go back and regain your clients--they're gone forever, for the most part. I feel pretty sure that Bertlesmann taking over probably put all this into action—there was probably some sort of house cleaning and lots of books like mine were probably thrown overboard, and people jettisoned, etc. I have no way of knowing this—just a strong suspicion.I'm not a whiner and I don't blame the world for the bad things that happen to me—it's just part of the deal of life and usually because of bad choices I'd made on my own. The reason I wanted to share this with you is that I still have this novel and it's a good one and I'd like your opinion as to if I should send it out.Mr. ______, thank you for reading this and taking your valuable time to do so. If any of this intrigues you and you'd like a look at it, I'd be very happy to send it to you. Also, if you know Charlie Spicer and run into him you might ask him about the deal. We don't get \"do-overs\" in live as a rule, but that's one guy I wish I'd gone with. He really liked my work and in every dealing with him I always felt he was a true gentleman.Thank you so much for taking time for someone who isn't even earning any money for you.Blue skies,LesThe agent’s reply to this was:Les-You don't owe Random House squat. Having \"won\" you at auction, followed up by having you rewrite the book multiple times, what they did is completely shitty behavior. And it happens every day. I'm actually surprised they bothered to send you two bills. For Das Random Haus, $12,500 is pocket change and they probably cleared it from their books as a write-off years ago.When Rupert Murdoch's NewsCorp Inc bought a company, (name deleted), they cancelled a lot of contracts... only they found other ways of saying it so CEO Jane Friedman could be quoted in the press saying, \"We didn't cancel any contracts.\"I do business with Random House every day, and would sell them one of my represented books in a heartbeat. To booksellers and book reviewers that little house on the spine, or even better, that little Borzoi dog, still carries a lot of cachet and helps get reviews and in-store display space. The fact is, though, the Random House of Bennet Cerf, or even Bob Bernstein is long gone. They do some books brilliantly. Most others are little more than putting a cover on the barely edited manuscript and shipping it out the door. Sadly, that's true most places. The hard part for old grizzlies is that they remember what Random House used to be -- before it was a division of an arm of a media conglomerate and expected to cough up 15% quarterly profits to the Mother Ship. The old souls have either fled the building (actually \"the building\" is gone too) or sit in their offices, bitterly waiting for the day they can full advantage of a fat 401K.Ann Godoff is over at Penguin now.  She \"might\" view this as an opportunity to do right by a book and an author she once seduced with fantasies of a #1 New York Times best seller ** or she might want to slink away in embarrassment. Plus, who knows what portraits of you as a madman had to be painted by Scott or others in order for them to look less evil. I'm actually surprised Ann would do such an amateur thing. She is a total pro and I think brilliant publisher. I love the way she works between the cracks. Who could have predicted the huge best selling audience for Orchid Thief or Midnight in the Garden of Good & Evil before they were published? All those previous best sellers about Savannah or orchids? What was the obvious category for these books? They are not typical true crime or travel or anything but extremely well written. I love Ann for that.  But I would NEVER promise an author a best seller. The fates are too fickle. Why is Marley & Me a massive and ongoing seller, where Mark Doty's version of the same book (only MUCH better) a quiet success and no one reads Willie Morris' classic My Dog Skip. I'm not even sure the Morris is still in print.There is a great essay by E.B. White called Here is New York. White wrote it in 1949 and it is absolutely relevant to this day. In writing about New York City, I think he nailed the right attitude for anyone aspiring to be a writer. He wrote (and I paraphrase badly, having not read the piece for ten years), \"If you come to New York, you having to be willing to be lucky.\"If Ann Godoff is a \"No,\" maybe George Witte, the editor-in-chief of St Martin's would be intrigued by the story of the Auction they lost so many years ago, but get a chance to win now. Sally Richardson, their President & CEO, I'm sure was at St. Martin's at the time and probably read your manuscript. She's very involved. I sold one of my writers on the idea of going to St. Martin's over going to HarperCollins and a \"name\" editor in David Hirshey. My reason was because both Sally Richardson and Matthew Shear, their publisher, had called me to say how much they liked the manuscript. I told the writer that in-house enthusiasm is worth its weight in gold. The book comes out in July. We'll see how right or wrong I was.So yeah, dust off Over Easy and send it in. I am even more surprised than Ann's promised best seller that your agent would say it's a dead book and nor resubmit it to St. Martin's. This happens all the time. After David Ulin had post-Harper Morrow back away from his book, he resold it to Viking. And heck, what's gotten more press this last year than the passed around If I Did It by O.J. Simpson?Best,Mr. ______________Mr. ___________ and I ended up not hooking up, as I have other forms of work he doesn't represent, such as sports books, a YA, etc. He's a great guy, though, and very generous in sharing his advice and wisdom with me as he did with the above. I just thought it'd be easier to show you our correspondence about the PERFECT CRIME/OVER EASY book as it contains all the pertinent facts about what happened so you'd know the history.I had some other worries about this novel. When I wrote it, the idea behind the crime was truly original. Such a crime had never been committed. My worry was that some outlaw would eventually come up with the same idea and even though I had thought of it first, his effort would trump mine in the public’s eye. Well, a couple of years ago that very thing happened. And then again. The good thing is that neither were really the “perfect crime.” They’d made some mistakes—which is why they were caught. Mistakes I’d foreseen and hadn’t had my character make. So, while yes, there have been a couple of instances where the basic idea has been used, they still haven’t reached the “perfect” level mine has.Indeed, when I was writing it, I conferred regularly with Bob Parker, a good friend of mine who’s a computer genius and has done work for various government agencies. He looked it over, found a weak place and told me how to fix that and when I had, proclaimed it indeed, a “perfect crime.” You’ll have to leave some stuff out, Bob said, or it will be a template for someone to actually use and get away with it. He went on to say that I could either do the crime myself or publish the novel and I’d probably make more doing the crime. Well, at one point in my life I would have been tempted, but I’ve since been in prison and that isn’t an option these days… And, I did take his advice to leave a couple of things out. I really don’t want someone to use it and if they don’t know the parts I omitted, they’ll stand a chance of getting caught, especially with today’s CSI units.And now, I have a publisher and it’s coming out! We don’t have a firm date yet, but it will be available by the end of the summer from StoneGate Ink. Check out their link at http://www.stonegateink.com/ for updates and ordering information. I’ll post that info here as soon as we get a firm date.The publisher, Aaron Patterson, is doing some remarkable things with books. He’s created the new paradigm for authors and literature and it’s spot on. What he’s doing is the best thing that’s ever happened for us writers. In fact, I was so impressed with him that I recommended him to Jennifer Wilkov, hostess of the top-rated show on WomensRadio, for an interview, which came on today. You can hear Aaron at http://www.womensradio.com/episodes/Your-Book-Is-Your-Hook!-Show--Aaron-Patterson%3A-Best-Selling-Author-and-Publisher-Stone-House-Ink/9775.html. I discovered this press through an old friend of mine, Vince Zandri. Vince and I have been buds ever since we were classmates at Vermont College, getting our MFA’s and hanging out at Charlie O’s. We hit it off immediately and have remained steadfast friends forever. We’re big fans of each other’s work and have each blurbed the other’s books. At the time we were in school, I was looking for a new agent and Vince hooked me up with his, the aforementioned Jimmy Vines. Jimmy did even better for Vince, getting him heavy-duty advances for his work. One for $175,000. In the intervening years, Jimmy left the business, and the publishing industry began to change. Vince discovered Aaron’s company and began to publish with him and now he’s the “star” of the company. He’s selling more now than he ever did with the legacy publishers and he did pretty well with them. Much “gooder” now… Like to the tune of selling 100,000 copies in a month! In another of those turns life takes, Vince was looking for a new agent and I was able to recommend and introduce him to my guy, Chip MacGregor, who happily took him on. What goes around comes around… Check out Vince at http://vincentzandri.blogspot.com/. His only flaw is that he will never be able to keep up with me drinking… Maybe that’s my flaw… Depends on your perspective, I suppose…And, check out THE PERFECT CRIME when it comes out! Just don’t use it for the template for your own perfect crime. There’s a tiny flaw in it that if you don’t figure it out, may land you in a six by eight room with a guy who looks like your worst screamin’ meemie nightmare and involved with him in a heavy debate over who’s going to be playing the prom queen role in the near future…I hope the above proves of interest to the writers out there. This isn’t stuff that’s reported on in English class or even your MFA workshops as a rule… The Cosa Nostra has very little on publishing…Blue skies,LesNext post, I’ll talk about JUST LIKE THAT, the other StoneGate Ink novel coming out along with THE PERFECT CRIME. This is a road novel, based on an experience I had with a former cellmate of mine at Pendleton. It’s about 85% autobiographical. The only reason it isn’t 100% is that pesky statute of limitations thing…"},

The copyright notice is for the benefit of the legacy publishers--if they try to use it for one of their covers, we are coming after them with bare knuckles.”Note: The name “Bare Knuckles Press” was chosen to reflect books the publisher and editor feel are “books worth fighting for.”Generally, as Eddie tells me, book covers are tightly-held secrets in publishing. In his words, “They want to create suspense and surprise. We at Bare Knuckles Press have a different philosophy. We want discussion. And we mean it. We are not talking about false thermostats that give people the false belief that they can control the temperature in their office, when in fact it’s just a box on a wall that is not connected to anything. Because that image is still just a treatment, we would love to see your readers’ feedback. And we will seriously consider their comments as we continue working on the cover.”Here are some additional notes, Eddie gave me. “The final piece should be in color, perhaps blue monochrome, though still shadowy. It should also be painterly. Currently, it looks like a panel from a graphic novel. The artistic style of the cover should be consistent with the narrative’s high and serious purpose—Crime and Punishment. Other than those, the only adjustment I would like to see made is turning the hand around so we see the fingers more, with an upturned arc, so they suggest a questioning that softens the combativeness of the heaving chest. Right now, it seems the inmate is simply uttering an existential cry. Turning the hand slightly, would very subtly change it into an existential cry for an explanation. Basically, it becomes Job questioning God in prison. Right now the message is more like Martin Luther at the Council of Worms, 'Here I stand. I can do no other.'”Eddie went on to say: “Danda's talent really shows here--is in the way the inmate's head is given great attention by the background light. Yet the overall feeling is one of confinement. He is surrounded by bars. Another thing I liked very much, and here I think it is very subtle, is the position of the inmate's body to the open cells. It's not really clear which cell is his. Were he closer to the any one of them, then this sense of uncertainty would not be there. However, the uncertainty remains. Yet, here is the genius of the positioning; there are three places he could go. And each one is as bleak as the other.”As you can determine, by my editor’s careful remarks, Bare Knuckles Press is paying a great deal of attention to the cover. This isn’t something they’re just throwing to some hack artist to whip out in a day or two. They pay the same meticulous attention to the editing of the manuscript, believe me! I am working harder on rewrites for THE RAPIST than I have for any other book I’ve written. It’s an intense labor and I feel I am in the hands of literary geniuses. We, as writers, often decry the lack of a Maxwell Perkins in today’s literary climate, but I feel I’ve been fortunate and blessed to have two brilliant editors in Eddie Vega and Cort McMeel who operate at the same level as Mr. Perkins did in the golden age of literature.This novel is unlike any I’ve ever written—before or since. It is a brutally honest novel; one with which I shut out the voices of the censors, both without and within, and dug down deep inside to that dark place most of us avoid, and with one goal in mind—to deliver the best truth I was capable of. Early reviews by accomplished authors I respect, seem to offer some proof that I’ve achieved my objective, as it has been compared to work by such writers as Camus, Celine, Faulkner, Poe, and Bukowski. That’s very heady praise and I have to admit it feels good, but the proof will be when it’s finished and “out there” and how the public perceives it.I do know one thing—it won’t be a book the politically-correct crowd will endorse. And that, to me, is a very good thing. My aim is that it fit the description, Jean Paulhan wrote in the preface to the infamous Story of O, where he said, “Dangerous books are those that restore us to our natural state of danger.”I’m hoping that readers will relay to us any ideas they might have to improve the cover. As Eddie says, they’ll seriously consider your input.Hope you like the cover! Your comments are welcomed!Blue skies,Les"},
{"title": "GREAT OPENINGS FOR YOUR NOVEL, SHORT STORY, OR MEMOIR DEPEND ON...", "date": "Saturday, May 28, 2011", "text": "…beginning in the right place. Once the writer understands this very basic concept, all of the “rules” begin to make sense.And, what is the “right place?” To start with, it’s important to have an understanding of what stories are, either in fiction or in memoir. To wit: A contemporary story is about one thing and one thing only—trouble.If that’s true… and it is… then that’s where the story must begin. With the trouble.No place else.What is “trouble” in a literary sense? Trouble is a story problem. While it can have many facets and permutations, it is a single, compelling problem. One that will occupy the protagonist from page one until the last page. It has to be compelling in that the audience will buy it as a problem significant enough that they will invest their time, energy, interest, and sympathy in. While the story problem is a single problem, it has two parts. The first part is what I choose to call the “surface problem.” That is the problem as the protagonist sees it in the beginning. However, the surface problem is only symptomatic of a deeper, more psychological and underlying problem that it reflects, which I’ve given the term “story-worthy problem” to. Perhaps an example is the best way to explain this.In the movie Thelma & Louise, Thelma’s (the protagonist) surface problem is that she’s in an emotionally-abusive relationship with her husband Darryl and she suddenly realizes it’s gone beyond a bad situation into an intolerable one. Her goal becomes to escape his domination for a weekend vacation with her best friend, Louise. Her surface problem is that she’s forced to exist in a world dominated by Darryl. She doesn’t realize what her deeper problem is until she goes through the struggle to resolve her surface problem. At the end, and as a result of that struggle, she finally comes to the realization that her problem is much bigger than Darryl—it’s that she’s forced to live in a world dominated by men and that’s her story-worthy problem.The “trouble” story-wise, is when she reaches her tipping point and finds herself at the place where she can no longer ignore or tolerate her situation with Darryl. That’s when the trouble begins, story-wise. Not before, even though she’s been in this situation with him for eight years. The story can only begin when the problem achieves the critical mass that she can no longer rest until she resolves it. Everything before that—the eight years of their relationship—is only backstory and doesn’t belong in the beginning.Her story begins where it should—and where yours should—when the trouble starts and has reached the place where she can no longer put it on hold another minute.And this is where your own story should begin. When the trouble begins. Not with backstory, description, unnecessary setup or anything other than when the trouble begins.Blue skies,LesWant more stuff on beginnings? Check out HOOKED!"},
{"title": "BASIC PLOT PRINCIPLES", "date": "Wednesday, May 25, 2011", "text": "Hi folks,'Going back to some basics today--often, it helps to be reminded occasionally of things we already know, but have forgotten...Thirteen Plot Principles         1. Plausible plotting starts with cause and effect. Make sure each step in your plot has a causative event, and one or more effects. Character actions should be caused by motivation, and should have effect on the plot.2. Your protagonist should save the day (or destroy it). Protagonist is the \"first actor,” the character most active in the story. Most importantly, he/she should be the one who resolves the conflict in the climactic scene. No one else should solve the mystery, or discover the secret, or arrive just in time to save the day. The plot should force the protagonist to make choices and take actions, and the course of plot events should change in response to those choices and actions.3. Give the protagonist a goal, then take it away. The goal-driven protagonist is an active protagonist, but if you just let the protagonist achieve his goal, you'll have a linear or two-dimensional plot.  Have him lose the goal, or sacrifice it, or achieve it and realize he doesn't really want it, and you'll add the complication that makes this a real story.4. The point of plot is change. The events should cause a change in the protagonist's inner life, to trade her original goal for a more worthy one, to face a personal issue she's ignored before, or to resolve a longstanding internal conflict.5. Lead readers to the story, but don't drag them. Set up your opening scenes so readers are led to ask story questions like \"Who killed the film director?\" or \"What will happen to John and Sue's  love when Sue learns that John has been lying to her?\" The posing of the questions, and the desire to find the answers, keeps readers turning pages. That's called narrative drive. The story question is also an excellent tool to help the writer keep on track.6. Make the internal come external. Explore your protagonist's internal needs and values, and consider, how will this affect her actions? The external events will cause internal change... and the internal change will cause new external events.7. Twist a cliché. Do something new with the tried and the true. Use the clichéd plot not as something to reproduce faithfully, but as a classic human drama to explore in a new way.  Show the human depth under the stereotype: the blonde bombshell who walks into the private eye's office is worried because her elderly neighbor won't answer the door.8. Coincidence kills plausibility. Don't let a one-in-a-million event rescue your protagonist from trouble, or readers will stop believing that this person is truly affecting the course of events.9. \"Exposition is ammunition.\" Tell the readers what they need to know, but only when they need to know it, and in the most powerful way. Make them beg for it.  An essential question for all plots, but especially mystery/suspense plots, is \"What should the readers know, and when should they know it?\" Ask that every time you're set to impart some extra information about the characters or events.  Don't tell so much so early that the reader has no reason to keep on reading.10. Less is more. Don't dilute the power of your story by layering on too many conflicts and motivations, or featuring too many secondary characters and viewpoints. Instead, focus on strengthening what you have.11. Center each scene. Build it around some irrevocable event that changes the plot, and your pacing problems will vanish; readers won't be able to skip because they'll miss something important.12. Find the excitement in every scene. Aim for the strongest, most dramatic events that are plausible within the world of your plot and your characters. For example, your protagonist breaking in to an office and reading a file is more dramatic than her just overhearing the same information– but use this only if your protagonist is the sort who would, under these extreme circumstances, break into an office.13. Always go back to character. The plot should show how these particular people with these particular strengths and values and conflicts react under stress or when pursuing a goal. You'll lose readers as soon as they sense you're forcing your characters to behave in a way that fits the plot instead of their personalities and needs.Hope this helps remind some of us of basic principles we may have neglected or forgotten!This has been a busy week! Having just placed three new novels, the hard work is beginning. I've got a tentative release date (in five weeks) for the two novels Stonegate Publishing is publishing--THE PERFECT CRIME and JUST LIKE THAT. Originally, we'd contracted for another novel, THE BITCH, but have replaced it with Stonegate with a road noir novel, JUST LIKE THAT. Portions of this novel have been previously published as short stories, appearing in MURDALAND and FLATMANCROOKED and one was both in HIGH PLAINS LITERARY REVIEW, and nominated for a Pushcart Prize and also included in Houghton-Mifflin's \"Best American Mystery Stories, 2001.\" The other, THE PERFECT CRIME, was originally sold in auction to Random House, and alas, was cut when Bertlesmann purchased RH. Now, it finally gets published! I think readers are going to enjoy both of these, unless they're expecting THE BOBBSEY TWINS--these ain't one of those... And, I'm deep in edits on the noir novel THE RAPIST, being offered by the new press, BARE KNUCKLES PRESS. I'm  working with the publisher, Cort McMeel and the editor, Eddie Vega, and these guys are fantastic! I've shared early editing notes here from Eddie, and he's a tough one! I'm also getting blurbs for this one already from some real heavyweights. Eddie and Cort and some other folks are also starring up a really exciting magazine, NOIR NATION, and I think I'll have a short story in the first issue. Even if I don't, glom onto a copy, as noir master Paul D. Brazill does have one in it for sure and you don't want to miss anything by this guy!And, lastly, I've been getting all kinds of emails from those who listened to the radio interview last week with Jennifer Wilkov on her program, Your Book is Your Hook, on WomensRadio. Meeting all kinds of really cool people, mostly writers. Thanks, Jennifer!Anyway, it's been tres busy! No time for many Jack and waters, alas... In fact, this week we had to forgo our weekly Friday night romantic tryst where I shave my wife Mary's back while we sip Barq's root beer and nibble on Hostess Ho-Hos...Hope the writers out there who visit here are busy in the same kinds of ways. As that sage philosopher, Red Green, says: \"I'm pullin' for ya. We're all in this together. Keep your stick on the ice.\"Blue skies,Les"},

{"title": "TWO NOVELS PLACED!", "date": "Friday, April 29, 2011", "text": "Hi folks,Good news today!I just returned from Mail Boxes, ETC from mailing signed copies of my contract for two of my novels to be published by StoneGate/StoneHouse Publishing! Best twenty bucks for the gas for this trip I ever spent! (Reason it cost $20 was that it’s half a mile from my house and my car only gets 40 miles to the gallon…)Both novels are thrillers and were placed by my (awesome!) agent, Chip MacGregor. (I’m hoisting one to you, Chip…) Since my noir thriller, The Rapist, is coming out from Bare Knuckles Press sometime in the next year, this is fast becoming a red-letter year!Here’s the synopsis of the first, titled The Perfect Crime:Criminal genius Charles \"Reader\" Kincaid makes but one mistake in what would have been the \"perfect crime\" when he steals a Futaba remote controller from the wrong person—Jack Fogarty, the brother of retired cop Grady. Once Grady's involved in the case, his bulldog tenacity uncovers enough clues to nail his brother Jack's murderer and turn the tables in a surprising twist on Reader. Reader's plan is to wire banker C.J. St. Ives with a bomb that not only can't be removed, but is controlled by remote control. The money Reader is after is the weekly drop of illegal millions from drug czar Fidel Castro (a cousin of the more famous Fidel) which St. Ives launders through his bank. St. Ives has his own plan for stealing the same money, which complicates matters. In the end, it turns out that Reader has been orchestrating the whole affair and his real purpose is achieving vengeance over Titus Fuller, St. Ives' father-in-law and also the man to whom Castro answers. His machinations would have worked perfectly if Grady Fogarty hadn't become involved.The setting is a bit of Dayton, Ohio and a lot of New Orleans. While on the heels of Reader, Grady falls in love with animal control officer Whitney Farver and gains assistance from new friends Sally and Veronica Graziano, both retired NOPD cops who own a bar in Jefferson Parish. Also involved in the plot are Cuban drug dealers, a slimy ex-con named Eddie who loves expensive shoes, and more electronics than you'll ever see outside of a Radio Shack.*One of the things I had fun with in writing this novel, was a sex scene. Normally, I don’t like to write ‘em, mostly because just about all the original ways of showing a sex scene have been done. But, I’m proud to say that I came up with a different way to create this one. Instead of doing what many of us do—ramp up the volume with more and louder screams and deeper slashes with fingernails on backsides—I came up with the opposite tack. The first time Grady makes love to Whitney, they’re on a stakeout in a duplex and are in the apartment directly above the bad guys. The floors creak so much they can’t even walk around in stockinged feet. They do the nasty while having to remain completely silent or else they’ll be discovered and killed. Not only don’t they dare move much, they can’t breathe too heavily since the bad guys below don’t turn the TV on and the slightest sound will expose them. It turned into one of the best scenes I’ve ever written. My litmus test when writing a humorous scene is that I have to laugh out loud. And, more than just during rhe initial writing or reading. Every time. I apply the same test to sex scenes. If I don’t get physically turned on during the writing and upon subsequent readings, it ain’t working. I’m happy to report that reading this scene still turns me on… Although, that can be simply because my libido is so low, which explains the five marriages perhaps...*The second novel is a psychological crime thriller, titled The Bitch. Here’s the synopsis:In the rich vein of psychological thrillers such as Scott Smith’s bestseller, A Simple Plan, Les Edgerton’s The Bitch is the story of Jake, a two-time loser who, since his last release from prison for his second bit, has reformed his life completely. He has begun attending college, has fallen in love with and wed the beautiful Paris Meacham, and they are expecting their first child. Jake has also prospered in the hairstyling business and is just about to open his own salon. Life is good. Think: A Simple Plan meets Beloved, if you will!It’s at this point, that old cellmate Walker \"Spitball\" Joy enters his life, requesting a favor—to help Walker pull off a job. A burglary. A favor Jake can’t deny as he owes Walker for saving his life back in the joint, even though if caught, he faces being sent back to prison for life under the Habitual Criminal Statute. (Commonly referred to as \"The Bitch\" derived from the Ha-bitch-ual Criminal...) The favor? To pull off a burglary (once Jake’s specialty).The biggest guiding force in Jake’s life has always been his fierce sense of loyalty. Forced by his code of ethics to perform the crime for Walker, Jake's act sets off a chain reaction of catastrophic violence that ends with his beloved Paris dying. A story of criminals and their code of honor and how that trumps even the fierce love of a man for a woman. Jake’s once idyllic life plunges farther and faster into the abyss, to the point where, one by one, his actions are responsible for his brother’s death, he is forced to kill his mother-in-law, his friend Walker Joy, his father-in-law, and finally, in a staggering and blinding moment of self-realization, is forced to allow to die the woman he loves, Paris. He realizes at that moment that loyalty wasn’t what guided his life at all, but a more base tenet—survival. He experiences an epiphany that shows him that he’s never been any more moral than the lowest animal and he realizes his soul has been damaged beyond repair... that he's warped beyond redemption.(As a note of possible interest, Cathy Johns, the Assistant Warden of Louisiana's Angola Prison (\"The Farm\" of the award-winning documentary of the same name) has read Edgerton's work and she told Edgerton he had delivered the truest and most accurate portrayal of the criminal mind she'd ever read.)So there you have ‘em.Stonehouse Publishing is a relatively new press that has been tearing up the publishing world as of late. Their sales are off the charts and I’m hopeful that my books will soon be contributing to the bottom line. The novels should be available in a couple of months and you can bet I’ll be announcing it here. A link to their site is included in my favorite web sites here.I’m also looking for potential blurbers. I’ve got several great ones for The Bitch but haven’t sent The Perfect Crime to anyone yet. If anyone here is interested in providing a blurb, please let me know.And, it looks as if there’s possibly more good news on the way with several others of my books. The possibility of a mass market paperback sale with Pocket, a possible sale of my next writer’s how-to craft book, a YA, and my memoir, among others. I’ll keep you posted!Now, I’m off to down a bottle of Corona Dark…Blue skies,Les"},
{"title": "SOME THOUGHTS ON THIRD PERSON VS FIRST PERSON NOVEL NARRATIVES", "date": "Tuesday, April 26, 2011", "text": "Hi folks,A source of discussion that always comes up at the beginning of my classes is whether the writer should use first- or third-person. The short answer I usually give, is: “Whatever the material calls for.”Since that doesn’t adequately address the question, I go on to amplify the answer, and that’s what I’ll do here as well.First, I ask the student who wants to employ first-person why they chose that stance. Almost without exception, they’ll state, “Well, it’s just more intimate. Third person is too formal for the character I want to create for the story.”That’s when I proceed to knock a couple of holes in that theory.Before I do that, here are a few things I’ve observed. More beginning writers than established writers tend to write in first-person. Far more people who’ve been published are aware that third person is considered the “professional” pov and that first-person is often considered the “amateur” pov.Now, before everybody starts yelling at me that there are tons of excellent books out there written in first-person, let me assure you I’m well aware of that. If I may, I’d like to refer you back to my short answer: “Whatever the material calls for.” There are often times when the material calls for first person. However… not as often as is sometimes realized.Let me explain.The chief reason many agents and editors prefer third person and call it the “professional” pov, is that the overwhelming percentage of successful books and bestsellers are written in third person. This isn’t an accident. There are reasons this is the case. Actually, the overwhelming majority of manuscripts that arrive in a publisher’s or agent’s office are written in first-person. If that’s so (and it is), then why would more third-person efforts become published? Well, because many more manuscripts are submitted by beginners than by pros. By the time one goes from the beginner’s group to the published group, the numbers in the second group have dramatically diminished. That means the second group is going to be predominantly writing in third person. Fewer people by far in that group, but a much higher percentage of publishable manuscripts. Most in third person… Again, please notice I didn't say all; I said most.This simply goes back to my observation above that more beginning writers employ first-person than do seasoned pros. Editors and agents have also noted this fact. Overwhelmingly so do beginners prefer to write in first- rather than third-person. That means that when a gatekeeper encounters a first-person manuscript, it goes without saying that a little red light goes on (from his/her past experiences) that chances are pretty good this mss came from a… less seasoned writer. And, it’s just a fact of life and the business of writing that the newer the writer, the less likely the mss will be of publishable quality.Does that mean when your first-person opus lands on an editor’s or agent’s desk it is doomed from the start? Of course not. But, a writer should be aware that there’s a bit of a bias already in place against first-person. If it’s a book that should have been written in first rather than third, and it’s written well and is of publishable quality, no problem. Any good editor or agent will be able to tell within a couple of pages if it’s written well or not, no matter what pov stance the author has elected.And, why do agents and editors feel this way about first-person? This gets to the heart of the matter. The reason many hold first-person in a negative light is that anyone who’s read many manuscripts knows that a great many first-person novels are thinly-disguised autobiographies, usually espousing some recently-learned political or social philosophy, or, if not that, their imitation of some current (or just-over) line of bestsellers. At present, vampire or zombie opuses, or invincible characters who look suspiciously like Jack Reacher but have different names and perhaps a different hair style.Another reason many choose a first-person narrator is that it seems easier to newer writers. Many (many!) first novels are written with characters saying and thinking things the writer him- or herself thinks in their own minds. Novels that are fiction in name only; primarily many are just vehicles to assign the writer’s own thoughts to in a loosely-derivative plot.Those are all secondary reasons why some writers choose first-person. Overwhelmingly, however, the biggest single reason lots of writers choose first is that they feel it’s a more intimate pov. It seems to make sense. After all, if one is writing “I” from their character’s pov, one can’t get much closer to the character, can they?You saw this coming, didn’t you!Of course there’s a way to achieve the same intimacy with third person as there is with first. And, it’s easy.Simply by employing a close third person, not a formal third. A narrative that uses a close third achieves exactly the same intimacy with the reader as a first person does. The good news is that by using a close third person you get all the positives and none of the negatives of third person. The chief argument against third person usually seems to be that it isn't as intimate as first-person. Well... this just resolves that argument.The bad news is… well, there isn’t any bad news. It’s a win-win situation.And, how does one achieve this magical close third that feels like first person with none of the baggage of first? Again, it’s easy. You simply substitute personal pronouns for the character’s name. That’s it. Sounds too good to be true, doesn’t it? Well, let’s take a look. Examples are the best way to prove a point.I’ll give you a section of narrative in which a formal third is used. Then, I’ll give the same passage in first person. And, finally, I’ll follow that with the same narrative, only this time with personal pronouns in a close third person. I feel confident that as soon as you read them you’ll see and feel the difference.***From my short story, “My Idea of a Nice Thing” first published in Breeze and included in my short story collection, “Monday’s Meal.” (The two people are at an A.A. meeting and it’s about a third through the story. Raye is the protagonist.)First, the passage in a formal third person:            “My idea of a nice thing,” he said, “would be a world where you could get drunk and it wouldn’t harm you, physically, anyway.”            Raye turned and offered her hand. “My name is Raye.”            “Hi, Raye. Emory. Like the board.”            Raye didn’t quite get it at first and then she did and smiled.            “I liked what you said that time, about sorting yourself out,” Emory said.            Again, Raye didn’t get it at first, and then she realized he must have been at the meeting she’d first gotten up and spoken at.            “Well, yeah,” Raye said, “It’s kind of like that, but boy did I get in trouble saying that!”            “From Jim, right?” ‘You shouldn’t talk about the joys of drink at a meeting or a place where that’s all the people think about?’ That Jim?” He grinned, and Raye saw he had great teeth, even and white, and what was nice was the way he smiled. Like he was unaware of how great his teeth really were, that he was smiling just because he was happy or had thought of something funny. “There’s been talk of replacing ol’ Jim. He gets his meetings mixed up, thinks this is Parents Without Partners.”            There must have been something in Raye’s face that made him realize he’d said the wrong thing.            “Look, I’m sorry. Let’s get out of here,” he said. “Go get a drink.”            They use the same pickup lines here that they do in bars, Raye thought.            “I don’t mean a drink with liquor in it,” he said. “I mean a Coke or something, but in a bar. This place feels like a hospital. It’s depressing.”            “This is a hospital… Emory,” Raye added his name haltingly, knowing that once she’d said it she was going to leave with him.That’s a formal third. Now, read the same passage as first person.            “My idea of a nice thing,” he said, “would be a world where you could get drunk and it wouldn’t harm you, physically, anyway.”            “Raye,” I said, turning and offering my hand. “My name is Raye.”            “Hi, Raye. Emory. Like the board.”            I didn’t quite get it at first and then I did and smiled.            “I liked what you said that time, about sorting yourself out,” Emory said.            Again, I didn’t get it at first, and then I realized he must have been at the meeting I’d first gotten up and spoken at.            “Well, yeah,” I said, “It’s kind of like that, but boy did I get in trouble saying that!”            “From Jim, right?” ‘You shouldn’t talk about the joys of drink at a meeting or a place where that’s all the people think about?’ That Jim?” He grinned, and I saw he had great teeth, even and white, and what was nice was the way he smiled.

This place feels like a hospital. It’s depressing.”            “This is a hospital… Emory,” I added his name haltingly, knowing that once I’d said it I was going to leave with him.And, finally, the same passage as a close third. See if you don’t agree it feels exactly like first person.            “My idea of a nice thing,” he said, “would be a world where you could get drunk and it wouldn’t harm you, physically, anyway.”            “Raye,” she said, turning and offering her hand. “My name is Raye.”            “Hi, Raye. Emory. Like the board.”            She didn’t quite get it and first and then she did and smiled.            “I liked what you said that time, about sorting yourself out,” Emory said.            Again, she didn’t get it at first, and then she realized he must have been at the meeting she’d first gotten up and spoken at.            “Well, yeah,” she said, “It’s kind of like that, but boy did I get in trouble saying that!”            “From Jim, right?” ‘You shouldn’t talk about the joys of drink at a meeting or a place where that’s all the people think about?’ That Jim?” He grinned, and she saw he had great teeth, even and white, and what was nice was the way he smiled.

This place feels like a hospital. It’s depressing.”            “This is a hospital… Emory,” she added his name haltingly, knowing that once she’d said it she was going to leave with him.***See how by simply replacing the pov character’s name with personal pronouns instantly transforms it into a read that feels exactly like first person. The same level of intimacy? Kinda neat, isn’t it!How do you know when the “material calls for first or third person?” There’s a handy-dandy litmus test. If you can substitute personal pronouns for all the “I’s” in the narrative and it doesn’t affect the story… then it should be in third. If it does affect the story and in a negative way, then it should be in first. Most of the time I think you’ll find that it works better in third person. A close third person.Personally, I sometimes write in first person. Mostly for short stories. For novels, occasionally I’ll use first person, but mostly I opt for third. A close third.Try it yourself. Take a passage written in a formal third (where the pov character’s name is used often) and rewrite it, taking out all the instances where the name is used and substitute personal pronouns for the pov character’s name. (This is once the character’s name is on the page and the reader knows who the “he” or “she” is.) Then, recast it in first person and compare the close third version with the first person version and see if you don’t agree they feel pretty much the same.Or, take a previously-written passage in first person and substitute personal pronouns for the I’s. If you don’t feel any or very much difference, guess what? It might be a better pov to use.Hope this helps!Blue skies,LesLagniappe This has been a great week for good news! My agent, Chip MacGregor has just sold two novels to Stonehouse Publishing. He's working on the mass market rights with Pocket Books and will be trying to sell foreign rights at the upcoming BEA. And, I'm sailing along with the first rewrite of my noir novel, The Rapist, which Bare Knuckle Press has taken. My editor, Eddie Vega, sent me some additional notes which I'll share. Eddie writes:For now, work off the global changes I suggested. When you submit the revised mss, I will go over every inch and send it back to you with MS backtrack comments, so you can see the edits, which you can adopt or reject. As we discussed, the weakest writing occurs in the early sections. 1. You need to decide which parts are essential to the novel and which were you just cracking your knuckles getting ready to write. Leave the first kind and chuck the second kind.On rewrite, when you see sections that are important to the plot or that has background information that you think essential, but where the writing is vague, you may want to add to some details to ground it, but be careful that you don't dramatize or super detail everything. Everything is not the same. Some things deserve more attention than others. Be careful of the \"Show, Don't Tell\" rule that they throw around in writing workshops. Show what matters, tell the rest. In this way, you will be following Van Gogh's Rule of Composition: Magnify the essential, ignore the obvious.\" That's how to fix the early parts.Ask yourself of every page, what in here is essential to my story. If there is something there to which the answer is yes, dramatize it. That's the draft I want to see.Best,EddieI'll keep including in these posts our editor-writer journey. It's exciting on this end!"},
{"title": "REWRITING AND THE EDITORIAL PROCESS", "date": "Thursday, April 14, 2011", "text": "Hi folks,Time to get back to writing!I thought it might be interesting and hopefully informative/instructive to talk about the importance of a quality editor in the rewriting of our novels. One of the problems I see in the expanding world of self-publishing and e-books is the lack of quality editing in many of these books. It seems to be an uneven field at best.My own experience has been that good editing makes all the difference between a quality book and… a book.My own experience has been that rewriting a book under the guidance of a knowledgeable editor is infinitely harder and more work than the first draft entailed.My own experience is that a good editor will almost always insist on more than one major rewrite.Now, I have to admit that I’m not always crazy about facing the prospect of rewriting. In fact, if you’ve heard a loud groan coming from somewhere and don’t know the source of it, it may have been issued by me, facing the prospect of a rewrite.But, that’s just the first reaction. Always, when I get into the bowels of the book’s engine, guided by the master mechanic that a great editor always is, I start to get excited. I can see by the notes he or she has provided, by the discussions we’ve had, by the terms of the work he or she has dictated—that we are about to embark on a fantastic journey of discovery. We’re about to begin a joint effort that is going to transform that assembly line engine—serviceable, but not noticeably different from the other fourteen million other assembly line engines—into an engine that is going to win races.I’ve always had good editors. At times, I’ve had great editors. Among those I count as great are Kelly Nickell, Charlotte Wright, Rachel Vater, Jimmy Vines, and now… Eddie Vega.Some of those folks I’ve absolutely hated during the time we worked together. When we were done and I saw what they had pushed me to accomplish, my feelings toward them changed 180 degrees. It’s not important to like your editor. It is important to respect them. And, if you’re like me, that dislike for them during the time you’re working together, will change once you see what their pushing and prodding has caused you to create.I get the same thing from many of my students. At the time I’m working them to death and refusing to let them off easy or skate on anything or give praise where praise isn’t earned, I know my name gets uttered a lot in their homes, and most likely with the preface of “That frickin’ Edgerton!” (I don’t think they use the word “frickin’” however…) A great editor is going to evoke the same kind of emotional reaction from the writer he or she is editing, I imagine.I’ve also had mediocre editors whose idea of a “rewrite” was more copyediting than rewriting. Looking for better synonyms, correcting syntax, punctuation, misspellings, and the like isn’t the primary purview of a rewrite editor, but that seems to be what many editors see as their job. Mostly the kind of thing you might enlist a retired English teacher to do. Those folks aren’t editors except in the loosest and most generous definition of the term, but they seem to be all over the place.What I’m going to do in this post is open the door and let you into the private world of my editor and myself as we begin work on a new novel. The novel is a literary work originally titled The Rape. The editor is a genius named Eddie Vega. I’m doubly blessed in this endeavor as the publisher is also a genius, the writer Cort McMeel. Doubly-blessed and… doubly-cursed! I’m going to have to work and work probably harder than I ever have in my life. These guys won’t accept anything less.Together, they’re launching a new, exciting press called BARE KNUCKLES PRESS, which will publish ebooks as well as print versions. Cort is the founder of Murdaland Magazine, and Eddie was his editor on that venture. My book is one of the first signed. You can twitter them at @BKPress.The book we’re working on is an animal of a different stripe than any I’ve ever written before. In fact, I wrote it more than thirty years ago and didn’t show it to anyone until recently when I sent it to Cort. It’s a very dark, a very philosophical, a very literary noir novel. Actually, it’s a novella at a scant 133 pages, which brings its own problems as novellas are largely considered to be in no-man’s land in the publishing industry.It’s also the most honest thing I’ve ever written. In it, I’ve done what I’ve always felt a great writer should do—go deep down inside and expose those dark places we all have in the deepest recesses of our hearts but hide from the rest of the world. Expose the warts, in other words. The place inside where real truth resides. Most of us are unwilling to go that far. Most of us are willing to go a certain distance, but never all the way. Well, this one goes all the way.I’m going to show the process Eddie is putting me through. Before I begin, I need to say that Cort already had me do one rewrite of it before he sent it to Eddie. That took about a week and I suspect it’s going to be the easy rewrite when I look back after finishing it.Eddie has told me he thinks we’ll do four major rewrites before they publish it. I have a sneaking suspicion there will be more. If so, that’s all right. I know from the gitgo it’ll be worth it.We had a phonecon two days ago. Here are my notes from that, summarized:There were three major areas Eddie felt I should address in the rewrite:1. The overall structure.2. The voice of the narrator.3. The large themes of the book developed.Note that none of this concerns syntax, or synonyms or any of that other crapola… Not that those things aren’t important—they are—but they’re grunt work and not the primary concern of a good editor. That’s like asking a NASA scientist to check the wiring of your house. Sure, they might have an E.E. degree and know how to wire a house, but that’s a job for an electrician, not a top scientific mind. A great editor looks at larger issues, not the stuff that a lower-level copy editor would.Eddie wants me to go back and read some texts pertinent to this book. He insists I reread Celine’s Death on the Installment Plan for one. For the voice. He sees the voice I’ve used in the book as close to what he calls “Celine’s naturalist, ‘bad-ass’ voice, and wants me to reacquaint myself with his writing to be able to carry that voice throughout. What he didn’t know at the time was that Celine is one of my top three favorite authors. This was going to be a pleasant homework assignment!He also wants me to reread three books of the Bible. Ecclesiastes, Lamentations and Job. Spot on. I’m very familiar with all of these, due to my childhood where we were required to read the Bible daily and I’ve read the Bible completely several thousand times. Again, he wants me to reread these for the voice, especially that in Ecclesiastes. And, for the themes of the book, which echo these books. I’ve used epigraphs in the original mss from John Donne, from Cipriano de Valera (translating from St. Paul in I Corinthians) and from Borges. Eddie wants me to change those to quotations from Job and Lamentations, which makes perfect sense and will help greatly to better delineate the themes of the book as well as more clearly align the structure.Themes. Eddie wants me to identify 10-15 lines in the book that go along with the themes, and those lines will act as a kind of umbrella to teach the reader how to read the book.He wants me to reread John Gardner’s Grendel to refresh myself with how Gardner structures the sections with the philosophical discussions between Grendel and the dragon and shape mine accordingly. There are several of these discussions in my book, between the protagonist, Truman, and his warden, and also between Truman and God.What was amazing about Eddie, was he told me how I wrote the book. He said it looked to him like I’d begun not sure what the story was going to be about and then, as I discovered what the story was, began to zone in and really begin writing it. Precisely what had happened. That may seem like a small thing, but most editors wouldn’t have been prescient to have observed that. No “copy editors” would have…He wants me to go back to the beginning where a lot of telling is going on and dramatize it in the way I did later on in the narrative.Yesterday, he emailed me additional notes. Here those are:Les,Thanks for sending along the original manuscript. In the meantime, here are my thoughts on the one that Cort sent me.The novel needs a restructuring and a massively detailed rewriting. But more importantly, the requirements of a great novel are there.There were many essential elements in the earlier parts that were written around and that really called for direct treatment and elaboration. Some of this is simply the result of the writing process—the real writing begins when the writer finds the story he wants to tell. Until then he is really just feeling his way in the dark.The cosmological and religious discussions deepen the themes but they are not cleanly strung together and the middle and end sometimes exhibit a clunky stream of consciousness that does not serve the story well. The language moves from high to low in a way that does not seem to serve the voice, which seems largely consistent, a feat in itself; however, there are moments when the sharp turns in the stream do seem to work and the results are wonderful.There is a way of smoothing out the transitions and heightening the language so the mind gets on that stream and gets carried away without getting snagged on clumping logs or subaqueous stones – carried away like some of the long poetic sections of Wolfe’s Look Homeward Angel. We can get it there. But it will be work.Here some things you can fix quickly:1. Change the title to THE RAPIST. So the identity of the true rapist is left ambiguous—fate itself may be the rapist.2. Narrative voice should be something dark and angry – like Celine – or dark and brooding like Ecclesiastes. But with a sense of hope, even if slim, even if the promise is ultimately false.3. Add epigraphs at the beginning of each chapter to something from the Book of Job or the Book of Lamentations. Epigraphs should relate thematically to what is occurring in the chapter.4.  Keep cosmology and philosophical discussions – like Book of Job or discussions between Grendel and the Dragon in the Gardner novel. But should be short, just enough to suggest depth and connection to larger theme.5.  Smooth out transitions between sections. Stream of consciousness is a good technique if it’s grounded in realism (getting into the mind of someone who is drunk, or high, or depressed, or in state of agitation).6.  Provide more details of prison life, the little details that few outside would know about.7.  Add details to earlier sections, show more, tell less, dramatize more, include more dialogue.8. Reinsert execution scene with blank rifle cartridge. Delete references to Indiana, replace with “the state.”End of notes.This is a glimpse into the mind of a truly great editor. A literate person, not a guy who wants each book to look like the last mindless bestseller and whose idea of editing is to “stick more sex in this.”And, these are my marching orders for the first of at least four major rewrites.This is an ambitious book. My aim is to deliver a work of true literature—a book that makes a difference. I’m fortunate in that both Cort and Eddie share the same view and same goal.They both agree the raw elements are there. My job is to shape those elements into a definitive and noteworthy fiction with their direction. I’ve got the editors who can give the direction it requires—I just hope I’m up to the task!I hope that this glimpse into the editing process is helpful in your own writing, and for those who aren’t yet at the stage where an editor is involved with their book, will give you an idea of what to expect. My hope is that you are as lucky as I’ve been with my book!Blue skies,LesP.S. Earlier, I said it wasn’t important to like your editor, but that it was important to respect him. I’m getting a bonus with Eddie—I really like him! He’s the real deal—the kind of guy you’d want to hang out with and knock back some brews with.If you haven't yet, I'd glom onto a copy of Cort's brilliant novel, SHORT."},
{"title": "MY MEMOIR AND THE STORY BEHIND IT", "date": "Sunday, April 3, 2011", "text": "PART II This past Thursday I drove up to my mother’s house in South Bend to confront her with the truth about my father. My wife Mary came with me.All the way up, I kept trying to keep my blood pressure down, hold my anger in check. I wanted to keep myself under control and I knew it would be difficult.We knocked on her door and she came to it, surprise on her face. Mary didn’t want to be in the room with us as she felt my mother would feel “ganged up on.” Mary is the fairest, most even-minded person in the world. She’s my rock.Mary went into the living room where she couldn’t hear us on the pretext that she was going to use the bathroom.I sat down across from my mother (it rankles me to call her that), and began. “Mom,” I said. “I have something for you.” I handed her a copy of the DNA report. She wanted to know what DNA was. If you think that’s odd, don’t. She really didn’t know. She’s never had a TV or a radio and only occasionally reads a newspaper. Those represent elements of the “sinful world” that she’s spent a lifetime avoiding as well as keeping them from her children as well. Think Amish expoentialed. I know that’s not a word, but you know what I mean.“The important part is here.” I pointed to the statement in the middle. It read: Statement of Results: Based on the statistical analysis of the above data, it is 13.54 times more likely (or a 93.12349890769% chance) that Tested Sibling 1 (Les) and Tested Sibling 2 (Ann) are half biological siblings versus being full biological siblings. These results do not supersede testing involving additional participants related to Tested Sibling 1 (Les) and/or Tested Sibling 2 (Ann). Client has indicated that a common biological mother is shared between the participants listed as siblings on this report. Results are implicitly based upon this assumption. If the assumption of a common biological parent is incorrect, it is possible the reported results are inaccurate.It was written in small print and she said she couldn’t read it. I started to grab it to read it to her and instead I did what I didn’t want to do. I lost it. “It says Edgy (what she always called him) wasn’t my father.” I stood up and I was beyond angry. I was in a murderous mood. “I want to know who my real father is.” Her eyes widened and she looked like a trapped animal. “He was your real—“ I could literally see her mind working frantically to come up with a good story. “Stop it!” I said. “The DNA report says he wasn’t. DNA doesn’t lie. He wasn’t my father. All I want from you is the name of my real father.”Her response was, “I’ve been forgiven for that.”“Forgiven?” I said. “By whom?”“By God,” she said. “He forgave me a long time ago. I’m absolved of that sin. Yes, it was someone else, but I confessed to God and He forgave me.”“I want to know how that works,” I said. “Up until this minute, you were still lying to me about who my father was.”Indeed, two days earlier, she had phoned me and asked if I’d seen the news about the child who fell down a well in Midland, Texas. I hadn’t, and she told me why she was asking. She said Midland was where I was born and where my “dad” and her were married, and it had brought up memories and she just wanted me to know she was thinking about me being born.Two days before! Still embellishing the lie she had promulgated all of my life.I went on. “So, how does that work, that forgiveness thing? Since you’ve maintained that lie to me all of my life up to this moment, does that mean that every single night you bring this sin to God and he forgives you each day? Is your idea of God and forgiveness that there’s no atonement involved? That He gave you a blanket pardon that allows you to go on lying to me the rest of my life? That’s how that works?”She struggled to talk but just had no answer for that.I won’t give you a play-by-play of our entire conversation. I kept demanding to know the name of my real father and all she could come up with was that she’d tried to forget his name ever since then and all she could remember was his first name—Gail. Or, Gayle or Gale—I don’t know. She didn’t spell it.I told her she was a liar. Nobody forgets something like that. She just didn’t want me to try to find him if he was still alive or any surviving relatives of his because then the truth would come out. I was screaming at her at this point—I completely lost it. I told her she was dead to me, that she was only a mother because of the accident of birth and that she was never to come to our house or call me or be in my life in any way from then on. That all I wanted from her was the name of my father. She kept saying she didn’t know and everyone was dead now and she had no way of finding out. I wouldn’t buy it. I don’t care how you find out, I said; just do it. When you do, write me and tell me who he was. Don’t call. I never want to hear your voice again. You’re dead to me.At this point, I was screaming and Mary came in and told me to calm down. By now, my mother had gained enough time to begin fabricating a story, which she proceeded to lay on me. She said my real father had “forced himself on her.” Not raped, but forced himself on her. Later, Mary said she noted the odd way she’d phrased it. She then went on to say something equally odd. That she didn’t want to marry “a guy like that” when she found out she was pregnant (implying she’d had a choice—that he’d asked her or indicated he would). That she met Edgy and he was “everything she’d ever wanted in a man” and she decided she wanted to marry him.She said she lied to Edgy that it was his child so that he would marry her, and that years later, she confessed to him and he forgave her also. Which I knew was an outright lie from what my Aunt Lila had told me just the night before. Ann had told me Aunt Lila might know something as she was a teenager when Edgy married my mother. Lila did indeed know something. She said she remembered it as clear as yesterday. It seems Edgy had broken his leg and the Army Air Corps had sent him home (to South Bend) to recuperate. He’d been home several months when my mother contacted him and told him she was pregnant and that she wanted to get married. Aunt Lila said she was standing in the kitchen when he got the news and his dad was there and Edgy said to him that it wasn’t possible that he was the father—the time frame didn’t work at all. A month or so later, he went back down to his post in Texas, they got married, and he got shipped off to England with the 8th Air Force and then I was born a few months later.Also, when she had me, Edgy had wanted to name me “George” (yuch!) if I was a boy, but instead, she named me after him. Leslie Harold Edgerton, Jr. He was in England and didn’t know what she’d done until after he was notified by the War Department. Over the years, I heard snippets of stories about how mad it made him, but the story was that it was because he wasn’t crazy about his name either and didn’t want to wish it on someone else. I had no idea that it was really because he knew full well that I wasn’t his child. That galls me as much as anything about this whole deal does. I never liked my name before this week, and now I loathe it. I want so much to change it but that’s almost impossible for all the complexities that would entail. Also, I’d named my youngest daughter after him with her middle name (Sienna Leslie) and my son’s middle name (Michael Bud). Edgy was always known as Bud by everyone (except my mother who called him Edgy), and I was always Butch to family. Right from the first she was building her house of cards about my parentage. She also kept alive the story that I was born “premature” and that I was born without fingernails and toenails because I was a preemie. I imagine to fit the date on my birth certificate and their marriage date. I simply bought into all this and never questioned it until one day in our salon a nurse client was talking about premature babies and I spoke up about my toenail story and she laughed and said that wouldn’t have anything to do with being premature and I got an inkling that was a lie. It was just her adding another card to her house of cards.I told her I was telling everyone in our family what she had done, and that was the only time she showed any emotion. (She never cried or even came close to crying the entire time. It was clear that she was occupied solely with trying to fabricate a story that would absolve her.) She got a look of shock at this and asked if I’d told my sister Kathy. Kathy was the one sibling who had bought into her version of God and married a guy like Mom and raised all of her kids the way Mom had raised us. They never went to public school, dressed like the Amish, and I think I described them perfectly when I told Mom Kathy had created another “freak show” with her family just like Mom had with us. I told her I was sending Kathy an email as soon as I got home. That was the only time she got even a little emotional.On the way home, I got a call from her and didn’t answer it and she left a message. I wouldn’t listen to it, but Mary did and said she’d said she was sorry. That she’d meant to tell me but just didn’t. Now, she’d embellished her story to that she was “she was powerless and was forced to have sex” with this guy. And, in the next breath, reiterated that she decided she didn’t want to marry this guy (again, indicating she had the option, which doesn’t sound like rape or forced sex to me), and said again, that Edgy was “the perfect man in her eyes.” Mary observed that she really didn’t care about my feelings at all. She said what I was feeling—that this was my real father she was making these claims about and that she didn’t care at all how that might make me feel. She also said that she “thought we’d been getting along great lately” and didn’t understand why I’d blown up.The next day, she phoned again and again I wouldn’t answer and she left another message. This time, she upgraded her story and now she’d been “raped.” Again, what a mother!And, Mary revealed to me that she’d called her and talked to her the day before. Mary said that during that conversation it suddenly became clear to her that she was a cold, calculating person and she suddenly realized she was lying. It was how she was talking and what she was saying. Mary had called her from work and she just said she told her she had to go back to work and that she had to hang up.Later that night, Mom called again and left a message that “(my brother) John had come up to her house and took her out to get a new battery” for her car and that she loved me. This is what she has always done—made sure everyone knew she was in control and that she’d managed to get to John and he was on her side and buying her story.And then, my sister Ann emailed me and said that Kathy and John were giving her grief over participating in the DNA test with me! I haven’t heard from Ann since then. I emailed Ann a long message, telling her how much I appreciated her courage in helping me find out if Edgy was my real dad or not, and that I knew Kathy and John were giving her all kinds of hell, and that I was so sorry… and haven’t heard back from her yet. I will never blame Ann if she’s given in to them—she was the only one who stood beside me and I know how they can be. It looks as though not only do I not have the dad I thought I did, my mother is evil and has thrown me completely under the bus to save face with the rest of my siblings and it looks fairly clear that they have bought into whatever she laid on them. It appears as though the fact that she’s lied to me all her life and is still lying doesn’t matter. After all, I’m just a half-brother…But, what kind of mother does this to her child? I just can’t seem to get my brain or my feelings around this.In a way, I hope there is a God and that Judgment Day is exactly how she portrayed it to us. At this point, I want her to experience those flames. Just not in a forgiving mood, I guess.I only want to know who my real father is. I want to know who I look like. Whose genes I inherited. It’s funny. My I.Q. (153) is noticeably higher than anyone else in my “family.” And, my son and daughters also have extremely high I.Q.’s (all over 140). The highest anyone else in the Edgerton family has is 115. That should have told me something, I guess… Maybe what hurts the most is that I’ve been duped by someone dumber than a bag of hammers…Sorry for the soap opera, folks. I’m trying to view all of this as I have most things in my life. As material. We writers are always looking for material. I probably shouldn’t have posted all this stuff, and in the past, whenever I’ve had bad things happen, I’ve just played it close to the vest. This time I just felt different. I just want to expose in public the evil I see as my mother.If she had been a “normal” person and the reason she’d lied to me was to save my feelings, I would have forgiven her in a heartbeat. But, she was never that person. She made our childhood a living hell with her “God.” A God who wouldn’t tolerate falsehoods or any other sins.We weren’t allowed to celebrate Christmas or Halloween or Easter. Christmas was a “pagan holiday” created by the evil Catholics. Halloween was decidedly a holiday for Satan. Each year after Christmas, I’d have to invent stories about the gifts I never got when I went back to school, so I wouldn’t be seen as odd. Ann told me the other day about a similar experience she’d had. One Christmas, her elementary class had planned to have everyone bring their favorite Christmas present in for show-and-tell, and she took a doll our grandmother had sent her a year before. The hair was all matted and it was missing an arm, and when she presented it to her class, they all hooted at the “gift” and she fled the room in tears. Normal stuff at our house…We had to read the Bible every single day of our lives, and each night listen to taped broadcasts of her cult leader, Pastor Leroy Shelton, of Algiers, Louisiana who preached the depravity of man and hellfire for everyone save the very few “chosen.” The girls had to wear “modest clothing.” No card playing, TV, popular music (only hymns and only approved hymns), no makeup, no radio, no gambling, no alcoholic beverages, no cursing (and “darn” was a curse as it was obviously a substitute for “damn” which was considered a horrible word), no dancing, no dating until 18 and no car dates, no reading of anything but the Bible and a few approved religious texts by Spurgeon and Milton and the like. I had to sneak everything I read. I can’t begin to list the complete list of things that weren’t allowed, but basically anything that was fun was verboten.I was not only never given an allowance or even a single dollar in my entire life by my parents, but when I worked, I had to tithe 10% of my check each week and it was 10% of the gross, not the net. I also had to pay room and board. When I was a junior in high school, I worked five weeknights and all day on Saturday at a Kroger’s and made $40.00 a week. I had to give Edgy $20.00 of that for room and board. Along with the tithe which went to Mom and her church in Algiers. When I protested, he said to go out and price what an apartment and food would cost me and I’d see this was a pretty good deal. Besides, that I had to buy all of my clothes… and they picked them out. I had to pay for my own haircuts and they not only told me how they wanted it cut, my mother would drive me to the barbershop, sit there and tell the barber how to cut it. When I was 18. The first time I got a haircut that I actually wanted in my life was when I got out of the Navy when I was 22. When I wanted a car, I had to pay for the car, the insurance, the gas and everything… and Edgy wouldn’t let me pick out the car I wanted as I wouldn’t buy a “safe” car, so he picked it out. A gray, 4-door Plymouth sedan. At that time, no kid had a four-door car—it was the uncoolest thing a teenager could have. Gray wasn’t the color I would have chosen either… Until I graduated from high school and joined the Navy, my curfew time at night was 11:00 pm. I could go on and on, but just wanted to give a brief snapshot of the “God-culture” that I was raised with. That’s why my mother wasn’t a “normal” mom just sparing her child the knowledge that his father was someone else, and why I’ll never forgive her. To lie was the biggest sin of all. Somehow, she’s justified what she’s done as being “forgiven her” by that God.And, as it appears, convinced my siblings that she’s been unjustly accused. She grew up in my grandmother’s restaurant in Freeport and did all the jobs there, which explains a lot, I think. They say the proper training to become an actress is to learn to be a waitress… Looks like that may be accurate… She’s Oscar-worthy…Go figure.Thanks everyone for your wonderful suggestions on how to rewrite my memoir. I can’t tell you how much your views have helped.Blue skies,LesP.S. I promise not to post any more of these kinds of posts! It's been cathartic to make this public, and for that I appreciate your forbearance. Back to writing stuff!"},
{"title": "MY MEMOIR AND THE STORY BEHIND IT - PART I", "date": "Saturday, April 2, 2011", "text": "PART IHi folks,I’m going to talk about some deeply personal and painful stuff in this post, and it’s not because I want to solicit sympathy (I don’t!), but because there are a lot of writers who visit here and I’m looking for some writing advice.Some background. Years ago, I wrote a memoir I’d titled at that time, My Secret Life. It covered my life from birth until about my forties when I met my wife Mary. I’d planned on writing a second one, covering the years from that point up until the present of wherever I was then. (I’m now 68.)That memoir covered a lot of things. My criminal “career” in which I committed over 400 burglaries, my two-plus years in prison, my stints as a male escort, drug dealer, car chases with the police, several marriages, attending college and graduating after prison, getting my MFA, my career for thirty-plus years as an award-winning hairstylist, car chases with cops, womanizing, including going to bed with over 1,000 women, living with a call girl who stabbed one of my other girlfriends and tried to kill me several times, and a bunch of other stuff. Including my childhood. Which was miserable.I sold the memoir to the University of North Texas Press. They’d previously published my first novel and my collection of short stories. Both books sold out and both books won prestigious awards and were nominated for a fistful of others. Flushed with joy at this sale, I went to Hollywood to meet my new manager, Paul Bennett, to talk over our strategy of selling the screenplays I was also writing. One had just finished as a semifinalist in the Academy’s Nicholl’s Foundation Awards (I wrote it, literally, in two days and it was the first script I’d ever attempted.) Another, written in less than a week, had placed as a finalist in both the Writer’s Guild competition and the Best of Austin competition.While meeting with Paul, I told him I’d just sold my memoir. As it happened, I had a copy of the mss with me as I was doing edits from the notes provided by my editor. Paul asked if he could take a look at it and I said sure. A bit of background about Paul Bennett—he had formerly been the Vice-President of HBO. Paul was the individual who had come up with the idea of the Comedy Relief specials and had been the producer. I met Paul through his wife, Barbara. I was also teaching online for the UCLA Writer’s Program and she had been one of my students. Upon learning I also wrote screenplays, and that I didn’t yet have a Hollywood agent, she talked to Paul about repping me (he had resigned from HBO and had become a manager) and he agreed. I was his first client who wasn’t an above-the-line talent.Anyway, Paul ended up staying up all night to read my memoir. Said he couldn’t put it down. If you know anything about Hollywood managers/agents/producers you know that none of these guys read manuscripts! The next morning we met and he told he how much he liked my mss and asked me if I minded if he’d show it to the president of HBO as he thought he might be interested in it. Of course, I agreed!The next day, Paul got a phone call from this guy who said he’d done the same thing as Paul. Said he intended to read a few pages, but found he couldn’t put it down and stayed up all night reading it. He said it was the most remarkable memoir he’d ever read. He said HBO wanted it and for me not to show it to anyone else in Hollywood. He said (his words) that “it was Permanent Midnight but with balls.” He knew that UNT was publishing it and he told Paul that they (HBO) wanted it to come out in print first and gain some “legs” (audience) and hopefully get good reviews and maybe awards and then they’d produce the movie. I would get an opportunity to write the screenplay as well.Well, I went back home to Indiana on the proverbial Cloud Nine. Fame and fortune just around the corner! And then, my publisher at UNT, Fran Vick, retired. A couple of days later, the editor, Charlotte Wright (who had been my editor on both of my other books for them) resigned to take a position as Managing Editor at the University of Iowa Press (where she still is). The new editor took over and assigned my mss to a freelance editor to work with me on the editing. Things progressed smoothly for about a month. I was getting notes from the freelance guy and then… all of a sudden he wasn’t returning phone calls or emails. Couldn’t reach him. After a week of trying everything to reach this guy, I finally contacted the new editor at UNT. He said they weren’t publishing my book because “they had no record of a contract.”Well, that was fucked! To get a book published with a university press you have to jump through some serious hoops. For one thing, it has to be approved by the Regents to get a contract. And, I had a contract, but couldn’t find it. Then, as now, my “bookkeeping system” is… how do I put this?... messed up. I had (and have) huge piles of papers all over the place, a file cabinet stuffed with all kinds of folders not named, etc. I looked and looked for it and couldn’t find it. It’s still here someplace. I ended up calling Charlotte Wright at Iowa and told her what was going on.She told me she’d been expecting my call. She said she’d received similar calls from other authors who’d had their books signed by her. She said what the deal was, was that the new editor wanted to establish his own “stable” of writers and was getting rid of everyone that she and Fran had signed. She said, that indeed I did have a contract and that she could send me a copy of it and that I could easily sue UNT and win and they would have to publish it, but… did I really want someone to publish it that didn’t want it? I reluctantly agreed. At the time, I didn’t think it would be a big deal to find another publisher, especially since HBO wanted it.Turned out, it wasn’t that easy. I didn’t have a literary agent at the time and tried to sell it myself. No luck. After awhile, I just put it in a drawer and forgot it and went on with other work. About two years ago, I decided to get it out and rewrite it, which I’ve done.I was all set to send it out and my agent decided our best strategy was to sell one of my novels first. I agreed.And then, two days ago my world turned upside down.Much of the memoir (now, retitled Adrenaline Junkie) deals with a really messed-up childhood. My mother is a religious fanatic and for most of my life belonged to a cult as she continues to this day. My father abused me in many, many ways. I don’t think of myself as a victim and didn’t write that portion of my memoir as a victim, but just wrote about some of the events that took place. You can only be a victim if you allow yourself to be and I won’t allow myself to be. Actually, I've always looked at experiences like that in my life as \"material\" and been thankful for it. I'm grateful in many ways that I didn't have an Ozzie and Harriet childhood. How boring is that!What turned my life upside-down? About five years ago, my sister Ann told me that our Aunt Ruth had told her and my (since deceased) sister Jo that I wasn’t my father’s child. All of a sudden, all kinds of things made sense. It accounted for the way he’d always treated me, for one. Ann offered to take a DNA test with me to see if it was true or not. I’ve wanted to ever since then, but just couldn’t afford the cost.About two weeks ago, I received a royalty check from one of my books that was much better than I’d expected and my wife Mary agreed that we could use part of it for a DNA test.The results came back the day before yesterday. He wasn’t my father. It has devastated me like nothing in my life ever has.Yesterday, I went up to South Bend to confront my mother. The guy I had always been told was my father had passed away years ago.That meeting was ugly. I’ll write about it tomorrow, but right now I’m emotionally drained and need another day to re-gather myself. In fact, I should let everything I’ve learned sit for a few years and get some emotional distance, but I want this to come out and I don’t know if I’ll live that long, so I’m going to begin rewriting it now.Which brings me to the point of this and why I’m posting it here. I wrote the original book not knowing any of this about my father. I want to rewrite it with that new knowledge but I’m not sure how to do that. I’m hoping that once I lay out the entire story that some of the writers here can advise me on how to write it. Do I just keep it the way it was originally and then add a chapter at the end with this new knowledge, or do I rewrite it from the perspective of knowing it now? It changes everything I’d written then not knowing he wasn’t my real father, but it’s the perspective that I’ve lived with all of my life until now. I just don’t know how I should present the material at this point and am hoping for some advice from someone here. I just want it to be as honest as possible.I’m also hoping there are some folks out there who can advise me on how I might find out who my real father is. My mother claims she’s tried to forget his name ever since then and all she can remember is his first name, which she said was Gail. (Or Gayle. She didn’t say how it was spelled.) I’ve demanded she tell me, but don’t know if that will happen. She’s still lying about most of what happened. I’ll explain more about that in the next post. At the time I was conceived my mother was a student at Baylor University. I think the guy who was my biological father was also a student there. Since I was born in February, 1943, he would have been a student there nine months before, I assume, in 1942. Since my mother was a sorority girl, I’m assuming he was in a fraternity. I’m thinking that if I can somehow see copies of yearbooks or fraternity records there might be a photo of a “Gail” or “Gayle” and I might look like him. One of the things that has bothered me all my life is that I don’t look like my pretend dad or any of my siblings. Like other stuff, that now makes sense!I’ll post more tomorrow and about my meeting with my mother. If anyone can help me out, I’ll be forever in your debt. And, I’m not looking for sympathy at all. I’m dealing with it, but the most important thing in my life has become finding out who my real father was. He may even still be alive. I may have other half-brothers or sisters! My son and two daughters also want to know who their real grandfather is and his history.Thanks, folks.Tomorrow, like Paul Harvey, I’ll post “the rest of the story.”Blue skies,LesP.S.

{"title": "PAST TENSE OR PRESENT TENSE?", "date": "Friday, April 1, 2011", "text": "Hi folks,I’ve been reading some interesting blogs and newsletters on the pros and cons of casting novels in either present or past tense so I thought I’d chime in with some thoughts of my own.PRESENT OR PAST TENSE: To be… or I have been…I have a strong instinct against present tense. Maybe it’s not an instinct so much as it is a feeling (or maybe a bias?) garnered from sixty-plus years of reading fiction and experiencing the vast majority of that canon as work cast in past tense. I try not to get set in my ways—it’s a decided curse if you teach writing not to be aware that writing tastes, usages and customs change all the time, and if I plan to remain au courant, I had best be aware of the cutting edge of all of that. However, I suspect my dislike and distrust of present tense stems from deeper roots than just the fact that most of the novels I’ve experienced were written that way.I have a suspicion that my bias may have a more rational cause. That it might be that just as basic story structure—that “beginning, middle and end” thingy—is ingrained in us as writers for a simple reason—it’s the “natural” way of telling stories. That, as storytellers we know that the story we are telling has already happened and the listener or reader knows that as well, makes it logical to acknowledge that fact and tell our stories as they happened… sometime before the telling. So why not tell it that way? As something that’s already taken place. Makes sense, doesn’t it? I mean—everybody gathered around the campfire listening knows the tale isn’t taking place at that moment, right?Another factor that enters into my own prejudice against present tense is that we almost never saw it until about 15-20 years ago. And, then, it began to spring up. Almost exclusively with beginning writers. It became obvious that it was a ploy intended to show the writer’s “originality.” Unfortunately, in most cases, it was the only thing on the page that was original. The story itself usually wasn’t. In talking to students who submitted present tense stories, most admitted they used it to “stand out” or “look different.” To which I replied, “Perhaps if you wrote an original story and used original language, that might work better. That’s kind of what most gatekeepers are looking for instead of tricks or variances from the customary.” Most accepted that advice. Some didn’t.A fact that many who employ present tense with the idea that it will make their manuscript stand out and look “different” is that folks have been doing so for at least a couple of decades now. It’s no longer “different” in the eyes of most gatekeepers. To some—if not many—instead of looking unique, it looks more like an act of pretentiousness and from one who doesn’t know the history of novels. Present tense isn’t new at all. Fairly old stuff.And, while there are of course, successful books written in present tense, there aren’t a lot. The percentage of published present tense novels in relationship to past tense novels is fairly small. Actually, infintestimal. There might be a reason for that…The thing is, after untold thousands of novels, most written in past tense, past tense is now considered the “present tense” of a story. It’s how we perceive it when we encounter it. It has to do with that “suspension of disbelief” we talk about. We just “feel” like we’re in the story as it’s occurring.The reason given by most who write in present tense is that it’s more immediate. On the surface, that seems to make sense. However, if you look at that concept a bit more closely, it falls apart. As readers, we’re logical people for the most part. That means that when we open a novel, we at least subconsciously observe a few things. For one, it’s in print. That means it isn’t happening at the present moment. To a logical person that kind of says that the author must think we’re kind of slow not to notice that. That indicates that perhaps the author is trying to trick or manipulate us into thinking it’s happening now. Which, is the crux of the problem, I think. A halfway astute reader knows the story isn’t happening in present time, so seeing one written as if it was kind of forcefully tells us the writer wants us to think that it is. Which, if this is the writer’s motivation, is a form of authorial manipulation. I think that the demographics of the majority of readers of present tense books that are successful will prove to be younger readers. Readers who haven’t read a great number of books yet in their lifetimes. I know this to be the case of a great many of the writers in my classes who attempt present tense. Usually, they turn out to be the least well-read of the students in the class. Please know that I’m not stating this as an absolute—I’m not. Once in awhile, an older person or even a younger person who has read a respectable number of quality books attempts present tense. But, more often than not, it’s the less well-read person who does so. If this is true, it doesn’t necessarily indicate a less intelligent readership at all. It may just be that the reader who doesn’t object to present tense narratives just hasn’t developed a bias against them. Perhaps it’s just that they’re more open-minded.Or not…I’d love to hear how others view present-tense novels.Blue skies,Les"},
{"title": "MISGUIDED ADVICE TO WRITERS ON ADVERBS, ADJECTIVES AND OTHER STUFF", "date": "Friday, March 25, 2011", "text": "Hi folks,As thinking creatures, most of us look for easier ways to complete tasks. That includes writing. Nothing wrong with that—it’s a mark of intelligence. Sometimes, though, that approach can get us in trouble. We seem to have a need for shortcuts and sometimes end up relying on bumper sticker kinds of slogans to guide us in our writing.Sayings like: Write what you know. That’s about the silliest advice ever given a writer. If we wrote “what we knew,” we’d be unable to write about murder… unless we’d murdered someone. We’d find it impossible to write stories set in the future or the distant past… unless we’d lived a thousand years or had a time machine. We couldn’t write from the opposite gender’s pov. Or, from the pov of an animal. We couldn’t write about anything we didn’t personally know about. The proper advice is: Write what you can convince the reader you know. Problem is, that doesn’t fit on a bumper sticker as easily…Another of those bumper sticker slogans thrust upon writers is: Show, don’t tell. Like most of these nifty sayings, there’s a germ of truth buried there. The fact is, there are plenty of times in fiction when telling works much better than showing and is the proper thing to do. You can’t show everything. If you did, you’d end up with a… screenplay. This is one reason novels are longer than screenplays. Three-four hundred pages versus a hundred. A lot of those additional pages are devoted to… telling. Exposition/summary. It’s one of the advantages of a novel over a screenplay for a literary or reading experience.Witness:It was not that he was a cowed or naturally timorous person, far from it; but he had been for some time in an almost morbid state of irritability and tension. He had cut himself off from everybody and withdrawn so completely into himself that he now shrank from every kind of contact. He was crushingly poor, but he no longer felt the oppression of his poverty. For some time he had ceased to concern himself with everyday affairs. He was not really afraid of any landlady, whatever plots he might think she was hatching against him, but to have to stop on the stairs and listen to all her chatter about trivialities in which he refused to take any interest, all her complaints, threats, and insistent demands for payment, and then to have to extricate himself, lying and making excuses—no, better to creep downstairs as softly as a cat and slip out unnoticed.That kind of looks like “telling” or “exposition” to me. And it is. It’s also from a pretty good country writer—a guy named Dostoevsky and it’s from a book which has enjoyed healthy sales, a little tome titled Crime and Punishment. Bet that bumper sticker (Show, don’t tell) wasn’t on his writer’s buggy…Sayings like: Avoid adverbs and be sparing of adjectives. Which just happens to be the point of today’s discourse.Why on earth would a writer avoid using adverbs? They’re a legitimate part of speech and, if used properly can be among the strongest tools in the writer’s toolbox. Most will claim they’re the weakest, but I’ll show you some examples where no other part of speech works as well.The same deal holds with adjectives. Used properly—which means with originality—they can transform your prose.So where does this advice come from? That’s easy. It comes from the selected reading style of many writing teachers. By “selective reading” I mean lazy reading. A person who sees part of a piece of advice, but either ignores the rest of it or just doesn’t see it—it’s invisible to him or her. If it doesn’t come from lazy reading, it perhaps comes from a predilection for… lazy teaching. It’s just so much easier to tell our little charges to eschew adverbs and most adjectives, rather than actually reading the writer’s work and showing him or her which work well and which don’t and why. To do that would be… work. Or, perhaps this advice comes from the fruit of the same tree—the instructor simply parrots what was taught him or her and accepts everything his or her mentor passed on as gospel without challenging it. Again, a form of laziness.John Gardner said, “Adverbs are either the dullest tools or the sharpest tools in the novelist’s toolbox.” Mark Twain said, “When you catch an adjective, kill it.” William Zinsser said, “Most adjectives are… unnecessary. Like adverbs, they are sprinkled into sentences by writers who don’t stop to think that the concept is already in the noun.”Here’s how several generations of writers have read these guys’ advice.Don’t use adverbs and adjectives.Which… isn’t exactly what they said. They’re like the Paul Harvey’s of writing instruction. Well, they’re like half of a Paul Harvey. They kind of forget to include that famous “rest of the story.”You wonder if those who keep parroting this advice on adverbs and adjectives have read what these guys actually said. All of those folks quoted are good, if not, great writers and teachers. Makes sense that what they’re telling us is sound, right? Well, if we actually read what they said precisely. Nary a one of them said: Don’t use adverbs and adjectives. Just about every one of them had a disclaimer. Gardner: “…or the sharpest tools in the novelist’s toolbox.” Zinsser: “Most adjectives…” Notice he didn’t say all; he said most. That sort of means that some adjectives and adverbs work and work well. Zinsser also went on to say: “…they are sprinkled into sentences by writers who don’t stop to think…” And, that’s the source of the problem. Writing instructors who pass on these “rules” haven’t stopped to think themselves perhaps, so they’re incapable of recognizing students as being any different from themselves. Writers who just maybe… do stop to think.What each of these guys is maintaining is that adverbs and adjectives are fine to use… if used judiciously. With originality. That’s the… rest of the story. The important part that never seems to be delivered in some classes and books.I took a lot of the information here from three sources. One, from the best writer’s textbook ever written, Janet Burroway’s Writing Fiction and from a 2006 article by Ben Yagoda in the NY Times, which you can accesss at: http://www.nytimes.com/2007/03/11/books/chapters/0311-1st-yago.html?_r=1&pagewanted=2 . Also, some of the material here can be found in my writing book, Finding Your Voice.Used thoughtfully (which some of these writing advisers don’t think you’re capable of, alas), adverbs and adjectives can sharpen and illuminate your prose magnificently, as in the following examples (italics mine):\"In those trusses I saw a reminder of a country-fairgrounds grandstand, or perhaps the penumbrous bones of the Polo Grounds roof.\" -Roger Angell on the gridwork at the new baseball stadium in Baltimore \"She shook her head, and a smell of alembicated summer touched his nostrils.\" -Sylvia Townsend Warner \"The Sunday's events repeated themselves in his mind, bending like nacreous flakes around a central infrangible irritant.\" -John Updike \"He had the surface involvement-style-while I had the deep-structural, immobilizing synovial ballooning of a superior mind.\" -Nicholson Baker on Updike    “She had been to Germany, Italy, everywhere that one visits acquisitvely.” Elizabeth Bowen, The Last September“She jammed the pedal to the floor, and like something huge and pre-historic and pea-brained, the Jeep leapt stupidly out of its stall.” Sharon Sheehe Stark, A Wrestling Season“So closely had we become tied to the river that we could sense where it lay and make for it instinctively like cattle.” W.D. Wetherell, Chekhov’s Sister“When Sula first visited the Wright house, Helene’s curdled scorn turned to butter.” Toni Morrison, Sula“With a bladdery whack it (the boat) slapped apart and sprang away.” Sharon Sheehe Stark, A Wrestling Season“Hank was not accepted at Harvard Law School; but goodhearted Yale took him.” John Updike, “The Other”“On the far side of the room, under the moiling dogs the twins are playing.” Francois Camoin, “Baby, Baby, Baby”Are you gonna tell these people not to use adjectives or adverbs?My advice isn’t to eliminate adverbs and adjectives at all. Use 'em! Just take some time and use them in an original way. They’ll elevate your writing if you do. Just about everybody who is writing these days is culling out their adverbs and pruning their adjectives. If you can learn to use both in truly original ways, whose work do you think is going to stand out?You might wonder if I’ve ever given any of my writing students advice to not use adverbs and adjectives. Well, sure. Nobody’s perfect! I’ve also changed. Like they say: If you’re green, you’re growing—if you’re ripe, you’re rotten.” I hope I’m green enough to not keep telling folks the same things, ad nauseum. Especially if I discover the advice was wrong. In this case, I think it is.The next time somebody delivers a writing “absolute” to you—especially one that could easily fit into a bumper sticker--you might want to look at it with a clear and open mind. Don’t trust everything you hear. In fact, your own instincts are often much better than what others may tell you. Chances are, you’re a writer because you were a reader first, and it’s that reading experience that I suspect has given you the best body of advice you’ll ever get for your work. You’ve already internalized most of what you need to know from reading lots and lots of books. Use it. It’s trustworthy most of the time.Hope this helps!Blue skies,Les"},
{"title": "SUSPENDING ONE'S DISBELIEF IS SOMETIMES JUST TOO BIG OF A CHORE...", "date": "Monday, March 21, 2011", "text": "Hi folks,A friend of mine just recommended a zombie novel to me, and it got me to thinking. Now, I’ve never read a zombie novel (on purpose, anyway—sometimes novels I’ve picked up have turned out to be zombie-like in their execution—kind of a lumbering, living-dead piece of work...), and have no interest in them personally. Same with vampire or werewolf stories. I can suspend my disbelief for a lot of things, but not for things I know absolutely can never happen or ever exist. My imagination is limited that way. It’s because of this failing that I don’t watch horror movies. Just strains credulity too much. If I know it’s impossible to happen, I simply can’t get scared about it.It’s like those so-called horror movies with the recurring baddie with the hockey mask, and covered with four gallons of what looks suspiciously like blood. The plot seems to be about the same in all of them. A group of college kids goes on spring vacation and are attacked by this 6’8” guy wearing a bloody hockey mask. His brother, who appears in other movies and kills the first cousins of the aforementioned college kids, has gardening shears for hands. The other members of hockey-mask guy's family are weird and not nearly as normal as these two guys.From the beginning, I sense this is going to be a comedy and not a horror show. Most halfway-bright college kids (I know; that's an oxymoron...) go to Padre Island or Florida or Bermuda. Not these geniuses. They opt for a place that looks more like the Dismal Swamp. It always looks like a location perfect for a Roger Corman movie and not a James Bond movie. You can tell these folks most likely aren’t going to be picking up Rhodes Scholarships at graduation, just by their choice of vacation spots. They pull up to the cabins in their Land Rover and unpack. About ten minutes later, after having some four-star sex with the Brad Pitt lookalike, one of the cute little coeds goes to use the john and finds a head floating in the toilet. She screams, they all come a’running, and… nothing. Five minutes later, everything seems to be back to normal. After popping a top and sharing some brews and having a summit meeting, they all decide to… \"be more alert.” These are the people who are going to become senators and Presidents and even Vice-Presidents? Come to think of it, that makes sense…How did this girl think that head got there? That the person was drunk and ralphing and the toilet lid fell on him? At this point, I always ask myself: What would a halfway intelligent person do? My answer—while not very original, I admit—is pile back into the Land Rover and get out of Dodge. Not these honor roll habitués. Nope. By golly, they paid their deposit so they’re staying! In fact, at any point during the next day or so when things get worse (and they always get worse, which these kids would know if they’d ever seen a horror movie, which it appears they haven’t.) Which begs the question—if these kids don’t go to horror movies, who does? They would appear to be the perfect audience. Maybe they do go to them, but their powers of retention aren’t that great. That would be appropriate to their demographic, I suppose…But, I digress…One by one, the hockey-mask dude kills them off. Oh, yeah—the hockey-mask dude. The town the Dismal Swamp is located near is a burg of about 28 people. This guy’s been doing his thing for at least a dozen years (as attested by the Roman numerals on each title)… and they haven’t caught him yet? This has to be the most inept police department since the famous one in Mayberry. I mean, the guy’s 6’8”, always wears a hockey mask, always is blood-covered… and you’re telling me he never has to go to the 7-11 for a loaf of bread? No one’s ever seen him except during spring break and then only after he’s bagged his quota of college students? These cops need to take a basic forensics class, watch a good TV show about crime fighters, take some notes. Read Lee Lofland's blog occasionally. Get a clue. You’re telling me this guy never visits the local Blockbuster’s or the barber shop? At least the local sporting goods store to stock up on hockey masks? If nothing else, you’d think the boys in blue (or khaki) here might be excused for their ineptitude the first time this guy showed up and began rendering coeds room temperature in particularly gross and messy ways, but after say the seventh or eighth year in a row, you’d think one of these Deputy Dogs would think to mark the station house calendar for the next year’s spring break and go on high alert come Easter. But, nope… they’re always caught by surprise. Here’s a town could use a recall election…And then, one by one, he knocks off each student in increasingly nasty and Technicolor ways. Each one bleeds more than the last one. This is a bad guy who sneers at strangulation. Do these kids leave? No way, Jose! They paid their deposit, by golly, and they’re staying. And always, he knocks them off, one by one, until there’s only one left. The blondest blonde, with the shortest short-shorts. Always. If I was this blonde and I’d seen one of these movies before, I think I’d be uglying myself up, throw on something the Amish might wear to Sunday-go-to-meeting. Smear river mud all over my face instead of the Mary Kay. Maybe… dare I suggest it? Get in the Land Rover and go home?Nah. Not the wannabe Miss Allen County. Her most serious thought is daydreaming what she’s going to say in her acceptance speech when she’s awarded the tiara. That thing about opening a suntanning salon for world peace and a greener, gentler world where everybody hugs trees and adopts a housebroken baby seal…Long before the last comely coed is running for her life from the hockey-mask dude—which brings up another observation—she’s always running as fast as an gold medal Olympic sprinter and he’s lumbering in slow-mo… but he always catches her! How does this work, exactly? Is she like a rabbit, running in circles, and the hocky-mask guy like a beagle? It’s the only thing that makes sense. It’s at this point, I want to yell at the screen, “Hey, yo, babe! There’s a Land Rover in the drive.” I feel kind of like that kid in recent commercials who’s watching a Western with his parents and they’re watching a scene where two cowboys are beating each other’s brains out and the kid says to his folks, “They do know they’ve got guns, don’t they?” Kind of the same deal here...The zombie writer-dudes have enrolled all their zombies in the hockey-mask dude School of Running. They all lumber along at a brisk pace of about 0.0003 mph, being passed on the left by stampeding turtles... and they catch the healthy people who, if they only knew it, would only have to skip back half a pace to escape their clutches... Anyway, long before that last exciting (this is an example of irony, in case you missed it) chase scene, anyone with an I.Q. higher than the age of their eldest child is rooting for the bad guy. These college students are all from the low end of the gene pool and the bad guy is doing a society a huge favor—these kids may procreate! Now, that’s a horror movie!And that’s why I can’t buy into stories that I know can’t possibly happen.You know what are worse?Movies about angels. How come nobody points out the anatomical impossibility of movie angels? Look at ‘em! They have wings, right? No problem there. How else they gonna get around to do their good deeds and report in to The Big Guy for the weekly budget meeting? But… they also have arms. How in the hell does that work? Have you ever seen a bird with wings… and arms? That’s an extra pair of appendages that never ever happens in nature. Not even in prehistoric times clear back to the 1950’s. No one’s ever found the fossil of a creature that had both wings and arms. It’s one or the other, director-dude. If you’ve got wings, you can’t have arms also. Just. Not. Possible. How on earth can one manage to suspend their disbelief if you’re expected to buy into creatures that have wings and arms? A realistic angel movie would do away with the arms and have the angels eat just like birds in all fifty states and many foreign countries do. By pecking. Ever seen an angel movie with the angels pecking? That would at least appear realistic.You have to wonder about the originality-factor of a writer who would model his angel character after an insect. Kind of a Rube Goldberg creation. Hey, I think I'll just stick some wings on this gal and call it an angel. Now, I'll just go teach my class in creative writing and finish this puppy up after supper... And, you never see angels eating, do you? Another hard-to-explain anomaly. There are little kid angels who supposedly grow up to be big boy and big girl angels and even old-dude angels with white beards and modest hunchbacks. How do they do that without eating some stuff? It would also help establish some credibility if we knew they took a crap once in awhile. They wouldn't actually have to show them in the process of taking a dump or a whiz, but at least show them heading for the little building out in back with the half-moon on the door once in awhile with the Reader's Digest in hand. Or wing... With a roll of Heavenly Toilet Paper...And, what’s up with unicorns? Not only do they have a wine bottle corkscrew sprouting out of their noggins, which is actually kind of handy for the alcoholic unicorn set—they have wings. Again, in real life if you have a pair of wings hooked onto your body, you have to give up two other appendages. Both angels and unicorns have six. Count ‘em. Six.Modeled after a katydid... Speaking of unicorns, aren’t they supposed to always be peaceful critters? If that’s true, why are they the only equines equipped with deadly weapons? Sure don’t look peaceful.I’m not even going to mention mermaids. Although, it occurs to me that they could perhaps use the extra two legs unicorns have and at least both would appear to be realistic, anatomically. And, I know families sometimes read this, so forgive me (avert your eyes kids), but I’ve always been curious about how a mermaid manages sex… Come to think of it, I’ve never seen one who wasn’t nude, and there doesn’t appear to be any equipment there… Like the Aleutians, who supposedly don’t have a word in their language for supercalifragilisticexpialidocious, mermaids don’t have a word for “spread ‘em,” unless they’re talking about mermaid cops and underwater law enforcement.What’s even scarier than audiences that buy into all of this, is that there are people living among us who actually believe in vampires, werewolves, and six-appendaged angels and unicorns. And mermaids. Really. It’s the truth. They could easily be your next-door neighbor!Now, that’s scary!"},
{"title": "THE RUBBER DUCKY", "date": "Thursday, March 17, 2011", "text": "The Rubber Ducky(From Sydney Lumet’s and Paddy Chayevsky’s writings on the subject.)I am going to rant about the \"Rubber Ducky\" theory of backstory for a bit. I’m using material from Sydney Lumet and Paddy Chayevsky, which were intended for screenwriters, but apply just as much for novelists.The \"Rubber Ducky\" is Paddy Chayevsky's term for when the hero or villain, at a lull in the action, explains that he is the way he is because his mother took away his rubber ducky when he was three. It's always a nice scene, well acted, beautifully lit, with a powerfully written monolog that the writer spent days on. And totally unnecessary in most stories and overused… It usually comes from not trusting the reader’s or viewer’s intelligence to “get it”…It’s also the source for many of those godawful “prologues” in newer writer’s manuscripts. It’s often their protagonist’s Rubber Ducky and as such is a total waste of paper and/or electrons.The character's past may be crucial to your story. Batman is haunted by the murder of his parents by a mugger when he was small. That's why he likes to dress up in latex and beat the tar out of muggers. In The Terminator, the hero's past, which is in the future, is the hellish future of the entire human race. It sets up the stakes for the whole movie. In movies like these, we do need to know about the hero's past. You will need to keep coming back to that past, to give it the weight it deserves. Both Batman and The Terminator, in fact, start with the hero's backstory before getting into the main story. But if all you're trying to do is give your hero more emotional depth, for the sake of emotional depth, without integrating his backstory into your story, you are running the risk of awakening the dread Ducky. The strongest way to create a sense of character is to give the character things to do and say on screen that give us a sense of a person. If the character's personality doesn't leap off the page, readers will feel that the character is flat. And personality is created by how he or she reacts to the obstacles encountered in the struggle. How he or she is proactive in resolving the story problem and isn’t simply reactive or passive. Development executives will ask to know more about the protagonist's past. You will surrender to the urge to put in a Rubber Ducky. Then if the picture becomes a go, the actors will get attached to the Rubber Ducky scene, because it shows they can Act. So the Ducky stays in the picture. (To its detriment.) In novels, the same thing happens when the characters are seen as flat. Many times, in my classes and in private coaching of novelists, I’ve advised the writer that their protagonist just wasn’t interesting. Almost always, the first reaction is to give him/her a Rubber Ducky, thinking that giving him some traumatic experience in his or her past will render him a more interesting character. Except… it doesn’t. Way back then, when the Ducky took place, sure, that may have been interesting. That was then, this is now. The Ducky is ancient history. The reader knows the character survived so it loses most of its emotional punch.Almost always the core reason the character is flat is because the author is delivering him one of two ways. One, he gives us a character who is predominantly in his mind. We’re mostly witnessing the protagonist’s thoughts. He’s just not doing anything but… musing. Musing doesn’t affect the emotion of a reader. Only one thing affects the readers’ emotions—the character acting on his/her behalf to resolve a problem. With… action. The second way the protagonist is rendered uninteresting is that he engages in a lot of dialog. He “solves” story problems by… talking. It’s the same thing, basically, as a character ruminating about in his head. The only difference is the writer is delivering the same thing by having the character say those thoughts out loud. To another character. While dialog is part of action, that brand of dialog isn’t. This is a common fault of beginning screenwriters as well as novelists. Newer screenwriters, in particular, have bought into a myth that movies are mostly dialog. Plays are, but screenplays really aren’t. A successful movie works the same way as a successful novel. The audience wants to see the characters doing something. Sometimes, that “something” is dialog, but far less than many think. A movie that depends on heavy doses of dialog has a name. It’s called a “talking heads” movie. A novel that depends on heavy doses of dialog has a name as well. It’s called “unpublished.” Or, “self-published.”A too-obvious Ducky cheapens the character. Kurt Russell's character Jack O'Neil in Stargate is suicidal because his young son killed himself accidentally with a pistol he left around the house. To make us care more about his otherwise unpleasant character, O'Neil delivers a small monologue to James Spader's character Daniel Jackson. It is important to the picture that O'Neil is suicidal, but not why; and given O'Neil's contempt for Daniel Jackson, it's unlikely that he would open up to him about his guilt and shame. The emotional truth of the situation is that Daniel Jackson would never know why O'Neil is so willing to die. It might have been more emotionally truthful for the movie never to relay this information. But I wouldn't be surprised if Kurt Russell wanted the audience to know that his character had a good reason for being such a bastard. Actors want you to have sympathy for them.A good example of a Ducky that never comes up is Thelma and Louise. It becomes clear over the course of the movie that something terrible happened to Louise (Susan Sarandon) in Texas; that's why the two women take the long way around to the Mexican border. You begin to realize that she must have been raped in Texas, and then disbelieved in court. That she probably shot her attacker which was why she ended up in jail. But Louise never says anything explicit about it in the movie, and that makes her backstory all the stronger. It’s only delivered via hints. And, the first hint doesn’t even appear until more than a third of the way into the movie.If development execs are asking you for the Ducky, the screenplay isn't working for them. Don't give them the Ducky, but do focus your scenes so they show the character. Go through your script again, scene by scene, and make sure that every time the hero acts, it shows us who he is. Make sure you communicate how he feels about what he's doing, and give him a fresh way of doing it, one someone else wouldn't have... If an agent or an editor gives you the same note, use the same strategy for making the protagonist interesting—one the reader will want to follow. Not to see his brilliant and riveting thoughts… but to see how he struggles against huge odds to gain his objective. And in original ways. Then, you’ll have an interesting character.Sidney Lumet said:In the early days of television, when the \"kitchen sink\" school of realism held sway, we always reached a point where we \"explained\" the character. Around two-thirds of the way through, someone articulated the psychological truth that made the character the person he was. [Paddy] Chayefsky and I used to call this the \"rubber-ducky\" school of drama: \"Someone once took his rubber ducky away from him, and that's why he's a deranged killer.\" That was the fashion then, and with many producers and studios it still is. I always try to eliminate the rubber-ducky explanations. A character should be clear from his present actions. And his behavior as the picture goes on should reveal the psychological motivations. If the writer has to state the reasons, something's wrong in the way the character has been written.And finally…The same principles apply to memoir. A memoir that is based mostly on the author’s own Rubber Ducky, is one that is probably going to end up largely a victim story. Unfortunately, those are pretty much over. That becomes a “me” story and we’re not much interested in those these days.Create your characters in the “present” of your story. Give him or her a compelling problem and put obstacles in their path and give them really cool and interesting (and unexpected) ways to overcome those obstacles. Keep out of their heads as much as possible. Not entirely—just less than you might be tempted to. Not as much going on in there as you might think…Hope this helps!Blue skies,LesSydney Lumet"},
{"title": "EBOOKS OR NO?", "date": "Wednesday, March 2, 2011", "text": "Hi folks,Thought I’d change it up a bit and see what people’s opinions are on ebooks. I recently visited Helen Ginger’s blog where she talked about libraries making available for loan books on e-readers. You can see her post at:http://straightfromhel.blogspot.com/2011/03/libraries-and-ebooks.htmlHelen wanted to know what people thought about libraries making ebooks available for loans to patrons. Here’s my reply:Helen, I agree (partially) with the bookstore owner who said: “There's always going to be a certain percentage of people that want their hands on a paper page… They want to be able to lay in bed and read their book--they want to be able to feel that page and turn that page.\"I agree that there are always going to be a certain percentage of people who want their hands on a paper page... although, as the population shifts in age, that demographic will shrink... but I disagree in part with the portion of his/her statement where he said folks will want to be able to lay in bed and read their book. The truth is, it's just as easy, if not even easier, to read a Kindle in bed, especially if you furnish it with a light. Even without a light, it's just as easy and perhaps even more so to read a Kindle in bed than an actual book. You don't have to worry about the pages flipping over and losing your place, etc. I fought the ebook revolution for a long time--thinking nothing could replace books--but since using my Kindle, have found I not only buy even more books (from an average of 2 books a week, I'm up to almost an average of 4--but it's infinitely easier to carry around and read in all kinds of places than an actual book. Like it or not, I think it's here to stay and increasingly, more and more people will gravitate toward ebook readers. Print won't disappear, and I think a time will come when the percentages of each will \"settle into place,\" but it will take over more and more of the market. Print will always be here in one form or another, as there are many advantages of print that electronic versions can't satisfy and won't be able to in the foreseeable future--for instance, I mark books up for learning purposes (writing techniques) and while it's possible to skip around on a Kindle, it's also a lot of trouble to do so at the present time. When they come up with a way to turn down corners to mark places to go to quickly, that will be a big plus. There are other areas ebooks don't currently work as well as print, but I imagine they'll figure out ways to make them even more convenient in the future.What do y’all think?I’d love to see comments/opinions on any of the following areas:1. Do you think ebooks will ever take over the lion’s share of the reading experience…            A. For fiction?            B. For nonfiction?2. Do ebooks benefit writers or harm them?3. Will ebooks eventually result in more readers or less?4. What are the advantages of…            A. Print over ebooks?            B. Ebooks over print?5. What, if anything, would convince you to buy ebooks over printed novels/books if you don’t currently?6. Any other thoughts on ebooks vs print?I think it will be interesting to see what people think about this.Blue skies,LesP.S. I'm well aware that I'm kind of late to this party. Kazillions and even dozens of blogs have talked about this stuff. But, just curious what you folks think, especially if you've changed your mind about ebooks. Next time, I'll talk about the effect the recent comet had on our dinosaur friends... Is this the end of Tyrannosaurus Rex as we know that lil' guy? Is that new thing they're calling \"the wheel\" going to last or is it just a fad? Other up-to-date, late-breaking news like that..."},
{"title": "INTERVIEW WITH CORTRIGHT MCMEEL, AUTHOR OF \"SHORT\"", "date": "Monday, February 21, 2011", "text": "Hi folks,I’ve got a treat for you today. An interview with Cortright McMeel with his thoughts on writing and on the subject of his first novel, Short, which is burning up the sales charts and is in serious consideration to be made into a flick.“Cort” and I became friends several years ago when he emailed me and asked if I had any stories I could submit to his new noir magazine, Murdaland. I ended up sending him three short stories and he ended up taking all three and combining them into one story, which appeared in the inaugural issue. He titled the story, “Felon.” It was about… well, take a guess… That alone made him my friend… but when he paid me for all three, he became my best friend. More than one editor, under like circumstances, would have claimed that since it became one story, they’d only pay for one, but not Cort. He’s a writer’s editor all the way!Since that day, our friendship has only grown. We began to correspond on a regular basis, and I was fortunate to have him send me an early copy of his novel. It absolutely floored me with its brilliance. In return, over time, I sent him copies of my own novels, and his response to them amazed and gratified me.  He loved them! In fact, he recommended them to both his editor at St. Martin’s and his former editor who is now at Little, Brown.We both share a love of the same books and writers. It’s not a love of “safe” authors at all, but of writers who took chances, challenged the status quo, who wrote the kinds of books that are banned and even vilified by many. You know… real writers with a set of balls (and I mean, men and women). Who are concerned with only one thing. Truth.I am proud to call Cort my friend. I think you’ll soon see his particular brand of genius in the following interview and I hope you’ll glom onto a copy of his wonderful novel, Short.And, without further ado, here’s Cort and me chinnin’…LES: Let’s not beat around the bush. This is a web site about the writing process. What was the biggest challenge for you in writing your debut novel, SHORT?CORT: Without a doubt constructing a tight plot that made sense and moved quickly.LES: In your novel there has to be about a hundred characters, from traders, brokers, executives, lawyers, “beancounters” to strippers, Russian gangsters & sea captains. Did you ever find it overwhelming to fill your novel with such a wide array of characters?CORT: Short answer, no, but my editor did. I like to write on a large canvas. Just sort of let the whole circus run rampant into one big chaotic drunken carnival, as it were. It makes the writing and creating part more fun because there are more options. The characters just interact like so many electrons jammed in a jar bouncing off each other and the potential for humor is greater. LES: You say your editor was overwhelmed. Explain.CORT: Well, John Schoenfelder at St. Martin’s had his work cut out for him. But he’s a brilliant guy and he’s like a master bio-medical engineer who inserted a narrative spine into the book. I helped him some too, of course. But he gave me a “tight plot 101” tutorial which helped immensely.LES: Which was?CORT: He told me to read B. Traven’s GENERAL FROM THE JUNGLE and Castle Friedman’s tight, excellent Swamp Yankee noir called GO WITH ME. I studied those books and busted out outlines of them. Both those books are perfectly plotted. They never veer off-course, the heart of the action propels the book, driving it toward the inevitable finish. LES: I read in The Washington Post review of SHORT that there is a noir element to your book, but when I read it I saw in your hard-drinking, carousing, battling characters more Charles Bukowski than Jim Thompson?CORT: The trading plot may drive the narrative, but I think you make a great point. The spirit of Bukowski definitely looms here. If I was writing about garbage men or ophthalmologists, I’m sure the scurrilous poets and drunken dreamers would come out within the characters of those professions. It’s hard for me to write a book and not have some character who’s howling at the moon and spouting Coleridge or the 7 Principles of BUSHIDO. By that I mean when you write a book, you can’t help but have your spirit infect certain characters. I remember reading somewhere that Dostoyevsky said all three of the Brothers Karamazov were based on different aspects of himself.LES: What about writing characters that your “spirit doesn’t infect”?CORT: I think characters that you are discovering for the first time is like a journalist doing an in-depth interview. They tend be easier to write because there is less danger of going too far. With these characters the writer is less tempted to celebrate or crush them and for me these characters usually come out clean and real. It’s like Yeats said that the artist should “cast a cold eye.” With that cold eye you can fully realize a character’s being. My weakness is that I always like to have at least one or two characters infused with my madness for life.LES: Why is that a weakness? You say Dostoyevsky did it.CORT: First of all, I’m no Fyodor. But I’ll tell you about the weakness. It has an actual name. One of my great friends, Michael Langnas, edited the novel throughout and there were parts where I created certain characters who went off the deep end writing-wise. I was too consumed with their story and their back story and their drunken antics and they were derailing the novel. Langnas called them “Leprechauns.” He came in like the Executioner and just annihilated all these scenes where the Leprechauns were working their evil, drunken magic. It’s good to have a friend like Langnas. He, indeed, possesses Yeats “colder eye.”It was Langnas who when Short was finally done, kindly described it to someone as Bukowski meets Balzac, which I took to mean you get the personal demons and black comedy of personal disintegration you find in Bukow with maybe the wider social arc and look into institutions you find in Balzac. He might’ve just been being nice, but it's a cool thing to at least aspire to.LES: What would you say to a writer writing their first novel? Any words of advice?CORT: Since I can’t seem to shut up about Bukowski, I’d say: First off, read his excellent poem “How to be a Great Writer.” I’ve got that taped to my wall and it helped me through 15 years of rejections. Read that poem and if it doesn’t do it for you, find some set of lines or phrases or something that will cheer you up and make you smile while you type the keys in obscurity wondering if you’re embarking on a fool’s errand. That poem and good friends are what saved me from giving up. My friend, Eddie Vega, ex-marine and a tug boat second mate, as well as an award-winning, published poet and a rum-swilling, cigar-smoking Cuban came to my attic like ten years ago. I was really really down in the dumps. My career right out of Columbia MFA Writing Program in 1996 seemed on its way, I published a story called “Fullback Glory” and it was runner up in the Playboy Fiction Contest. I was riding high and I wrote a novel and then… nothing. I wrote a bunch more short stories, not giving up and like 100’s of rejections followed. Eddie called me and I told him I was going to burn down my library and forget about the whole thing. He came down from New York to Baltimore and said: Cort, look. I’m going to come down and read your shit with you in the room. If your stuff sucks I’ll help you burn down your library. I’ll bring the fucking matches myself.So he came down and I drank tequila and kind of watched him read like ten or twelve stories. It was like five hours so by the end I was pretty drunk. At the end of it he looked up at me and passed me a cigar. Without saying a word he lit mine and lit his. Then he said these words:Mr. McMeel. You have one good story.I was so fucking drunk, and had no faith in myself and was so depressed and deranged that all I remember was laughing hysterically like a madman. I was so deranged that my wife knocked on the door and wondered if everything was okay.LES: And was it? What happened?CORT: The long and short of it was the story Eddie liked called “Mahler’s Ninth” got picked up for publication by Peter Stitt at the Gettysburg Review within four weeks of me sending it.LES: And?CORT: And fuck it. That story was all I needed. I was back, man. LES: And what now?CORT: Well, they tell me you got to worry about sales and reviews and all that stuff. What I worry about is getting down to the honest guts of my next novel like I did with Short. I’m proud of Short, but I know my best is yet to come. And there will be no giving up again, not ever. I’ve thrown away all my matches."},
{"title": "WHY NEWSPAPERS AREN'T DYING: THEY'RE DEAD (Some proof...)", "date": "Thursday, February 10, 2011", "text": "Hi Folks,Sorry it’s been awhile, but had a busy week with my class and my own writing and… to be honest, they come first. I love you guys, but most of you are writers so I know you understand.Anyway, today I was glancing at my local newspaper while in the “reading room” (yeah, you’re right—that room) and trying to figure out why I still pay for the local newspaper. Just about everything I read in it I read a day or two before on the Internet. For in-depth articles the Internet doesn’t give me? Sorry, the majority are the same articles from the same sources. In fact, most of the time I get more depth from the Internet articles—the local paper usually doesn’t run the full articles. Most of the other articles are from The Washington Post so I try to avoid those...The local color? Please. I live in Ft. Wayne. We just had our first national news-worthy story yesterday when it was reported that the city fathers (or is it mothers? Midwives?) were debating if they wanted to name a downtown erection after a former mayor named… ready?... Harry Baals. (You can’t make this stuff up…) Even better, it turns out his first wife’s name was… ready?... Minnie. If I’m lyin’, I’m dyin’…Anyway, it wasn’t any of those items that justify paying for this rag. In fact, I heard about the Harry Baals thing from my friend Tom in Phoenix who read about it while taking a break from watching for illegal aliens who keep ruining his yard by running through it. Tom's from this area originally and burns a candle every day in thanks for not having to shovel snow... (which happens to be the subject of this--it all comes 'round.)I thought perhaps the value of a newspaper might be justified from local writers with their unique take on things. I picked up one of the main sections, the one labeled “Living” and the feature article caught my eye instantly. It had a photo of a woman dressed all in black and wearing a fedora (or, witch’s hat, I’m not sure…) shoveling a mound of snow and on the shovel’s handle she had tied what looked like a pillow case to look like a flag of surrender. Not sure what that was all about—it looked like it was there in case she fell into a snowdrift and could perhaps hoist it as a distress signal.The headline read: “If you can’t beat it, use it.” It was about… snow. Hey, good stuff, I figured. We’ve been dumped on for the past week or so and about all we do is shovel it ad nauseum.Her essay question and theme was: “So what do you do with all that snow?” Well, personally, I hadn’t thought much about it. Having a somewhat limited imagination inasfar as piles of snow go—look at it when you’re forced to and hope it goes away—is about the extent of any thought I’d given the subject, but by golly, this person had actually come up with some uses for the stuff. She even got a byline for the article and it was on the front page of the section, so I assumed this would be some pretty scintillating stuff. Kind of thing you’re not likely to get on the Internet and probably why I keep shelling out bucks for this rag.So, I read on. Her illuminating first answer to her own question was: “Sure, you could wait for it to melt, but what fun would that be?” Well, she had me there. That had been about all I’d ever come up with on the (very) few times I’d considered the question.Now, I was excited! This intrepid reporter had actual uses for the piles of snow that were everywhere. Fun things. At least, that was the implication… By golly, maybe I’d underestimated the content of newspapers. At this point, I was ready to pick up the phone and renew my subscription for another three years. But… something told me to read further. Be cautious.Her first fun suggestion:Make some yard art. (Her words, not mine.)Now that your lawn ornaments and multi-colored, solar-powered mushrooms are underneath a large blanket of snow, you can make some new ones. Be creative. You could make a deer, or some other woodland creature, or how about an army of mini-snowmen to protect your fortress?When I read her first fun-filled activity suggestion, I began to suspect it was a good thing that I hadn’t renewed that subscription just yet. First, we don’t have any lawn ornaments except for that politically-incorrect statue they’re always circulating petitions in the 'hood about, and I’m not quite sure what “solar-powered mushrooms” are, and I’m reasonably sure we don’t have any, covered by snow or not. Is that an Al Gore thing? It’s minus 7 degrees outside with the wind chill, so crawling around in snowdrifts sculpting deer or other “woodland creatures” (whatever those are… skunks and feral cats?) doesn’t really match up with other potential activities that might rival that for fun… such as watching a basketball game in a warmer place with a brew in hand. How long does it take to sculpt a deer (and what do you use? your hands? a chain saw?) or a woodland creature? Even a skunk would take some modicum of skill, especially from fingers numb from frostbite. I’m afraid I’d be exhausted just doing the deer and don’t know if I could last long enough to mold an “army of mini-snowmen.” How many are in an army, anyway? Fifty? Two hundred? Even a couple of hundred doesn’t sound like much of an army—sounds more like the local PTA meeting. And, I don’t really see my house as a “fortress” to be honest. It’s more like a… house. That’s about to get repossessed. Maybe I do need an army of mini-snowmen. To help me fight off the bank and the guy who’s trying to repo my car. The more I think about it, that army of mini-snowmen sounds like a good idea. Give ‘em M-16s. Wait. Those are outlawed now, aren’t they? Well, are pea shooters still legal? This is gonna be some sorry army…Her second suggestion:A natural outdoor freezer.Take some of your frozen goods and set them outside to be kept cold by nature. Cold beer, anyone? What better way to chill a brewski or pop than  than shoving it in the snow. Just be careful that you don’t set something outside that can attract wildlife.I wish I could make stuff like this up! On the surface, this sounds doable. It’s for sure cold enough to use “nature’s refrigerator.” On the other hand, with unemployment over 10% for this area, I’m not too sure I should be sticking foodstuffs outside. I can see the lines already—this would look like the food pantry the Salvation Army runs for the indigenous. Although, I suspect the teenagers on the block will be ecstatic if I start sticking my brewskies outside. Maybe that’s what she means about not putting something out that can attract “wildlife.” Are teenagers considered wildlife? Perhaps so… I’m going to have to think more about the brewski thing as well. How long does it take beer to freeze solid at 7 below? Another drawback to this—I’d have to go outside in this stuff both to stick it in the snow and then retrieve it. Maybe I could time it for halftime.Third fun activity:Save on water usage.Melt snow and use it for things around the house that may take a lot of water, such as flushing the toilet, watering the plants, cleaning, etc. On average, about 10 inches of snow is equal to one inch of water.Or, the way I figure it, one sculpted deer equals one flushing of the stool. Or, six and a half mini-snowmen from my army. (Or, “white and yellow infantrymen” as I refer to them… we have a lot of dogs on our block) Is it just me, or does it sound as if you need to haul an awful lot of snow in for a tiny bit of water? And, where do you put all this snow when you’re melting it? For a bath, I figure I’ll need to fill up the spare bedroom. And then, how do you warm it to bath temperature? Also, if you’re using this much snow, aren’t you going to be exposing your “solar-powered mushrooms?” Is that wise? I need to call her up and ask her if these are legal mushrooms or the kind we used to call “schrooms” and paid a lot of money for and threw out the window when the cop car red light went on...Next up…Help for ouchies. (I swear I wish I could make this stuff up!)Fill a plastic sandwich bag with snow, zip it up and use it as a homemade ice pack. Great for injuries, icing down knees or for headaches.Mary! Make me a sandwich bag snow pack! I have a raging headache! Make one for yourself, too, for later on when we go to bed and I want to get frisky. My knees are pretty banged up as well, from crawling around outside in the snow, sculpting woodland creatures, but I can’t stop shivering so maybe a sandwich ice pack isn’t what I really want to be holding on them right now…Are you ready? Hold on. Here’s the next one:Wax remover.Use some snow on freshly spilled candle wax. Freezing wax can help get it out of carpets or off tablecloths easier.I don’t know about you, but I’m having more fun just thinking about all these fun activities than I’ve had in months. Why is there “freshly-spilled candle wax” on the carpet anyway? Oh… yeah. From the six hundred candles we had to light to help warm the house from the spare bedroom full of my developing bath water…You’d think the quality of these suggestions would begin to flag, but you’d be wrong.Eat it. (The reporter’s words, not mine. I’m too polite to say something like this to you.)Grab some clean snow (the cleanest you can find) and make some ice cream. A simple recipe includes getting 1 gallon of snow, one (14-ounce) can of sweetened condensed milk and 1 teaspoon of vanilla extract. Mix the ingredients together and eat up.This really works and is fun to do! I made lemon ice cream! Mary’s calling a lawyer—I wonder why. She only had a spoonful and then I revealed the recipe. The dog liked it. He even took his bowl and made it even more lemony… I confess I'm a bit worried about the cleanliness of this snow. Don't we have an acid rain thing going on?Two more to go. You guys taking notes?Make snow cones.Get an ice cream scooper and scoop up some snow into a bowl. Use juice, Kool-Aid or flavored drinks and pour on top. Grab a spoon or just dig in face first.I have a tip. I just used some more of that yellow snow I used for the ice cream for this. And, I ended up “digging in face first” as per our intrepid reporter’s advice, but it wasn’t exactly my choice. Mary kind of did that for me. That hurt, Mary! Well, she’s gone. Up to bed with her sandwich bag ice pack. Looks like I might have to use the spare bedroom tonight. Oh, wait! My bath water’s only about half finished making.And the last one.Snowballs.Make some snowballs and freeze them for later for the ultimate summer snowball fight. They’ll never know what hit ‘em. Now that’s using the snow.At last! A fun activity I already know how to do! I have a twist on mine, though. I put rocks in them. Just imagine my neighbor’s surprise when he gets whapped up alongside the head in July with one of these puppies! Some fun!Well, I’ve completely changed my mind on the value of newspapers. I’m calling the delivery lady up right now and renewing my subscription for the next ten years. You can’t get this kind of article on the Internet, no way! Well, I would call her but I can’t find my phone. I think it’s in the spare bedroom at the bottom of my bath.First thing tomorrow though. Right now, I’m going to go out and see what those teenagers are doing in my yard. They better not be after my brewskies in “nature’s fridge.” I might have to break out my snowballs early.If you’re interested in getting a copy, this was in today’s (Thursday’s) Ft. Wayne Journal-Gazette. I’m sure they’ll appreciate the publicity and extra sales. For some reason, I’ve heard receipts were kind of down… It’s just heart-warming to know our journalism schools are still turning out outstanding reporters and editors. Not to mention Ft. Wayne is keeping up the standards of the town. This is the place that gave the world the “Potato Chip Lady” for those of you old enough to remember her. She worked at a potato chip factory here in town for years and collected chips off the line that looked like famous people. True story. Johnny Carson heard of her and flew her out to his show. Had to pay for two tickets, because she had to have a seat for her favorite chip, who was a lookalike for (I think) Richard Millhouse Nixon. While on the show, she was pointing out all the famous people her chips looked like and Johnny reached over and grabbed Tricky Dicky and ate him! It was hilarious. I understand she had a bit of a mental breakdown because of the trauma, but she recovered. Not sure Ft. Wayne has…I wonder if she had a chip that looked like Harry Baals… I'd like to see that one.I hope my mini-snowmen army look threatening enough if the locals read this and head back down with their pitchforks and torches again…Y’all come back, heah?Blue skies,Les"},
{"title": "TALKING ABOUT THE NOVEL YOU'RE WORKING ON", "date": "Sunday, January 30, 2011", "text": "Hi folks!Sometimes, the obvious is so much in plain sight—right in front of our eyes, so close that we can reach out and touch it—that we fail to see it. That’s happened to me more times than I can count, and I’ll bet it’s happened to you as well.One of those times this happened to me was the day I realized I was “talking” my novel and not writing it. It happened when I was sick with the flu and had to take a couple of days off work. Best illness I ever had!At the time, I was a hair designer. Had a very successful salon called “Bold Strokes” that my wife Mary and I owned. We were booked solid weeks in advance. Each day, I saw an average of fifteen clients. I was writing at the time and it was a topic of conversation with just about every person who sat in my chair. I loved talking about my writing and they at least claimed they loved hearing about it.“What’re you working on now, Les?” was a familiar question. Or, “How’s the novel going? What’s happened since the last time (she was in)?”And, off I’d go. I’d regale my captive audience with what my characters were doing, what I planned to have them do. Watch their faces as I described the twist I was planning. Seeing their surprise and hearing their words of praise just felt good. Better than being hit in the eye with a short stick, anyway.And discovered that more and more, my daily output was diminishing. And not by a little. By a lot.I thought maybe it was all over. That the well had run dry. That it was probably a good thing that I had a trade and was good at it.Actually, I’m glossing over what I actually felt. What I actually felt was… suicidal. If I couldn’t write any longer, what was the point? It was my life—the important part, anyway. My wife sensed my despair and began cutting up my meat before she served it and hid all the sharp instruments.And, then, I got sick. Really sick, hurling chunks sick.Had to go home. For two days.Best thing that ever happened to me.Why?Well, because during that first midmorning, I felt good enough to get up and sit down in front of my typewriter. (For those of you too young to remember, a “typewriter” was a medieval machine used to create letters and stuff like that. Novels. Kidnap notes. It looked something like a computer keyboard does, but without the screen and the Internet. No porn available with it. If you ever get to a museum, chances are they’ll have one on display back with the arrowheads from the Nez Pierce. Look at it carefully and try to imagine writing on something without a Delete key… Now you know why it’s okay to laugh whenever somebody talks about the “good old days.”)For months before my illness, I’d struggle mightily to write a page or two of my novel each night. This particular morning, I ripped off ten pages before I even had my first cup of coffee. Ended up with over twenty pages for the day. The next day, I did even better. Wrote almost thirty pages. For you non-writers, that’s a lot. Got fifty pages written in two days! I was back! I was a writer again!I went back to work the next day and couldn’t wait to get back to my typewriter at the end of the day. And didn’t end up with as much as a single page, even though I’d sat in front of it for over two hours. Two stinkin’ paragraphs. Lousy paragraphs that I would have crumpled up and thrown away if it wasn’t all I had to show for my time.WTF! (Translated, that means, “What the heck!”)What was happening? Were the previous two days some kind of evil trick God was playing on me? Had those two Jehovah Witnesses who had stopped by placed a curse on me for telling them I believed in reincarnation and was coming back as Cheryl Tiegs' favorite bra? (I’m dating myself here, aren’t I…)I have to tell you I honestly felt despair. It was like watching someone going crazy and then realizing you were looking into a mirror.What’d I do? What any intelligent person does when they face a problem of this magnitude. I went home and opened a bottle of Jack and began knocking it back. What? You thought I was going to say I went to church and a minister talked to me and I had my “come to Jesus” moment? Nah… Just cracked open some Jack and tried to think. For those who say alcohol never solves any problems, well… all I can say is he’s never been to my church and heard my preacher…It probably wasn’t the Jack, to be honest, but I did some serious thinking and realized something. What was different about the days off. The difference was I hadn’t talked about my novel to a single person.That was it! I had my eureka moment. (Thank you, Mr. Daniels…) The lightbulb went off and I saw clearly what my almost nonexistent writing output was all about.I was talking it all out before I got to the typewriter. I’d actually been “writing” all day when I was regaling my clients. By the time I got home in the evening, I’d already been “writing” for 12 hours. There was just nothing left. I was simply spent by the time I got home.Do you supposed I quit talking to my clients about whatever I was working on and began to produce prodigious quantities of pages nightly? Well, as a matter of fact, I did. That’s exactly what happened. And I haven’t stopped. I mean, jeez, I’m not the smartest guy in the world, but this was pretty obvious, even to me.Like I said at the beginning of this—sometimes the obvious is in plain sight. Once you see it, it’s probably a good idea not to forget it. And I haven’t. These days, I don’t talk much about whatever I’m working on at all. I may talk about something I’ve already written, but there’s no way I’m going to talk to anyone about the work I’m planning on doing. I do that and it’s already written. Only it’s not yet on paper. I don’t see any advantage in that at all.I don’t even tell my wife Mary what I’m working on any more. To her credit (or perhaps good sense or good taste), she doesn’t ask or care. She knows she’ll get to read it once it’s published. That’s good enough for her. I’m not even sure she reads it then, although she’s got the good grace to pay for her own copy and I can’t ask for more than that.If you find yourself at the coffee shop or at work or wherever and talking to friends about what you’re working on, ask yourself if you’re not doing what I did—writing it before you get to your typewriter. Although… you probably have a computer…If you think you are, there’s a simple solution.Quit doing that.The fee for this priceless information should you feel morally obligated to remit it is the price of a bottle of Jack.Next week, I’ll talk about how laying on the couch and staring into space is the writer working. This one will be aimed at spouses…Blue skies,me Talking philosophy here, not novels... Seriously..."},

{"title": "A bit of my own writing...", "date": "Thursday, January 13, 2011", "text": "Hi folks,Thought I’d post some writing stuff today. The following is an excerpt from one of the two memoirs I’m working on. It covers about a three-year period and is focused on the baseball adventures my son Mike and I enjoyed. These were some of the best years of my life.Hope you like it!FOUR-SEAM GRIP(From an as-yet unpublished memoir, working title: MIKE AND ME)            I look out over the ball diamond at the Country Estates Mobile Home Park at the six boys lined up on the third-base line and another row of six along the first-to-second basepath as they toss baseballs to their partners and I see another ballfield in my past. A diamond nestled in the corner of the recreation yard at Pendleton Reformatory, eighty-seven miles south of where I am today. And thirty years in the distance.            I'd been required to take a 2-5 year timeout from life for various crimes against society, mostly burglaries. Eighty-two of them, to be precise. Eighty-two second-degree burglaries were the \"official\" ones, the ones the authorities were aware of. There were possibly more…            There are no fourteen-foot-thick gray walls around this field. Just the mobile homes behind us, a community center to our right and a woods where left and center field end. Beyond right field is the access road to the park, which leads in from the highway.            The bubble-gum-chewing eleven- and twelve-year-olds hurling the horsehide before me on this day are the members of my Wallen youth baseball team. I am their coach. We're an AABC team. This is my first year at Wallen. For the past five years I coached in Little League at St. Joe, over in the northeast part of town where I lived. None of these boys know my past, nor do their parents. If they did, I'd be their ex-coach, I think. I'm pretty sure at least some of the moms and dads would be demanding my resignation should they learn I served two years in prison for burglary once upon a time.            Although, one boy does know. My son, Mike. He's the tall one on the end, throwing lasers to the tough little guy who usually catches him in games, Steve Tipton, the son of my assistant coach, Steve, Sr. I know I can trust Mike not to divulge the information he has about his dad to his teammates. I can trust Mike with anything. We're best friends and we talked about his father's past a long time ago in one of our nightly \"guy talks\" we have each evening just before he shuts his eyes and drifts off to sleep. It's our secret. We have a couple-three secrets, us two guys.            Sometimes, after he falls asleep, I sit on the edge of his bed and simply stare at him. Sometimes, we hold hands as we talk and he falls asleep that way. I don't want to take my hand away, so I'll sit there until his unclenches and then I'll leave. Not before I bend over and kiss his slightly damp forehead, the sweet smell of his little-boy hair filling my nostrils. And my heart.            \"Four-seam grips!\" I shout at my team. \"Remember. Always four-seam grips.\"            Our first drill at each practice begins the same. We warm up in these lines and work on our receiving and throwing mechanics. Once they're warmed up, we'll hold the competition they're all waiting for. Keep extending the distance between the lines until there's only one pair left who haven't dropped the ball or underthrown it.They know to be in an athletic, \"linebacker\" position, glove extended, knees, waist and elbows bent, withdraw the glove slightly as the ball arrives. Use both hands to catch the ball. Get the ball out of the glove fast, get the four-seam grip and pivot, glove extended in front, throwing arm back, knees bent, fingers on top of the ball, hand slightly above the shoulder. The wrist is also bent. Every possible joint on the body is bent except the neck and the neck is turned toward the left if the thrower is right-handed, to the right if he's a southpaw. Bring the glove hand to your heart as you pivot toward your target and throw.            Give a good target, I say. I say this quite often. Hands up. Chest-high. Get the ball out quick.            Expect a bad throw, I repeat.            This is like life, I tell them, my attempt to weave a bit of philosophy into what we're doing. Give folks a good target and expect a bad throw. Be happy when you get a good throw and prepared if you don't.            How do you catch the ball? I ask.            With your feet, they yell out, in unison. Move to the ball. Don't \"arm\" it. They're well-rehearsed. Good kids, these. They pay attention.            Coach Steve and I stop the kids occasionally and walk up and down the lines, checking on their grips. I'm a preacher and the four-seam grip is my sermon topic.            I quiz 'em.            \"Why do we always want to use a four-seam grip?\" I want to know.            By this, the second week of practice, twelve hands shoot up. They all know by now.            \"Because,\" says the other Mike on our team, diminutive Mike Rish, when I point to him. His dad sponsors the team. Rish Construction. \"If you use another grip, the ball may sail or curve or sink.\" It's important Rish knows this. He's going to be our second baseman. I don't think \"sail\" was a word in his vocabulary before joining this team, but it is now. Probably \"sink\" wasn't either, at least not in this context. Mike Rish wants to be a pitcher - ten of the twelve players on this team do - so curve was a word familiar to him. They all want to throw curves but we don't let 'em. They throw 'em anyway.            You can only do so much and then you have to realize they have minds of their own.            I point to another boy who still waves his hand frantically. He has knowledge to share. They all have the same knowledge, but Ian Tipton is anxious to show his coach he's been paying attention. Coach Tipton and I have Ian slotted for third base and maybe do some catching. He's a hard-nosed kid, lives here in the trailer park. It's Jeff, his dad, who arranged for us to use their field for practice. Ian is Coach Steve's nephew. Jeff helps us coach.            \"The ball may slip and you'll get a wild throw,\" Ian says, in a voice that's already changing, hitting those high and low tones during the same sentence, sometimes in the same word. \"You gotta use the seams.\" Ian knows this now, but during the season, during a bang-bang play, he'll forget. I'll get ticked off for a second and then remember he's only twelve. I'm in my fifties and I forget lots more than that and most times my own memory lapses don't come during the pressure of bang-bang plays.            Bang-bang plays are kind of what got me into trouble all those years back. I was kind of a bang-bang guy. Guy with a million-dollar arm and a ten-cent head, kind of like the character Ebby Calvin (Nuke) LaLoosh in the movie Bull Durham…but with more serious consequences than Nuke suffered. Instead of nearly getting cut from a baseball team, I ended up close to getting cut by life. Like Nuke, I got lucky and was able to make a comeback.            To a large degree because of that kid out there.                     \"Four-seam grips!\" I yell out at the boys.            It's my mantra. Mike playing first base at a Perfect Game Showcase when he was a freshman. And, here he is for his eighth-grade basketball team.Here, Mike's pitching for his Snider H.S. team. Not baseball! Mike's sitting on his Uncle Neil's bike and begging him to give the bike to him!And last... Mike and I getting our \"makeup\" before our appearance (twice!) on MSNBC-News for the book we co-authored, a spoof on Little League baseball titled \"Surviving Little League.\"Which is this book. We had a wonderful time writing it together and the best thing was we got to go on TV and were also interviewed on over 40 radio shows from all over the country from Pittsburgh to San Francisco. Best experience of my life was writing this book with Mike (it was his idea) and appearing on all the shows. (He was 12 when we wrote it.)"},

She just called me a few minutes ago to give me the weather report. She's 88, so I get almost daily weather reports. She doesn't realize there's an invention called \"television\" that also reports on the weather fairly regularly. I don't tell her because what else would we talk about? Electricity?Even though South Bend is only an hour north of us here in Ft. Wayne, they get an entirely different kind of weather. Lying just south of Lake Michigan, they get the full brunt of the \"lake effect\" where snow comes over Lake Michigan from Canada and waits until the snow clouds sight land and then dumps it. On South Bend and the general area from Michigan City over. By the time the clouds reach Ft. Wayne, they're pretty much depleted and that's the way I like it.She had a great report today. She said they already had 24 inches of snow and it was still snowing and was supposed to all day. It made me feel so good! Why? Because we had half an inch and it's pretty well melted off...I laughed so hard at her news that I had to hang up. I called her back and gave her one of those \"little white lies\" you give your mother. I told her there was this hysterically funny show on TV that I was watching and that's why I broke up laughing. She asked me what a TV was and I had to explain that and then  we hung up. I await an update tomorrow.Did I mention I hate snow? I didn't see any until I was 12 years old, growing up in Freeport, Texas which isn't noted much for its blizzards. Once I saw some, I was over it. Never wanted to see any ever again. In fact, I don't like that \"changing of the seasons\" people go fruity over. In my perfect world, it would always be 95 degrees with 100% humidity for 364 days of the year. On one day a year, we would have winter, which would be a day when the temp went down to 75 and the tips of the palm tree fronds would turn brown. But, for only one day!A few minutes after talking to Mom, I received an email from some good friends of mine, John and Angie Felabom, and they sent me the following. I wish I knew the author so I could give him or her proper credit and if I find out who it was, I'll include it. John and Angie live in South Bend, so they were experiencing the same weather as Mom.I wish them the best...              Diary   of a Demented INDIANA-ER     December 8 - 6:00 PM It started to snow. The first   snow of the season andthe wife and I took our cocktails and sat for hours bythe window watching the huge soft flakes drift down from heaven. It looked like a Grandma Moses print. So romantic we felt like newlyweds again. I love snow! December 9   We woke to a beautiful   blanket of crystal white snowcovering every inch of the landscape. What a fantasticsight! Can there be a more lovely place in the whole world?Moving here was the best idea   I've ever had! Shoveled for the first time in years and felt like aboy again. I did both our driveway and the sidewalks.This afternoon the snowplow came along and covered up the sidewalks and closed in the driveway, so I got to shovel again. What a perfect life!December 12 The sun has melted all   our lovely snow. Such adisappointment! My neighbor tells me not to worry-we'll definitely have a white Christmas.  No snow on Christmas   would be awful! Bob says we'll have so much snow by the end of winter, that I'll never want to seesnow again. I don't think that's possible. Bob is sucha nice man, I'm glad he's our neighbor. December 14Snow, lovely snow! 8   inches last night. The temperature dropped to -20.  The   cold makes everything sparkle so. The wind took my breath away,   but I warmed up byshoveling the driveway and   sidewalks. This is the life!  The snowplow came back this   afternoon and buried everything again. I didn't   realize I would have to do quite this much shoveling,   but I'll certainly get back inshape this way. I wish I   wouldn't huff and puff so. December 1520 inches forecast. Sold my van and bought a 4x4Blazer. Bought snow tires for the wife's car and 2extra shovels. Stocked the freezer. The wife wants a wood stove in case the electricity goes out. I think that's silly. We aren't in Alaska,   after all. December 16 Ice storm this   morning. Fell on my ass on the ice inthe driveway putting down salt. Hurt like hell. Thewife laughed for an hour, which I think was very cruel. December 17 Still below   freezing. Roads are too icy to goanywhere. Electricity was off for 5 hours. I had topile the blankets on to stay warm. Nothing to do but stare at the wife and try not to irritate her. Guess I should've bought a wood stove, but won't admit it toher. God I hate it when she's right. I can't believeI'm freezing to death in my own living room. December 20 Electricity is back   on, but had another 14 inches ofthe damn stuff last night. More shoveling! Took allday. The damn snowplow came by twice. Tried to find a neighbor kid to   shovel, but they said they're too busy playing hockey. I think they'relying. Called the only hardware store around to see aboutbuying a snow blower and they're out. Might have another shipment in March. I think they're lying. Bob says I have to shovel or the city will have it doneand bill me. I think he's lying. December 22 Bob was right about a white Christmas because 13 moreinches of the white shit fell today, and it's so cold,it probably won't melt till August. Took me 45 minutes to get all dressed up to go out to shovel and then Ihad to piss. By the time I got undressed, pissed anddressed again. I was too tired to shovel. Tried tohire Bob who has a plow on his truck for the rest of the winter, but he says he's too busy. I think theasshole is lying. December 23 Only 2 inches of snow   today. And it warmed up to 0.The wife wanted me to decorate the front of the housethis morning. What is she, nuts?!! Why didn't she tell me to do that a month ago? She says she did but I think she's lying. December 24 6 inches - Snow packed   so hard by snowplow, I broke the shovel. Thought I   was having a heart attack. If I ever catch the son of a   bitch who drives that snow plow, I'll drag him through the snow by his balls and beat him to death with my broken shovel. I know hehides around the corner and waits for me to finishshoveling and then he comes down the street at a 100 miles an hour and throws snow all over where I've just been! Tonight the wife wanted me to sing Christmascarols with her and open our presents, but I was toobusy watching for the damn snowplow. December 25 Merry Christmas!   20 more inches of the damn slop tonight - Snowed   in. The idea of shoveling makes my blood boil. God, I   hate the snow! Then the snowplow driver came by asking for a donation and I hit him over the head with my shovel. The wife says I have a bad attitude. I think she's a  frickingidiot. If I have to watch \"It's   A Wonderful Life\" onemore time, I'm going to stuff her into the microwave. December 26 Still snowed in. Why the hell did I ever move here? It was all HER idea. She's   really getting on my nerves. December 27 Temperature dropped to -30   and the pipes froze;plumber came after 14 hours of waiting for him, heonly charged me $1,400 to replace all my pipes. December 28 Warmed up to above -20. Still   snowed in. The BITCH isdriving me crazy!!! December 29Snowed again. Bob says   I have to shovel the roof orit could cave in. That's the silliest thing I ever heard. How dumb does he think I am?December 30 Roof caved in. I beat   up the snow plow driver, and nowhe is suing me for a million dollars, not only for thebeating I gave him, but also for trying to shove the broken snow shovel up his ass. The   wife went home to her mother.Nine more inches predicted. December 31 I set fire to what's left of the house. No moreshoveling. January 8 Feel so good. I just   love those little white pillsthey keep giving me. Why am I tied to the bed?   South Bend just after they dug out from the last snow...Perfect weather and the perfect Christmas tree!"},
{"title": "Cort McMeel and his novel SHORT", "date": "Monday, January 3, 2011", "text": "Hi Folks,A bit of a departure--I want to give a shout-out to my writer buddy, Cort McMeel and his just-released novel, Short, which is climbing up the bestseller lists and deservedly so.Cort just emailed me to tell me he'd just given me a shout-out in an interview with Jenny Shank he just did for New West and I wanted to share it with you. In it, he said in part:Western WritersAn Interview with Cortright McMeel \"Short\" is a funny, talented debut novel by a Denver's Cortright McMeel.By Jenny Shank, 1-03-11                                                                Cortright McMeel, photographed by Sam Holden.      Denver’s Cortright McMeel works for Rainbow Energy, teaches at the Lighthouse Writers Workshop, founded Murdaland,  a crime fiction literary magazine, and writes accomplished short  stories and novels.  His thirteen years of experience as an energy  trader provided the source material for Short  (Thomas Dunne Books, 304 pages, $24.99), a talented and funny debut  novel of duplicitous and morally bankrupt traders and brokers.  In Jess  Walter’s review of Short for The Washington Post,  he noted that McMeel “revels in juicy descriptions and office  anecdotes, which have the unmistakable feel of insider lore.”  I  recently interviewed McMeel via email about Short.  We discussed  why he originally thought of his novel as a “trader Western,” another  novel he’s working on about Doc Holliday, and his trademark “Dad who has  two kids under six writing technique.”  Cortright McMeel will discuss Short at the Tattered Cover (Colfax) on Wednesday, January 5 at 7:30 p.m.  New West: What brought you to Denver? Cortright McMeel: My wife has always wanted to live here near  the mountains so we could ski more. I got a look at an energy trading  firm out here three years ago and we took the shot. It’s been excellent,  especially for the kids, and we’ve never looked back. NW: Your first novel, Short is set mainly on the east coast—have you set anything you’ve written in Colorado? CM: As soon as I arrived, I found out that Doc Holliday died in  Glenwood Springs. I took a trip to visit his grave. Ever since I have  been doing research on a novel about his final stint in Leadville. One  chapter is written, and the project is one that is very personal to me  and one that I am excited about. NW: You earned an MFA at Columbia before entering the fields of  advertising and then trading.  Was it always your plan to study writing,  and then find a job that it was easier to make a living at afterward? CM:  “Plan” is a strong word to apply to anything I do. I was  going to go to the Marines but this woman I was in love with (my now  wife) was going to be in New York City. I lucked out and got into  Columbia. After Columbia I was too lazy to be a waiter and had too  flimsy a grasp of the truth to be a journalist. Advertising was the  perfect fit. NW: Tell me about Murdaland, the crime fiction literary magazine you founded.  How did that come about? CM: Murdaland is something I’m very proud of. This is the  only good idea I ever came up with while sitting at a bar. I was on a  crime fiction kick, reading Jim Thompson, [Georges] Simenon, and George  V. Higgins’ The Friends of Eddie Coyle, and I was like, “Man,  this stuff is literature!” I’d had three failed, rejected novels, and I  thought “Well, if I can’t be a writer, I love literature in general, and  so I’ll be a publisher.” I wasn’t rich from trading but I had a few  pennies to rub together to fund a modest literary magazine. The idea I  had was I wanted a dark crime magazine with literary sensibilities. I  wanted Jim Thompson and David Goodis versus bestseller type stuff.  Discovering American Dostoyevskys was the experiment. We were fortunate  enough to get some incredible talent like Daniel Woodrell, Mary  Gaitskill, Jayne Ann Phillips, Tom Franklin and Richard Bausch, as well  as a David Goodis classic reprint and some amazing fresh talent,  especially standouts like Les Edgerton, who is about to break big in  2011. That first issue was something special. After the second issue we  shut it down but just the two issues were enough for Murdaland to garner respect, an award or two, and a small, but hardcore, following. NW: Your author photo is great, with you staring intensely forward as you holding a copy of Fat City by Leonard Gardner and The Sun Also Rises by Hemingway– did you do that to show that those books are your influences? CM: The photo with the books was totally a happenstance. Being a  book nerd, I’m always carrying books around, more than one. I happened  to have those two books on me and the photographer created that photo. I  was worried it would seem pretentious or something. But it came out  great. In real life I look like Shrek. (Aside: Yes, both those books are  huge influences for me.) NW: How did the idea for Short come to you?  Did it start with characters or a plot idea? CM: It came while reading Ian Flemming’s Goldfinger, a spy  novel about a bad guy trying to corner another commodity market…gold. I  was like…I could do this but with electricity trading. For the rest of the (fascinating!) interview, go to:   http://www.newwest.net/topic/article/an_interview_with_cortright_mcmeel/C39/L39/This is where Cort and I first met (Murdaland). I still don't know how he found about me, but he contacted me when putting together the first issue, and asked if I had any short stories I could send him for consideration. Well, I didn't--I quit writing short stories years ago (no money in 'em), but I cannibalized a part of a novel I hadn't sent out. Cort loved it and asked if I had anything else. I ended up sending him two more cannibalizations of other novels and he ended up taking all three. Not only that, he paid me for all three, even though he combined them into one story. Now... that's a nice guy in my book! An editor who pays more than he has to!Ever since then, our friendship has broadened and deepened and he's become my chief advocate with publishers on behalf of my work. We also have a mutual dream. Cort wants to found a literary press and he asked me a long time ago for a novel for it when he launches it and if it happens, I'd be honored beyond belief to have him as my publisher and editor. He's simply brilliant.Cort also received a wonderful review for Short in the Washington Post you can check out at: http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/12/27/AR2010122704135.htmlAnd, then there's the review on Short I wrote for Amazon which is on a post a week or so ago here. It's just an amazing novel and Cort is destined to become a major novelist. I just want to do my part in helping him get the attention he deserves. Hope you folks get his novel and like it as much as I did. He's going to give me an interview for the blog as soon as his life settles down a bit. He's doing readings and signings all over the place right now. In fact, I think this week  he'll be doing a signing at the famous Tattered Cover Bookstore in Denver on Wednesday, January 5. If any of y'all are in the area, don't miss it! If you go, tell him \"I sentcha.\"Blue skies,Les"},

{"title": "A Father's Love", "date": "Monday, December 27, 2010", "text": "Hi folks,I recently received an email from a good friend of mine who’s a fantastic writer and thought what he communicated to me and a few close friends would be the perfect thing to post during the holiday season as a true-life example of something truly wondrous.As writers, we have many reasons why we write and why we desire publication. One of the most universal reasons I think, is that many of us want to make our parents proud of us. For more than one writer, it was our parents’ support—both financial and emotional—that support undoubtedly provided the impetus to stay the course, plugging through the trials and setbacks we all experience as writers. In my own case, that wasn’t the environment—my father made it clear he thought anyone who wrote or read books was pretty much a sissy, and my mother is a religious fanatic who believed the only book a writer should write should be to the “glory of God.” My latest novel my agent is shopping, titled The Bitch, probably won’t fit her idea of a worthy book, but that’s all right. She’s never read any of my books and this one won’t be any different.Nevertheless, I am envious of those who have parents who do support their life choices and the following is something I can’t have for myself, but wish I could.I asked my friend if I could post this and he said it was truly private but that if I wanted to, he didn’t mind so long as I kept his identity secret, which I readily agreed to. It was just such a heartwarming story that I thought it might move others the way it moved me. He’s just a lucky guy as you’ll see.Here’s what he said:”…as for the blog..I’m flattered you would use this... but my old man is kind of a private dude. If you want to use it and keep the names anonymous that’s totally cool... just as a guy of yesteryear, I know my old man prefers to keep under the radar...but YES… as a tale of inspiration, feel free to mention it...”And, here’s how he prefaced what his dad said: “I wanted to pass this along to a few close lifelong friends. It’s the speech my father gave at a small dinner of the National Arts Club for the book launch. It’s an understated short speech with much gravitas & sense of the past and the kind only my dad is capable of giving. I want to thank you all for in one way or another for your friendship. This is the best I can do, plagarizing another's words.”      May we all arrive at Isfahan in   style,Your friend_______His father’s words:Your   literary debut at the National Arts Club was an iconic event for Mom and me. It   represented the culmination of years of work, perseverance, tenacity and   focus. For every person that says, ”I’m going to write a book,” you are the   one in a thousand who actually achieved that goal.To me, the   book launching was like a caravan from China via the long arduous Silk Road trek   through deserts, mountains, and SOB-infested tribal areas finally arriving at   the caravanserai in Isfahan in central Persia(Iran). It was a sophisticated   city even in the 12th century, having as its most notable building   the Blue Mosque, one of the largest and most beautiful in Islam.To those   in a caravan it must have created feelings of both accomplishment and relief,   arriving where they could sell their goods to traders who would then take   their caravans to the Mediterranean coast for sale.The   trading area in Isfahan, still present today, is a rectangular area about 100   yards wide and 200 yards long. It was in this area that the merchants from   China sold their wares to the merchants buying them and taking them to sell   in the west.Son, you   have made it to Isfahan in style, and I know the rest of your journey be an   even greater success.DadShort message, but man, I wish my   own father would have said something like that to me! Isn’t he a lucky guy?I just think this fits the spirit   of the times. I suspect that long after his book fades from the bestseller   lists and he’s off onto another novel, these words will burn in his memory as   bright as the day he heard his father utter them.Hope you found this as uplifting   as I did.BTW, I ran this by my friend to be   sure it met with his approval and didn’t give his identity away and this is   how he replied:Les,   hey that’s really cool, man… hope my pop’s short speech provides some   inspiration to folks on that literary caravan & any caravan, any journey...Blue skies,LesBTW, Writer’s Digest is calling   for nominations for its 2011-101 Best Websites for Writers.

{"title": "MORE STUDENT WORK WITH COMMENTS/EXCHANGES", "date": "Monday, December 13, 2010", "text": "Hi folks,I thought I’d show again exchanges with one of my students on the novel she’s writing in our class. Not only is she a terrific writer, but she has a powerful story to tell and it’s one I feel confident is going to be published when finished. She’s been one of the best students I’ve ever had and I can’t wait until she’s finished to be able to introduce her to my agent and get this puppy on the shelves of B&N and Border’s. Most of us experience the same problems in our own writing, so I hope this might prove of value to at least a few of you.What follows are some of the recent exchanges we went through for her novel over the last two weeks. My comments are in bold and hers in regular type. (I’m going to call her “Brenda” which isn’t her real name.) I’ll use parts of our exchanges from the past two weeks. I used her work before and received positive feedback from it--hope this helps some as well.(Disclaimer: there are some portions of this that some may view as R- or X-rated.)Here is a dialog portion of a scene of Brenda’s I commented on. This is an exchange between a Japanese WWII veteran (Takami) whom an American veteran (Jake) has just prevented from killing himself. It’s really well-written and would pass muster with most, but I felt it could be made even better as per my comments following this.“Hai, it is true. A Japanese warrior must fight to the death to protect his country, his Emperor. It is Bushido, the way of the warrior. But I was captured. So now, I bear my dishonor forever. Whether or not it was my choice.”He couldn’t believe what he was hearing. “Wow. That is really tough. But… how were you captured, anyway?”Takami dropped his eyes to the table top again. He furrowed his brow, bit his lip. “I was a navy lieutenant in command of a picket boat. A converted fishing trawler, really. Crew of ten besides myself. We were on patrol off the coast of Japan—in these waters, in fact.“We were on the lookout for American carriers. Headquarters had analyzed some radio traffic—we knew they were headed our way. But we weren’t sure of their exact plans.” Takami looked up at Jake. “Well, I sighted them. I took the stairs two at a time to the radio room, ordered the operator to report to the fleet. Stood over him while he radioed it out. But… the Americans saw us, too. They came after us with everything they had.” He sat just a little straighter. “I’m proud to say it took them a while to sink us.“First their fighters strafed us—a wave of Wildcats off one of the carriers. Then the dive bombers made passes at us. The seas were rough—we got tossed all ‘round—and my ship was small, so I guess we were hard to hit. Anyway, none of that stuff did any real damage. You know…” The corners of his lips and eyes lifted into something that was almost a smile. “I started to think the storm was some kind of divine wind sent to protect us.” He gave his head a slight shake. The wry smile disappeared. “But a cruiser opened up with her big guns. It was only a matter of time ‘til we took a hit.             “It was like the whole world exploded. I flew up off the deck. After that I remember nothing… Until I woke up on an American ship, in traction, concussion, third-degree burns, broken bones. Horyu.”Les says:Brenda, I think there’s a problem with Takami’s dialog is that it could just as easily be Jake’s. It doesn’t sound like a guy who’s been raised Japanese and probably learned English as a second language as an adult. Your police chief does and your other Japanese characters do, but not him. Other than an occasional Japanese word inserted into his dialog (Horyu, e.g.), his sentences just don’t sound like his character probably would. This is tough to do, I know. The danger is of giving him what I call “Tonto language.” It’s a term I came up with to describe those early screenwriters of Native American language, where they had them all saying stuff like “How” and speaking in telegram language where they leave out articles (i.e., the parts of speech like “the” and “an” and the like). Like: “Soaring eagle fly far overhead, near heap big mountain where Great Spirit lives.” This is better than that, most definitely (!), but I think it tips too far toward how any average American would talk rather than a Japanese. Also, I always wonder why when a foreigner in novels speaks English, he or she always finds it necessary to throw in a word from their native language occasionally. I don’t see Americans doing the same when they speak Spanish or French or Japanese, but invariably, in novels, foreigners all seem to have to need to do this. I’m being a bit facetious—I know why writers feel the need to do this—they feel it gives the speech the flavor of an ESL speaker, but it more gives the effect or contrived speech. It basically makes the reader aware that an author is at work, therefore interrupting the fictive dream.Couple of things I’d consider here, Brenda. One, you’ve got him opening up to Jake immediately, telling him personal things within five minutes of meeting him it would be hard for a longshoreman to confess in a Catholic confessional. He has no sense of reticence whatsoever. He’s basically, “Chatty Charlie.” This has the feel of a contrived scene. A somewhat dramatized way of getting a worldview across. Almost like an Ayn Rand novel, where the author has a political agenda and assembles a wooden play to preach to the choir. I know I’m being harsh here, but the passages with Miyako come across so realistically, but the ones with Jake and now Takima come across as those “Ayn Randish” kind of scenes. The place where the preaching begins. Much of that stems from the fact that almost all that happens in the Jake scenes are conversations. I know there was this brief bit where Takima tries to kill himself, but that’s just a tiny part of the scene and then it just goes into this confessional, conversation stuff. It’s really thinly-disguised exposition delivering a big chunk of backstory. I think it’s a major flaw and think you need to rethink the Jake portions of the story. Character is revealed by action and not much at all by dialog, introspection, and other forms of exposition. And that’s what’s missing in the Jake scenes—action. Even the dialog scenes—both between Jake and his wife and now, Jake and Takima—lack much conflict. You improved the wife scenes a lot by giving her a bit of opposition, but there’s virtually none here.Also, you’re trying to dole out too much here. I’d try to create a mosaic, rather than a slide show of complete scenes. What I mean by that is I think you sometimes lose track of the fact that you’ve got 350-400 pages to create a story in. Here, it seems as if you’re not developing characters and their relationships bit by bit, over time, but instead trying to deliver whole histories whole cloth.Here, for instance, think about showing the scene where Jake saves him from suicide and end with them going into the dining room. Get out of the scene at that point. Later on, after we get more of Miyako, come back to them talking, but don’t have Takima unburden himself of all this so readily. Make Jake have to drag it out of him more. This should be a big relationship in the novel, and you’re trying to create that all in one big scene. Make sense? Instead of all this lengthy confessional stuff, maybe just have him give Jake a short, curt reply to why he tried to kill himself. “My shame.” That’s it. Don’t have him elaborate at that point. Have Jake begin to earn his trust before he gives more and have him pull it out of him, little by little. That’s also a way to create tension with the reader. If you have him deliver what should be an intensely personal story en toto to this stranger like he has, you lose any possible tension and not only that, you create a character who’s largely unlikeable. Who likes a person who wears his heart on his sleeve and blurts out all this stuff this quickly? Most people don’t. And, I'd think that one from his culture would be even more reticent. Also, he should be resentful of Jake for thwarting his mission, and, instead, he’s becoming his best friend in the space of a few minutes. See what I mean?Later, in the remarks at the end of her submission for the week, I address this further:Brenda, sorry to kind of unload on the Jake/Takami scene, but you’ve done so well until then, that I think you need to rethink how you’ve delivered that scene to make it as good as the rest of this. Just think “piece by piece” in the story structure and not deliver huge chunks of it like you are there. Lead up to Takami’s revelation instead of delivering it whole.The story structure you’re employing in that scene reminds me of play structure. A drama where the playwright has to deliver big, start-to-finish scenes like that because of the type of audience he or she is writing for. If so, that’s a big mistake. Plays are examples of “cold media” while novels are “hot media” and the rules are vastly different.If you (or others in class) aren’t familiar with the theory of hot and cold media, it comes from Canadian philosopher Marshall McLuhan. He’s the guy who gave us brilliant theories such as: “The media is the message.” His theory of hot and cold media is that a cold media employs more than one sense and therefore the audience is largely passive and not much thought or imagination is required to receive the experience successfully. Hot media are those which only employ one sense and therefore the audience’s active participation in the form of their imaginations is required.Examples of cold media are TV, movies, and plays. There are at least two senses affected—sight and sound and, occasionally smell, as in the John Water’s movie, Polyester, and in some plays where odors are provided for various effects. That means the audience mostly has to just sit there and do nothing. There’s a valid reason why many feel that watching movies solely leads to the “dumbing down” of people. They just don’t do much with their minds when experiencing them. It’s kind of all done for them. One just sits in the theater and lets the experience wash over them passively. The brain is kind of put in neutral.Hot medias are totally different. They require the audience to employ their minds and imagination, because only one physical sense is affected. Hot medias require active participants among the audience for it to be an effective experience. Examples are novels and radio. Only sight is used in novels and only sound is used with radio. It’s why Orson Welles’ War of the Worlds, when broadcast over radio, created mass chaos and suicides, which wouldn’t have happened if it had been a movie at the time or a TV show. People used their imaginations, which are infinitely more intense than seeing aliens on the big screen can effect. In fact, even though we can become affected emotionally during say a horror movie, because of the FX effects and the thirty-foot images, as soon as the credits roll and we walk out of the theater, it’s over. Until… that night, when we go to sleep. Then, our imaginations take over and we wake up that night in a cold sweat, experiencing an infinitely deeper dread than we did earlier at the Cineplex. Our imaginations are infinitely more creative than anything Dream Works can ever cook up.All of this is just to show why you use the advantage of hot media when writing a novel. You become aware that the reader’s imagination is in play and use that to your benefit. That means that, unlike a play or a movie, you only create a skeleton and make the reader an active participant by having to provide the flesh. You don’t create scenes that explain everything. You create clues and hints and let the reader provide the rest. And, that’s what you’re not doing in the Jake/Takami scene. You’re providing everything and all in one fell swoop.I’d urge every writer to read Marshall McLuan’s work. More than anything else, it shows clearly the difference between all the media and is a wonderful resource to learn how to write a novel that’s effective. He should be required in all writing courses, imo.Hope this helps, Brenda! You’ve got a marvelous work going here. Just want to make sure you don’t misstep. Keep the overall picture in mind and don’t get lost in the trees!Week 2. In the next week’s submission, Brenda said:As usual, your comments last week were very insightful. I really was thinking about this more like a play, where you have only a fixed number of scenes to get all the key facts on the table. And you’re very right, Takami/Eiji becomes an important character in the story so I need to be thoughtful about where I take this relationship. I will have to give this some deep thought over break.To which I replied:Good. It just kept looking like a “play” mentality was taking over a bit. Plays, by necessity, pretty much have to be “dumbed down” structure-wise a bit to fit the dramatic parameters, but a novel is more fragmented, presented with bits and pieces, more like a mosaic. A novel is read at the audience’s leisure, giving the reader time to mull over and consider what’s going on, and parts can be gone over again, but a play is (usually) viewed once in “real time” and everything has to be visible and clear instantly or the audience is lost. And, a play is basically a “cold” media where more is provided the audience (sight and sound and sometimes even smell) and the audience is largely passive, receiving information. A novel is a “hot” media in that only one sense is affected (sight) and the audience has to bring their imaginations into play much more. It’s just more intellectual in nature, simply because of that. As long as the writer is aware of the differences and takes advantage of the advantages of each, she’ll be all right. But, it’s important not to use one framework for the other. Glad you see what was happening! With your (immense) talent, I’d expect you to nail this absolutely.Brenda said:I also agree that the Jake / Takami dialog scene was probably not very realistic the way I had written it, although it felt good at the time! Sigh.Les said:Just part of the deal. Writing is always rewriting. This is why almost all writing teachers advise the novelist, when finished, to put it in a drawer for at least a month before rewriting it. You’ll see the work for what it really is at that time, after some distance has been created.Brenda said:I have struggled with how to make my Japanese characters sound Japanese. I’ve had some comments from classmates on overly formal language I’ve given some of my characters (although I haven’t changed it). I’ve listened closely to Japanese business colleagues and it isn’t so much what they say, but the inflection and timing and tone in which they say it, that make them sound Japanese. So I’m not sure how to put that across on the page.Les said: It’s tough, but I have no doubt you’ll make it work. When I have trouble with a technique, I try to find writers who use that technique well. Here’s a “textbook” you might look at to see how a writer uses such a technique well—take a look at Andrew Klavan’s novel, Empire of Lies. In it, he has a major character who is obviously based on William Shatner. Look at how he portrays his speech to get ideas on how to portray Takimi’s speech. Now, I don’t mean to imply that Shatner speaks anything at all like Takimi, but just want to give you an example of how a different speech pattern can be shown by a skillful writer. You’ll notice he doesn’t do what Mark Twain did with his Jim character in Huckleberry Finn—using phonetic spellings to portray his speech (which isn’t done these days at all), but uses inflections, spacing of words as spoken, etc. Don’t misunderstand—not saying you should mimic what Klavan does but just see how he portrays one person’s speech, and that may give you ideas of how to do the same with Takimi’s, based on your observations of Japanese business colleagues. Delivery timing is an important component of effective dialog. It’s hard, but you’re just the person who can do it! Another good model of how to effectively use dialog patterns to define characters is virtually any Elmore Leonard work. There are lots of others, but these two come to mind at the moment.Brenda said:The only comment you made I’m not sure I agreed with was this one:The ones with Jake and now Takima come across as those “Ayn Rand” kind of scenes. The place where the preaching begins.I’m not seeing Jake as preachy so far, but he is a missionary, and preach is something he will do. In fact my rewrite of the Takami dialog is probably more preachy, cuz I think that to be realistic, this is a case in which he would preach. And pray. I hope you won’t hate it—I took your advice otherwise.Les said:Not to worry! I’m not going to hate it at all! But, think hard about your character. Before he became a missionary, he was something else, right? For one thing, he was a member of a crew on a bomber. Which means he had a particular sensibility and way of thinking and talking, probably much like any other average person. Then, he becomes a missionary and all of a sudden he’s thinking and speaking in “missionary-speak?” See what I mean? To portray him this way delivers kind of a stereotype, I think. I suspect that anyone who undergoes the kind of conversion he has wouldn’t suddenly change his everyday language and speech patterns to reflect the layperson’s idea of what a minister says and how he thinks. Does this make sense? What I’d (gently) suggest is to give him the same language and thought patterns of anyone else, and from time to time, use his “minister” language, i.e. “preachiness.” But, just not continually. He’s a relatively newbie in terms of being a missionary, right? Which means I’d think his old patterns of thought and language used wouldn’t have yet had time to make a full transition into “minister-speak.” Has he, for instance, gone to college and majored in theology by this point? Four years of being in such a program might have reprogrammed him into this mode of thought and speech, but if he hadn’t, it probably wouldn’t have happened yet. He would also be a different type of speaker and thinker if he’d been raised in a minister’s family, where he’d spent his entire life in such a milieu and been expected to become a pastor. See the difference? A lot of how you portray him would depend on stuff like this.Now, I know you said there is a true-life account of this man’s experience. And, in that (if he wrote it), the language used might be what I keep calling “minister-speak.” But, if so, I’d suspect that he wrote it as a minister, being fully aware of that role, and consciously used such language. That would be a natural thing for him to do as the author of such a work. But, the key to that is that he would “consciously” employ such language as the author, meaning it still wasn’t his “natural” language, but a more formal one he uses to write a book. To write his book as a kind of “animated” sermon or parable for a specific audience. I don’t know—just throwing possibilities out there for you to consider. Just keep in mind that you’re writing a novel and not a true-life account of your own life as he was. Big difference.That’s why I used the Ayn Rand reference. Rand wrote novels that were too-obviously thinly-veiled polemics for her political point of view. (Actually, I personally happen to agree with many of her politics, but not her novel-writing techniques, which were really of poor quality.) Giving her characters long monologues in which they make impassioned speeches is a very bad novelistic technique. She gets away with it because in many instances she’s “preaching to the choir,” her audience largely being college sophomores and those who already believe in her tenets. And, she happened to write in a different era and it’s doubtful she’d get published today since they’re really poorly-written. Good literature, it ain’t. Any political or religious book like hers or Marx’s Glen Beck's or Rachel Maddox's or anyone with a particular view outside the main is going to sell books. That’s fine, but they’re just not good models for novel writers. And, that’s all I’m concerned with here. Make sense?I just know that many readers get turned off when a character too much resembles a stereotype and that’s my fear with Jake. I think if you show him as just a regular guy in his thought processes and language patterns most of the time and only occasionally show him delivering sermon-like language and thoughts, you’ll make him a lot more likeable character. For instance, in the scenes with his wife, you might consider making him less of what the congregation might expect of a Billy Graham and more of a regular guy. I’ll bet even Billy didn’t think in terms of John the Baptist all the time, especially when he was in the sheets with Mrs. Graham… Make sense?This from Brenda’s novel for the week, from the thoughts of her Japanese character who’s become a prostitute to survive:Her life was a sham. The GIs’ gangling bodies. Their juices emptying into her. Faking her climax. Counting the money the instant they left.Les said:If she’s really a pro, she wouldn’t wait until they leave to count it but would count it before they even had sex. She would have learned this the first day on the job.) Are you aware that the most common sexual act prostitutes engage in is oral sex? Probably 10-1 to penetration. Especially street hookers. Doesn’t mean they don’t practice “regular” sex—they do—but by and large, b.j.’s are the biggest stock in trade. Lots of reasons for that. For one, oral sex is quicker and easier and infinitely more convenient as the girl doesn’t need much but an alley or the back seat of a car. Being quicker lets them make a lot more money as they are able to get back on the block a lot quicker for the next one. For “regular sex” a place is required, necessitating some kind of rent, which eats into the profit. And, a lot of johns are really ignorant about sex, feeling that oral sex won’t lead to venereal disease or AIDs—believe it or not, there are people that believe that. Lots of johns are on a fixed time frame as well—they’re getting sex on the way home and they don’t dare be too late. There are also those who want anal sex or other varieties and that’s pretty common. The reason a lot of johns look up prosties is to get stuff their wives won’t do (except with the pool man, which they neglect to tell their husbands…).Another thing you might want to address, that in very few societies (including Japan) is it easy or even possible for a girl to freelance. There are those who do, but they’re relatively rare. I’d think she’d have to go through some s**t to be able to work without a pimp. It would really be dangerous for her if she didn’t have a guy to work for. She’d face problems with other girls who’d know she didn’t have protection, for one thing, and would be motivated to get rid of the competition since she doesn’t have anyone to protect her. It’s not some kind of cozy “girl’s club” out there, but a violent, extremely competitive milieu. She’d also have to be able to fend off those pimps who would try to force her to join their stable. She’d also have no protection from johns. She’d be without someone to bail her out when she got arrested, a big part of a pimp’s job. Not saying she’d have to have a pimp—there are those who don’t—but they’re relatively rare, especially in the case of a street hooker. Almost nonexistent and the ones who do operate that way usually do so because they’ve got some serious stones. She doesn’t seem to be that type. Also, her girlfriend didn’t seem to have one either, and while one hooker may be a freelancer, again, that’s a rarity, and two are really a rarity. In fact, so far we haven’t seen any pimps at all in her “working” scenes. If she’s working in a large Japanese city, surely the “bad hands” or yakuza would be in control and it’s virtually impossible to freelance. Think you need to address that and give a plausible reason for her not to have a pimp. Or, you might consider giving her one, which might add even more complexity to the story.The above is a fairly typical exchange between a student and myself. We try to look at everything important that’s going on in the writing, from dialog to character realism and motivation and everything else that can make it better. What happens often is that writers create their characters from stereotypes they’ve assimilated from hundreds of (incorrect) movies and books and that means what we (readers) get are… stereotypes. And, worse… incorrect stereotypes.As I think you can see by the small samples of the writing, “Brenda” is a terrific writer and without my comments would probably end up with a publishable book. What we’re both after isn’t simply a publishable book, but a great book. I can see already that she’s going to accomplish that. And, when it gets published, be assured I’m going to tell everybody here about it and urge you to buy it!Hope this helps!Blue skies,Les"},
{"title": "BOOK REVIEW OF CORT MCMEEL'S NOVEL TITLED: SHORT", "date": "Monday, December 6, 2010", "text": "Hi folks,I'm posting something a bit different. Cortright McMeel, a writer I've admired for a long time has his first novel coming out from St. Martin's Press. He asked me to write a review for it for Amazon which I'm posting below. Cort found me several years ago when he founded the national noir magazine, Murdaland, and invited me to submit a story for their first issue. From that moment, we became good friends. He has a dream of creating his own press and came close but at the last minute his financing fell through. We're both hoping he realizes enough from this novel for him to start up his press, which will focus on noir ala Georges Simenon. Cort believes in my work and wants to publish one of my novels as his press's first offering. It would be a distinct honor for me--he's a superb editor and knows the world of noir better than anyone I know.Anyway, I loved the novel he wrote. It's breathtakingly original and the language is pure poetry. The story is simply, powerful. I hope lots of you glom onto a copy--you won't be sorry.Here's the review I wrote (which doesn't do it the justice it deserves.).  DON’T “SHORT” YOURSELF—READ MCMEEL’S NOVELWe’ve seen financial thrillers before—such bestselling novels such as Joseph Finder and James Grippando have provided, as well as accounts of insider Wall Street reporting as Michael Lewis’ (The Big Short) and Harry Markopolos’ expose of Bernie Madoff in his seminal No One Would Listen come to mind—but Cortright McMeel’s first novel, Short, pioneers new territory. Not a thriller in the vein of Finder or a expose such as Markopolos delivers, but rather, Short delivers us a character-driven existential work that goes much deeper than a simple detective yarn or a fact-laden historical work. In Short, we see deeply into the minds and motivations of the characters and all the permutations of greed the human animal is capable of. The characters who people this novel are not only creating a scheme to short electrical power and make obscene fortunes; they are shorting their own spirituality. And… they all lose.McMeel has created a cautionary tale of greed gone amok, of acts of terrorism as heinous as from any militant jihad, only for fortunes and not souls. A landscape of lust and gluttony, Bibical in its scope. Of the horror of modern society and the moral landscape that has shifted to naked materialism sans any semblance of moral character.Trader Joe Gallagher becomes enmeshed in a scheme to short electrical power by his boss The Ghost whose machinations include an act of terrorism as heinous as any jihad, and almost succeeds until a tropical storm turns the wrong way and becomes Hurricane Katrina, wiping out all the players in its path. Gallagher has his own agenda and ends up making money, but still comes up short on the ledger of life as he’s fired and loses his wife Celina along the way.In fact, everyone loses and readers expecting to find a formulaic ending in which characters are changed as a result will discover a much more noir-like finale and one which more accurately reveals the place we find ourselves in the reality of today’s society.The reader will be rewarded with more than a powerful story. McMeel delivers a original voice that is sure to draw comparisons to some of our best stylists. At turns, the prose becomes lyrical and poetic, as in this passage…Celina felt comfortable among her old friends. The feeling of being in a nexus of the art world among artists made Celina feel as if she had woken up from a deep sleep. Her eyes and ears cannibalized the room, taking in the various energies, the steely hope of the up and comers, the sucking sound made by the failures and the struggling, the tittering of industry minions and the smug, leering eyes of the wealthy buyers, professionals, middle aged men in pressed pants. She was normally so far away from this and the room began to pulse like a heart beat. Celina was aware of the hunger sweeping over her like it does those recovering from a sickness; the appetite, so long suppressed, returns ravenous tenfold, almost to the point of passion.…to profound insights…There is a difference between boxers and warriors. The old veteran’s of the trading floor fought for more than money, more than the game, it was a strange war to them, one that would never end until the trader’s on the other end were destroyed and they were victorious. Theirs was a taste of something that they themselves could not define. The only glimpse of it could be seen when they were up a crapload of money and they had a look on their face that was not of happiness, nor giddiness with riches, but one of relief. That moment which would make any normal man ecstatic, merely served as brief respite for them before they embarked on their next campaign, the result of which would have them losing what they had won or making more. Gallagher wondered if the way trading was for them, a life or death affair, was more of a blessing or a curse. …and the heart of the matter…As Stan spoke and praised the Lord and his life and his wife and his luck and his house and his pool and his job and his country and his faith, Milt bore inside his own belly an evil, yellow-fanged, greedy, ugly, growling demon, even more hungry and obscene than usual. Milt felt he saw Stan’s preaching for what it was, a selfish need to exorcise guilt by saving others.In the end, none of the players escape the insanity. Which is the brilliance of this novel. The author knows the truth of the matter—that learning one is mad doesn’t constitute a cure. This is Camus’ The Stranger written by a spiritual descendant of Kafka and decidedly worth your time."},
{"title": "PLOTTING", "date": "Thursday, December 2, 2010", "text": "I recently received an email from a writer who asked me for advice on how on “how to create and write an inciting incident for a scene” in her novel.This was a new one on me, as my view of a novel is that there’s one inciting incident per novel. Upon further investigation, it turned out this person had attended a writer’s workshop in which the leader of the workshop advocated an inciting incident to create a scene as a component of scenes.I’ve tried to wrap my brain around this concept, but can’t see how such a thing could possibly exist. It simply goes against how stories are created. Publishable stories, at least. Perhaps stories that are “only available in one’s room” can have an inciting incident to kick-start each scene, but of all the thousands and thousands of novels I’ve read, I can’t recall a single one that included inciting incidents as the beginnings of the scenes in any of them.Here’s how I answered the emailer.TROUBLEFirst, a story is about one thing always. Trouble. And, in today’s market, that’s where novels need to begin. When the trouble begins. And here’s where part of the problem comes from. “Trouble” in literary terms doesn’t mean the same thing as it does in lay terms. Trouble in lay terms (i.e. “real life”) can mean any kind of difficulty at all—you can’t pay the rent, your mate is divorcing you, your mate is sleeping with someone else, your best friend is murdered or kidnapped or raped (or you have…), your teacher has just failed you in class, a comet is headed for earth, the wrong person is elected President… you name it, those are all troubles in real life. But, trouble in literature isn’t the same thing. While it can take the same form as those listed, it’s a much different animal in fiction.Surface problems and story-worthy problemsTrouble in fiction is presented first as a surface problem. That can take the form of almost anything, including all of those real-life problems above and almost anything else that represents trouble in one’s life. But… and this is a huge “but”—the surface problem has to be representative of a much bigger issue in the protagonist’s life, what I’ve called the “story-worthy problem.” This is a deeper, psychological issue that the surface problem is symptomatic of.It takes the protagonist’s struggle to resolve the surface problem, and that struggle, little by little through that struggle, eventually reveals the true and much deeper, story-worthy problem. Usually the story-worthy problem is resolved at the same time the surface problem is, in the final scene of the novel. Once the problem(s) resolved, the story is over.Both problems are the same problem. The surface problem exists solely to create the events of the story. If you began with the story-worthy problem there could be no story. It takes the struggle to resolve the surface problem to reveal the real, deeper problem to the protagonist. Without that struggle, there would be no story. The character would just go into therapy.ExamplesIn The Silence of the Lambs, Clarisse is trying to catch Buffalo Bill as her surface problem… which leads her to the discovery of her real, story-worthy problem—dealing with the demons in her childhood. She couldn’t save the lamb from being slaughtered when a child, and she goes into the FBI to be able to save the “lambs” (i.e., victims) of serial killers like Buffalo Bill and to prove herself worthy to the man she worships as a hero—her father. It is only through the struggle to resolve her surface problem (catching Buffalo Bill) and with the insights provided by Hannibal Lector, that she discovers what she’s really been trying to resolve. She actually doesn’t resolve her story-worthy problem, as evidenced by her inability to be able to answer Hannibal’s final phone call—this is a story whose conclusion answers some questions but raises even more—but she’s at last aware of her personal demons and that is a resolution in itself.In Thelma & Louise, Thelma’s surface problem is to escape, even if just for a weekend, her overbearing husband Darryl. Her story-worthy problem is to escape a totally male-dominated society.In Indiana Jones, the protagonist’s surface problem is to find the Holy Grail. His story-worthy problem is to gain his father’s respect. When he first begins his quest, all he knows is that he wants the Grail for professional reasons—at the end, he realizes he was after the relic solely to prove his worth to his father. It took the struggle to lead him to that realization and to resolve his story-worthy problem by knowing that he can’t achieve his self-respect by gaining his father’s respect, but that one gains self-respect irregardless of how others view him. Without all he goes through to gain the Grail, he could never have come to that realization or even known what his real problem was.In each of these examples, as well as any of thousands and thousands of other novels and films, the surface problem is just that—a surface problem representative of a much deeper, more intensely psychological problem it’s symptomatic of—the story-worthy problem. Can’t have one without the other. This is why many novelists fail. They have a surface problem… but no story-worthy problem. Without that, it’s simply pulp fiction and not much good. It’s just too shallow.Okay. With me so far? Good. I know that was a bit of a lengthy explanation of what appears to be a simple term—trouble—but it’s important to understand the definitions of the terms we use. We borrow our writer’s terms from the lay language, and too often, the student assumes those definitions are the same and more often than not, they carry additional connotations. I routinely see my new students who see the word “trouble” and just assume it means their story can be about the “bad things in life.” (Usually and more often—the melodramatic bad things like kidnappings, murders, rapes, et al.). Those kinds of troubles can, indeed, work, but there has to be more at stake than simply solving a murder, gaining a lover, etc.Inciting incident—where the story beginsNow, if you buy all this, and agree that stories need to begin where the trouble (the surface problem) begins, then that means the story has to begin with the inciting incident. The definition of the inciting incident is: Something that happens to the protagonist that creates and/or reveals the surface problem to the protagonist.It’s extremely important to look at every single word in that definition to fully grasp it. By being an event that “happens to” the protagonist, that means it’s something that’s happened to which the protagonist has to react to. And, it’s virtually the only time in the story that the protagonist gets to react. After that scene, (s)he has to become proactive in resolving the problem. (That doesn’t mean the protagonist never gets to react. Of course she does. But, not in terms of resolving the problem. The major actions that create the plot turns all have to be initiated by the protagonist.) He or she absolutely must be proactive on their own behalf to resolve their problem and never depend on or be helped by fate, coincidence, other characters, to resolve that problem. That doesn’t mean others can’t help them, but when they do it has to be because of something the protagonist did to effect that help. It can’t just be out of the blue, but as a result of the protagonist’s own actions.Causal plotsWhat this means is that good plots are causal. (Not casual!) This happens (inciting incident) in which a surface problem is created and/or revealed and that causes the protatonist to take an action to resolve it. That action to resolve the problem must end in failure. (Again “failure” doesn’t have quite the same definition as the lay term. It simply means the action taken can’t resolve the problem, ergo the “failure.”) When the first action ends in such failure, the protagonist has to come up with a new action to resolve the problem. Which will end in failure again to resolve the problem. However, the failure may and should lead to the protagonist getting closer to resolution. It’s just a failure in terms of resolving the problem. It can and should succeed inasfar as getting closer to the solution. And so on until the final scene in which the problem is resolved. Once the problem is resolved, the story’s over. The point is, plots are always causal. This happens which causes this which causes this which… you get the point.What has to be on every single page of the novel is the surface problem (as well as bit-by-bit revelations of the story-worthy problem, both to the protagonist and to the reader.). The story should never depart from that. That’s why subplots always have to be subservient to the main story—the struggle to resolve the problem. They can’t be separate stories, but have to play a role in support of the primary problem. In Thelma & Louise, there are several subplots. One is the relationship between the two women. Thelma’s friendship with Louise is a subplot totally dependent and serving the main plot as Louise provides the function of being a mentor to Thelma, among other things. The romance Thelma has with J.T. isn’t just some sex stuff in there to satisfy a romantic element. When they have sex, it’s the precise physical action that transforms her into a woman. Again, it’s a subplot that’s subservient to the main plot.And, this brings me back to the original subject of this article. The writer wanting to know how to create and write inciting incidents for scenes.Episodic storiesThis kind of stance suggests to me that she’s thinking of episodic stories. (Which, incidentally, aren’t publishable.) The kind of thinking where you create this really cool character and/or situation and set ‘em loose to have neat-o adventures. That isn‘t a novel, unfortunately. Even Indiana Jones isn’t an episodic story, although it may appear to be so on the surface. Everything he does is to resolve his problem—recover the Holy Grail (and, win his father’s approbation).The story problem is the spine of every good story. It’s what everything in the novel has to be attached to and firmly. It’s causal. The plot simply must be causal.A novel isn’t a journey in the sense that the protagonist is traveling around having adventures. (Another instance of a writer assigning a lay definition to a writing term.) It’s a journey with a destination in mind all the way and with every single step. The destination is the resolution of the problem. Nothing can or should interfere with that, not even for five seconds. If the protagonist can depart, even briefly, from the goal of resolving their problem, it wasn’t a good enough problem for the novel. Nothing can get in the way of that goal for any reason.In Thelma & Louise, to the person watching it on a surface level may think that that’s mainly what Thelma does—drive around with Louise, go to bars, pick up guys, etc., and have a series of adventures. But, that’s a person who’s not thinking as a writer. When she pleads with Louise to go to the roadhouse, it’s an action she’s taking to resolve the problem of her overbearing husband. When she kicks back the traces and gets drunk and dances with Harlan, it’s an extension of the same action to resolve the problem of her husband who’s kept her in a prison during their relationship. And so on. Everything in the story is a direct and causal action to resolve her problem. And, each action fails to resolve the problem until the final action and scene which both reveals to her her true problem and resolves both the surface and story-worthy problems.Therefore, there isn’t any “inciting incident to begin a scene.” Each scene is simply the next action the protagonist takes to resolve the surface problem. The failure to resolve the previous scene is the “inciting incident.” To create an inciting incident for scenes just doesn’t make any kind of sense whatsoever. It’s already created. She failed in the previous scene. She still has the problem, only now it seems even further away. Her motivation is that she desperately wants to resolve the problem. Period. To even think about creating some kind of “inciting incident” to begin scenes with is… well, it’s really ludicrous. It’s not this writer’s fault—it’s something she heard at a workshop. Personally, I’d ask for a refund… Or, she may have misunderstood what they were talking about.We haven’t talked about sequel, but I suspect that’s what she may have been thinking of. Sequel is the novel element that follows scene. I won’t go into depth here about sequels as I’ve covered that in prior posts and it’s in my book, Hooked, but basically, sequel is this:Scenes all have to end in failure (in terms of the protagonist not resolving the problem.). Okay? Well, just as in “real life” when this happens, immediately after a setback like this an emotional reaction occurs. (This is the beginning of sequel.) Upon failure, the character feels something. Frustration, sadness, anger, despair, whatever. She failed to achieve resolution. That’s the emotional part and beginning of sequel. This is the place in our novels where we get to do all that exposition and summary. This is where flashbacks go. Backstory and all that junk. And then, during the course of sequel, the protagonist begins to switch from the emotional to the intellectual, and the protagonist begins to figure out a Plan 2 to resolve the problem. As soon as that plan has been decided on, the sequel is over and… you guessed it… the next scene begins.Possibly, this is what my emailer was thinking about. The end of the sequel following the previous scene. But, that’s not an inciting incident. It’s what creates the occasion of the next scene, but it’s not an inciting incident. It doesn’t fit any of the definition of an inciting incident. It fits the definition of the end of sequel. BTW, for a great discussion of sequel, get Jack Bickham’s Scene & Structure.I hope this helps anyone else who may be struggling with plot or have a misconception about inciting incidents!Remember: One inciting incident per novel…Blue skies,Les"},

Wish I knew who came up with these so I could give them credit, but have no idea. Anyway… enjoy!New Rules of LifeNew Rule: Stop giving me that pop-up ad for Classmates.com! There's a reason I don't talk to people for 25 years. Because I don't particularly like them! Besides, I already know what the captain of the football team is doing these days: mowing my lawn and applying fertilizer. New Rule: Don't eat anything that's served to you out a window unless you're a seagull. People are acting all shocked that a human finger was found in a bowl of Wendy's chili. Hey, it cost less than a dollar. What did you expect it to contain? Trout? Luckily, it was only a finger! If it was a whole hand, Congress would have voted to keep it alive. New Rule: Stop saying that teenage boys who have sex with their hot, blonde teachers are permanently damaged. I have a better description for these kids: lucky son of a guns. New Rule: Ladies, leave your eyebrows alone. Here's how much men care about your eyebrows: do you have two of them? Okay, we're done. New Rule: There's no such thing as flavored water. There's a whole aisle of this shit at the supermarket - water, but without that watery taste. Sorry, but flavored water is called a soft drink. You want flavored water? Pour some scotch over ice and let it melt. That's your flavored water. New Rule: Stop messing with old people. Target is introducing a redesigned pill bottle that's square, with a bigger label. And the top is now the bottom. And by the time grandpa figures out how to open it, his butt will be in the morgue. Congratulations, Target, you just solved the Social Security crisis. New Rule: The more complicated the Starbucks order, the bigger the idiot. If you walk into a Starbucks and order a \"decaf grande half-soy, half-low fat, iced vanilla, double-shot, gingerbread cappuccino, extra dry, light ice, with one Sweet-n-Low and one NutraSweet,\" ooh, you're a huge idiot. New Rule: I'm not the cashier! By the time I look up from sliding my card, entering my PIN number, pressing \"Enter,\" verifying the amount, deciding, no, I don't want cash back, and pressing \"Enter\" again, the kid who is supposed to be ringing me up is standing there eating my Almond Joy. Paper, plastic? I don't have time for that. I've just been called to do a cleanup on Aisle Nine! New Rule: Just because your tattoo has Chinese characters in it doesn't make you spiritual. It's right above the crack of your ass. And it translates to \"beef with broccoli.\" The last time you did anything spiritual, you were praying to God you weren't pregnant. You're not spiritual. You're just high. New Rule: Competitive eating isn't a sport. It's one of the seven deadly sins. ESPN recently televised the US Open of Competitive Eating, because watching those athletes at the poker table was just too fricking exciting. What's next, competitive farting? Oh, wait. They're already doing that. It's called \"The Howard Stern Show.\" New Rule: I don't need a bigger mega M&M. If I'm extra hungry for M&Ms, I'll go nuts and eat two. New Rule: If you're going to insist on making movies based on crappy old television shows, then you have to give everyone in the Cineplex a remote so we can see what's playing on the other screens. Let's remember that the reason something was a television show in the first place is the idea wasn't good enough to be a movie. New Rule: No more gift registries. You know, it used to be just for weddings. Now it's for babies and new homes and graduations from rehab. Picking up the stuff you want and having other people buy it for you isn't gift-giving, it's the white people version of looting. New Rule: and this one is long overdue: No more bathroom attendants. After I zip up, some guy is offering me a towel and a mint like I just made it with George Michael. I can't even tell if he's supposed to be there, or just some freak with a fetish. I don't want to be on your web cam, dude. I just want to wash my hands. New Rule: When I ask how old your toddler is, I don't need to know in months. \"27 Months.\" \"He's two,\" will do just fine. He's not a cheese. And I didn't care in the first place. *25 ways to tell if you're a Redneck1. The Halloween pumpkin on your porch has more teeth than your spouse.2.

That means that for the next thirty years, you’re going to have to handfeed him baby food for every meal.“That means that for the next thirty years, you’re going to have to wipe his butt.“That means that for the next thirty years, you’re not going to be able to take a single day off. You’re going to have to be there for every minute of every day and every night in case he has a relapse.”Brenda sat down heavily in one of those uncomfortable chairs they furnish waiting rooms with.“Oh, my,” she said. “Well… what’s the good news?”The doc smiled. “The good news is that your husband’s had a massive stroke, but I lied. He died.”(If you smiled at this, you've just crossed over and no legitimate rehab in the world will take you in...)"},
{"title": "SAMPLE OF A QUERY LETTER THAT WORKED", "date": "Tuesday, November 23, 2010", "text": "Disclaimer—some of the material here is what might be considered “R-” or even “X-rated\" by the folks who rate things for us so that we don’t accidentally stumble onto something that we might have witnessed in junior high. Seriously, I don’t mean to offend anyone, so just be forewarned that some of the stuff here (in the story sample that follows) is a bit raw.Hi folks,I thought you might find it interesting and perhaps helpful to post a query letter for one of my novels to see perhaps a different take on such tools. While books on the subject of query letters, along with columns and blogs are helpful, I think that sometimes in trying to follow all the dos and don’ts we see in those sources, we may become overly-anal when composing our sales letters (which is what they are, right?). In the following query--which resulted in a success rate of 100% of those queried (agents and editors) asking to read the entire mss—I simply tried to create a letter that would do one thing—make the reader want to read the novel.I’ve followed some of the so-called “rules” of these things… and I’ve broken or ignored others. As a former litmag editor who read thousands of submissions, I quickly noticed a commonality in almost all of the cover letters folks sent along with their stories. Almost to a person, each cover letter resembled whatever current book or article or blog post on cover letters and query letters that was then popular. The writer had just plugged in different names in the blanks and what resulted was an almost exact copy of the sample letter in the book.I suspect the same thing happens with query letters which are kind of like cover letters and follow many of the same conventions. I know that when I encountered yet another of these slightly-altered clone cover letters, I threw up a little in my mouth and popped a Tums, and I would guess that agents have the same reaction when reading the four thousandth and one query letter that looks pretty much like the previous four thousand.To be honest, when I was an editor, I never read cover letters until I came upon a short story that I liked. Only then would I look at the sender’s cover letter. Didn’t read any of the others. They were all so similar that all I could see was a future date with me on my deathbed with minutes to go until I could start going toward the light, and wishing desperately I had all that time I’d spent on reading mind-numbing cover letters back…But, agents and editors don’t have that luxury. They have to read the query letters to find a novel description that they may like.I think the primary consideration in writing a query letter should be to make it entertaining. After all, that’s the business we’re in—entertainment—and if the letter is pretty much like the previous ten thousand the agent has read, the entertainment value thing is pretty well shot.That doesn’t mean it needs to be “cutesy” or “precious” or anything like that… unless, of course, you’re writing a novel for the “precious” market and see pink book covers for it… It should be a pretty good reflection of the novel you’re selling and it’s a good idea (I think) to mirror the voice and tone of that novel.I see I’m starting to deliver “rules” at this point, so I’ll quit and just show the dang thing.Dear Agent;In my completed 92,000 word black comedy thriller, titled:THE GENUINE, IMITATION, PLASTIC KIDNAPPING... a couple of two-bit hustlers come up with the bright idea of kidnapping the New Orleans Cajun Mafia King...with a twist. Instead of 'napping his entire body unit, the pair figure to amputate his hand...and hold that appendage for some serious jack. This is their story and how even though everything went wrong that could, they still won. Well, one of them did...sort of...PETE HALLIDAY, turned out of baseball for gambling, and his smarmy sidekick, part-Indian and full-time polluter, TOMMY LECLERC, both in heavy debt to bookies, get the bright idea to get on the plus side of the ledger by kidnapping the Big Sleazy’s Cajun Mafia King, CHARLES LACY DENEUVE, but with the aforementioned twist. They get the loot—Deneuve, unfortunately, is unable to reattach his primary meat hook as it has suffered extreme freezer burn having not been burped properly placing it in a baggie and storing it in Tommy's girlfriend WANDA’S freezer under the veal cutlets—but Tommy doublecrosses Pete and escapes with the swag. With girlfriend CAT DUPLAISIR, a part-time hooker whose specialty is walking on client's backs in heels with a whip in hand and other tricks and stratagems of the hustling trade by his side, Pete recovers the loot and the chase is on. SAM “THE BAM” CAPALETTI, the Italian Mafia, and the Cajun Mafia go after Pete and Cat, through the French Quarters, the Jazz Fest and even in the \"Mighty Oil Slick\" before they escape. They decide to hide out in the open in Lost Wages by getting plastic surgery to look like famous folks and at the last minute, Cat talks Pete into going to a plastic surgeon who promises the lowest prices in town as he's sliced all the frills from his practice—frills such as over-priced anesthetics, a downtown office, or a nurse with a current license. They end up looking like famous people, albeit not the ones they had in mind. Instead of the Big El, Pete looks like a skinny Liberace with yellow teeth and Cat... well, instead of Cher, Cat now resembles Bette Midler with black hair and a big schnozz...Think: Chris Moore meets David Sedaris and they have a love child with multiple deformities, none of a serious nature... unless it's your own self who happens to be the said love child... This book will appeal to fans of Christopher Moore, Tim Dorsey, and Stephan Jaramillo, among others (including my own fans which are legion and number in the dozens…).I have nine books in print and work of mine has been nominated for or won: the Pushcart, O. Henry Award, Edgar Allan Poe Award (short story category), PEN/Faulkner Award, Texas Institute of Letters' Jesse Jones Award, and the Violet Crown Book Award. I hold the MFA in Writing from Vermont and a Certificate in Barbering from Pendleton Reformatory, both of which I count as of equal weight in value, especially the latter as I actually made a living with it.It may be of mild interest that this story evolved from a short story I published in The South Carolina Review and I liked these characters so much I also wrote a screenplay that was a finalist in both the Writer's Guild and Best of Austin screenwriting competitions (reg. WGAe). I’ve refrained from sending the screenplay out for coverage pending publication of the novel.I’m including the first 5 pages of KIDNAPPING below, to give you a taste of the voice. Thank you for reading and considering my query. I'd be delighted to send you the completed mss.Sincerely,Les Edgerton(Contact info)SAMPLE PAGESTHE GENUINE, IMITATION, PLASTIC KIDNAPPINGByLes Edgerton2003A STREETCAR NOT NAMED DESIRE            The first glitch came up right away. In fine-tuning the kidnap plan, in which Tommy explained we'd go in dressed in three-piece suits like insurance salesmen in case any neighbors were up and about and noticed two guys dressed like shrimpers at this guy's house early in the morning. Well, I didn't have a three-piece suit and not even a two-piece suit, and, upon further researching my memory, didn't even have a sports coat and after quizzing Tommy, discovered he didn't have one either. I figured we'd just go in like we were dressed, but Tommy wouldn't have none'a that.            \"Jeez Louise, Pete. We can't do that. This is a big-money community where this guy lives. In-ground swimming pools, that gives you any idea. We show up looking like we usually dress, there's gonna be some lame across the street calling the cops for the two guys look like a home-invasion team.\"            Turns out he had a plan to get us a few bucks to get suits with. It was a strange-enough idea I thought it could work. I guess you had to be there when he was laying it down. Sounded righteous enough then... I mean, the guy was an Indian...*                                                          *                                                          *            An hour later, Tommy and me are sitting on the St. Charles streetcar, at the stop by the zoo down by Club 4141, watching people get on in the front. The last two on are a young tourist couple in matching yellow Bermuda shorts.            \"Cool,\" Tommy said. \"Tourists. They'll have cash.\" He took a drag from his cigarette. He was sitting directly under the \"No Smoking\" sign, but held it outside the window.            I didn't disagree. There were maybe fifteen people on board, not counting us and the motorman. This was looking better and better. Might get as much as a couple of thousand out of this crew. Get us suits somewhere else than the bargain bins of the Men's Warehouse.            \"See that?\" Tommy said. I followed his eyes which were locked on the buxom female member of the tourist couple. She was a looker.            \"Yeah? So?\"            \"So this.\" He brought his forearm up, pretending to take a bite out of it.            \"You wish,\" I said, grinning.            \"Yeah, well I got something her boyfriend ain't.\"            I laughed out loud. \"Right, Tommy. Ugliness. But I think she's maybe one of those weirdos goes for brains and looks. At least one of those.\"            Tommy turned and gave me a look. \"I'm talking technique here,\" he said. \"I got this technique.\"            \"Technique?\"            \"Technique.\"            \"What... you got a cute way of gettin' on and off?\"            \"Naw, man,\" he said, shaking his head like he can't believe how dumb I am. \"That's like a big dick. Everybody's got that.\"            I snickered. \"I don't recall you was so blessed in the big wang department, Tommy.\"            \"Yeah, well I was cold that time. We just got out of the lake, for crissake. See, Pete, being a champion at sex is like being good at basketball. You got to be able to go strong to the hole.\"            There was a young gal behind us who I could see was trying to ignore what Tommy was saying. She squirmed in her seat and studied the scenery out the window, them mansions sliding by.            I was dying to know Tommy's 'technique,' and asked him.            \"I piss in 'em,\" he said.            The gal behind us grabbed her purse and sniffed, loud, got up and moved three rows back to the last seat.            \"Fuck you, lady,\" Tommy muttered. \"You don't like the conversation, relocate.\"            I couldn't help smiling. \"She did. What's this pissing thing?\"            I saw the street sign flash by. Coming up was where we planned to do our thing. The corner where St. Charles turned onto Carrollton, by the Camellia Grill. Three blocks from where we'd stashed Tommy's Nova to make our getaway.            \"Never mind,\" I said. \"Here it comes. You ready?\"            \"I was born ready,\" Tommy said. He stood up and reached his hand into his waistband.            The gal who had relocated screamed out, \"This man has a gun!\"            Shit.            The streetcar went nuts. Pandemonium erupted—passengers screaming, brakes screeching as the conductor slammed the car to a half. Tommy lost his balance and recovered. The tourist woman in the front screamed one long banshee scream—Ayyyyeeeeeeeaaahhhh! She's just one long scream, punctuated only by the times she has to draw breath.            Eeeeeeeeeaaaaaayaaaaah! Ayaayaaya! Aaaaaayaeeee!            \"Shut up!\" Tommy screamed. \"Shut the hell up!\"            He looked down at me where I was just kind of sitting, pretty much in shock.            \"You on a break here, Pete?\"            I just gawked at him. This wasn't what I'd envisioned. His eyes left mine and I followed his stare to the gal who'd blown the whistle on us in the rear seat. She had a gun out, trained on him with both hands, just like they do on TV. I couldn't move. My entire life didn't flash before my eyes, but about twenty-six years and three months of it did.            \"I'm throwing up in my mouth, is what I'm doing,\" I said. What had I got into?            \"You'll wanna brush your teeth before you kiss any girls, then,\" he said.            Tommy brought his own gun up to bear on the woman in back, same two-handed grip she had. Mexican standoff.            He turned his head slightly down to me, still keeping his gaze on the woman. \"Shoot her!\" he said. This was just completely screwed.            \"You got the gun, Captain Marvel,\" I said, finally. \"You shoot her.\"            Instead of answering or shooting her, he began to back up toward the front door, his piece still trained on the woman. I got up to follow him. It got worse. Four people in the back pulled out weapons and pointed them our way.            \"Shit! Shit, shit, shit!\" It was all Tommy could say. My sentiments exactly.            I had to hand it to him, though. He didn't lose it.            \"Look, folks,\" he said. \"We're gonna just get off now, leave all you good people be. Everybody just stay calm.\"            One of the male armed passengers near the back door stood up. He said, \"Like hell. I'm taking you out, cowboy.\"            I felt like I was going to pass out.            The conductor opened the front door with his control and stood up. \"Let 'em go,\" he said. \"I don't want no blood in my car.\"            The guy with the gun didn't like what he was hearing. \"Aw, man,\" he said in a whiney voice. \"You can't just let criminals roam around. We got to take a stand. This is New Orleans, not Pansy-Ass-New-York-City. We don't take no prisoners in this town.\"            \"Listen, Dirty Harry,\" the conductor said. \"This is my streetcar. I make the rules. Siddown and shut up and let these folks pass.\"            Tommy ran for the door and I was closer than his shadow behind him, leaping off a nanosecond after he did, scrambling as fast as we could across the street.            The mouthy man and the woman in back opened up with their pistolas. I didn't turn back to look, just kept running as hard as I could, but I heard glass shattering, people screaming, and the pop-pop-pop of handguns. Something whizzed just past my ear and I was pretty sure it wasn't a mosquito unless insects came in calibers. I ran right into a braking car, bounced off the hood, got up and kept on running. My side was on fire. Any second now, I imagined a hot piece of lead finding my skull or some other tender part. The regrets were coming as fast as the bullets and I kept wondering like you do in such times of stress when it was exactly that God had dropped my case and went off to take a nap or something.            I knew when. Like all of my wrong turns, it had started with my gambling jones.*                                                          *                                                          *END OF SAMPLEThis was the letter that snagged me my agent. Did he sell this novel yet? Well, no, because I had another novel he thought was even more marketable and that’s the one we’re going with at present. KIDNAPPING is on the on-deck circle though. So, at this time, it’s “only available in my room,” but he and I are both confident it’ll end up at Border’s.I think the secret to writing an effective query letter is to remember that you had a lot of fun writing the story and to convey that same feeling of excitement to the agent. Not by telling him or her you had all that wild fun, but by showing from what’s on the page the joy you experienced in creating it.One thing I would always include, no matter what the agent says about it—I’d always send a small sample of the novel. Always. In the final analysis, that’s probably what’s going to get you a yea or a nay.Hope this helps!Blue skies,Les"},
{"title": "THE VALUE OF PRE-PUBLICATION BLURBS", "date": "Saturday, November 13, 2010", "text": "Hi folks,I’d like to bring up a topic I don’t see addressed on the writer’s and agent’s blogs I visit—the potential value of pre-pub blurbs.First, because I know there are different levels of writers who visit this site—from very new and beginning writers to established pros—for the benefit of the new writers, a blurb is an endorsement of someone respected and who has name cachet. It’s those little paragraphs you see on the covers or books by someone whose name you recognize who vows that the book you hold in your hands is the best thing since sliced bread.Also included in the category of blurbs are the reviews from various publications that also grace the covers of books. I won’t be talking about those here, since those are obtained after the book has found a publisher, and what I want to address here are the blurbs solicited before the book has found a publishing home. What I’ll be talking about here will be what I’ll call “pre-pub” blurbs, i.e., endorsements of the book before it has been sold to a publisher.There are differing thoughts on the value of blurbs. Some think they help sales and others think… they don’t. Personally, I think that simply from the fact that they exist, and are found on the vast majority of book jackets, is proof that at least the publisher feels they have value.And, this is usually how most of us view blurbs. As something that’s solicited after the book has found a publisher. However, there are a few agents and authors who feel that gathering endorsements before the manuscript has even been sent out to editors has value.I’m in that camp.And, so is my own agent.We both see endorsements from the right folks as being beneficial in not only selling a manuscript, but also in sometimes raising the amount of the advance and attention paid to the manuscript with the marketing departments of publishers.Tell me—which of two otherwise equally good manuscripts in the horror novel genre will get taken more seriously by publishers—one accompanied by a couple of paragraphs from Stephen King, saying this book is one of the scariest books he’s ever read? Or, the manuscript who doesn’t have a couple of paragraphs from Stephen King?Okay. That’s my argument for pre-pub blurbs…Until a few years ago, I didn’t realize there was even such a thing as a pre-pub blurb. I assumed, like probably most of us, that blurbs were only solicited after a publisher had purchased the book. An agent (whom I won’t name) showed me how he sold sports books, using this technique. He graciously sent me sample proposals for a number of sports books and always included in the proposals were pre-pub blurbs by renowned and respected sports figures. In fact, the blurbs were always the first thing the editor saw in the proposal. This guy sells just about all of his clients’ manuscripts and proposals and he’s quick to give a lot of credit to those blurbs. After all, if Curry Fitzpatrick and Bo Jackson give hosannas to a proposed book on baseball, who is going to resist at least giving that proposal a close read?The answer to that is as clear as the fact that Roseanne has kicked anorexia’s ass.Can everybody get pre-pub blurbs? Well… no. But, a lot of writers can—even previously unpublished authors. Don’t assume that just because you don’t have your first book out that you can’t.Psychology of endorsementsLet’s look at the psychology behind pre-pub blurbs first. Almost all of us—including seasoned editors and agents—have at least vestiges of uncertainty residing in our DNA. In other words, like all of us as human beings, we’re at least sometimes a bit unsure of our decisions. It’s why Michael Jordan made millions of dollars shilling for tennis shoes and cereal. It wasn’t because Fortune 500 CEO’s liked Mikey so much, they just wanted to shower him with dollar bills—it was because they’re well aware that the average citizen doesn’t really know what’s good and what isn’t. When a prominent person says they like something—even though we know he’s paid to say it—we take his word for it that it’s good and therefore we feel okay about plunking our money down.The same psychology works in book sales to editors. If you’ve written a thriller and are shopping it around to publishers and included in your sales pitch are blurbs written on its behalf by Lee Child, Joe Finder and Linwood Barclay, with what frame of mind do you think most editors will be in when they pick up the manuscript and begin reading page one? It’s already half-sold! Besides respecting these bestselling authors, the editor also knows the book already has gained blurbs for the book that the thriller audience is familiar with and respects as well. That’s an editor who is going to feel extremely confident when he presents the manuscript to his board. He already knows how accounting is going to view this bit of information. (With high-fives and spraying each other with bottles of Crystal…). In fact, there are a great number of… how should I say this?... “flawed” books that have become published, simply because it was endorsed by a brand name. That’s life. And, is an aspect of publishing many won’t talk about, but which exists. We can declaim against it as being unfair… or, we can use it to our advantage.Okay. So we’re aware that pre-pub blurbs can help sell a manuscript. Now. How do we get them?There are many ways. My agent is currently marketing two of my books. One is a proposal for a new writer’s how-to and one is a new novel. We’re using pre-pub blurbs for each.For those of you who’ve followed this blog for awhile, you already know how we’ve gotten pre-pub endorsements for my nonfiction book proposal, titled, A Fiction Writer’s Workshop at the Bijou. I asked for your blurbs on this site. And got a ton of ‘em. Thanks! I also asked others via email for the same and they’ve also been extremely generous in sending me blurbs. As of now, I have nearly thirty of them and you can bet they’re included in our sales pitch to publishers.This is one way. Many of you have blogs of your own—blog readerships you can ask the same of that I have. For a book such as this—a writer’s book—I received endorsements from the targeted audience—writers. Some of you were well-known authors yourselves and others were beginning writers. Blurbs from both sources work very well in this particular case.But, for my thriller manuscript, I couldn’t ask the same audience for endorsements. I had to go to other thriller writers. Fortunately, because I’ve been doing this for a long time (writing books), I’ve been on many panels at writer’s workshops and become friends with those appearing on the same panels. Years ago, for instance, I was on several such panels, made a presentation, and conducted a workshop at Henry Perez’ writer’s convention, the Midwest Literary Arts Festival in Aurora, Illinois. I sat on panels with such renowned names as James Rollins, Dennis Lehane, David Morrell, J.A.Konrath, Hallie Ephron, and many other well-known writers, too numerous to list here. (Best writer’s convention ever! Henry, if you’re reading this—make it happen again!) Because of that, I was able to solicit blurbs from Henry Perez and others for my thriller, The Bitch. Recently, I was asked to submit an article for John Schoenfelder’s website for his new imprint, Mulholland Books at Little, Brown. A week or so later, I read an article on the same website from author Joe Trigoboff. I wasn’t aware of Mr. Trigoboff or his work at the time, but what he said in the article led me to realize we shared many of the same views. I was able to track him down through his publicist and he was gracious enough to provide me with a blurb. (In return, I’m pre-blurbing his brilliant memoir, Rumble in Brooklyn).I’ve received other pre-blurbs for The Bitch from other contacts I’ve made over the years. I was a presenter the summer before last for both of the Writer’s Retreat Workshops in Erlanger, Kentucky. During one of the two WRW events, I met a bestselling author in attendance—Bob Stewart—who’s written several true crime bestsellers (No Remorse, et al) and we became friends. Bob was extremely gracious in providing a kick-ass blurb. A few years ago, Cortright McMeel founded Murdaland, a noir magazine, and he’d solicited me for a short story which appeared in the first issue. Cort sold his first novel to St. Martin’s, Short, which is forthcoming next month. He liked my work and voice and so I approached him for a pre-pub blurb. It’s coming on Monday. (And, Cort is going to be interviewed here in a few weeks.)Another of my blurbers is a close friend I went to school for my MFA with at Vermont College. He’s blurbed my work before and I’ve returned the favor. A great source for those of you who have writer friends from high school or college to solicit.I’m providing my own experiences in how I gathered pre-pub blurbs for the few reading this who’ve formed similar relationships with other writers. I suspect at least a few of you can do the same.Can everyone do this? Of course not. Some can, some can’t. Does that mean you have to be in the business forever and have a bunch of books out to get these kinds of endorsements? Again, the answer is, of course not. There are a variety of ways to garner endorsements from those whose words count with editors.I work with writers coaching them as they write their novels. One of my clients is a complete unknown as a writer. However, the novel she’s written—besides being absolutely brilliant—has a subject matter that makes it easy to solicit blurbs from prominent people. She’s a Jewish writer who has written a novel that shows, in a moving way, the story of a Palestinian. I can’t talk about it more than that at this point, but trust me—this is a book that I feel certain will not only become a best-seller, but also garner significant literary awards. I see a potential movie in her future as well. Because of its subject matter, its originality, and her marvelous voice, she’s getting blurbs from former presidents, from extremely prominent people both in the Arab-American and Jewish communities, and from famous people who just recognize a wonderful story, brilliantly told. She’s an unknown writer now, but she won’t be for long.Another client is in a writing group with prominent writers. He obtains great pre-pub blurbs from his fellow writers from the group.The point is, nearly everyone who has a good book has a way to garner pre-pub blurbs. I can’t tell you how to accomplish this in every case, but there usually is a way if you simply practice the same creativity you employed in writing your book with your marketing efforts.Nonfiction book proposals are, as a rule, infinitely easier to solicit such blurbs for. Depending on the subject matter, look at the “names” in that field and approach them. One of the reasons nonfiction proposals are easier to get people to blurb them are that the potential blurber only has to read a chapter or two and the chapter outline to see if it’s something they’d be comfortable in lending their name to. In other words, they don’t have to read that much!With novels, it’s a bit different. The potential blurber will almost always need to read the entire manuscript. All 416 pages! And, that’s a lot to ask of anyone, especially if the request comes from an unknown writer. To get a good blurber for a novel usually requires that the author have some kind of relationship with the person solicited. For many as-yet-unpublished writers, that’s almost impossible. But… there are ways.For example, if you’ve taken a class or workshop from someone known in the field, that’s perhaps a person you can approach. If—as in the case of my client—you’ve worked with that person on a professional level—you can probably ask them to provide a blurb.Here are a few things to consider when approaching someone for a pre-pub blurb:1. Only approach those who have genuine name-recognition in the genre or field you’re writing in—the kind of name that will attract buyers because of who they are and what they say.2. Always approach in a professional manner—be polite and don’t ever put them on the spot. Let them know that if they simply don’t want to, you don’t expect them to furnish you a reason for refusing. That a simple, “No thanks—I’ll have to pass” is fine. Many (most?)  writers just don’t have the time. Don’t ever make them feel as if you expect them to or you won’t be their friend anymore or won’t ever buy their books again! To blurb someone’s manuscript or nonfiction book proposal—especially one that hasn’t yet found a publisher—is a huge favor to ask of anyone! Be extremely thankful of anyone who will… and extremely understanding when they can’t or won’t.3. If they do agree to read your work, find out how they prefer to look at the work. For instance, one of my recent blurbers doesn’t work with computers. He prefers to read hard copy only. Since I’m the one asking the favor, I was delighted to spend almost fifty bucks to have a copy printed ($31.00), and mailed to him ($17.00). You should do the same. Make it comfortable and easy for them to read it and by no means ever expect them to pay for any part of the process. Don’t for just one example, send them something they have to sign for.4. Make sure they understand that after they’ve read your mss or proposal, that if they’re uncomfortable in providing an endorsement, you want them to know you don’t expect them to, for any reason. Make sure you mean this and that they know you mean this in the very beginning.5. Make sure you offer to return the favor if ever asked. And then, if asked, give them a good ‘un!6. Don’t solicit the wrong people for your project. For instance, even if you know Stephen King personally, don’t ask him to blurb your nonfiction cookbook proposal or romance novel. Even if he provides a blurb in such a case (unlikely), the editor reviewing your proposal or mss is going to have a hernia laughing… as he slips a rejection slip inside the envelop…7. If someone does agree to pre-blurb your mss or proposal, and furnishes a good one, ask him or her if they could recommend anyone else who might be willing to do the same. Networking works here as well. If they’re agreeable to furnish names for this, ask if they mind you using their name or will possibly furnish an introduction to that person.8. Allow them their own timeframe to read and write the blurb in. Don’t ever put pressure on them to furnish their endorsement by a certain time. If they ask, simply say you’d prefer it by (whatever date) and hope that’s okay with them, but if it isn’t, that’s fine. If you don’t receive it from them in time for marketing it, you can still probably use it once it’s sold. In fact, one of the assumptions blurbers will have is that their endorsement will appear in the book once published. While you can’t guarantee that (that’s the publisher’s decision), it probably will happen, especially if you’ve solicited the kind of blurber you should have—one that readers will know or respect because of who they are or what position they hold. Who are the only kinds of blurbers you should solicit in the first place.9. Always be gracious and professional in all of your dealings with potential endorsers.10. If you already have an agent, make sure he or she agrees with you that it’s okay to solicit blurbers. Some won’t be behind the idea and they will most likely have sound reasons for their view. Listen to your agent. And, some may be delighted that you’re going to try, but will want to help guide you as to who you solicit.Can everyone get pre-pub blurbs/endorsements? Not at all. But, some can and more can than may realize it.Please understand that this is a strategy that will work for some and won’t work for others. I just want to present it as a possibility you may not have considered that may help you in selling your novel or nonfiction book proposal.Did everyone I solicited give me a blurb? Nope. One thought The Bitch was too dark to lend his name to. A couple didn’t respond to my request. One would have, but has recently had a number of family issues he was dealing with and just didn’t have the time. One told me he was no longer giving blurbs to others. Some in my blanket solicitation of my book proposal for Bijou that I was hoping for didn’t respond.Just the way it goes. Like they say in sales: Every no gets you closer to a yes. And then there’s that thing about kissing a lot of frogs…Good luck!Hope this was of some help!Blue skies,LesP.S. It’s entirely possible that some disagree with this strategy and have good reasons for doing so. Hope to hear from you. Also, it’s entirely possible some agree with this strategy and have used it for their benefit. Hope to hear from you as well. One of my blurbers, Buddy..."},
{"title": "A LOOK AT A STUDENT'S WORK W/COMMENTS", "date": "Saturday, October 30, 2010", "text": "Hi folks,I thought perhaps a glimpse at one of my student’s work for the week and the comments I furnished him might prove useful to others undergoing the same struggle. I’ve changed the student’s name (to protect the guilty…)—I’ll call him “Ben”—and have his blessing to use this. He’s a terrific student in the best sense of the word. He started as a true beginner and while his fiction isn’t yet ready to be up for the National Book Award, it’s improved considerably in just a few weeks. He takes notice of everything and doesn’t just pay lip service to it, but goes out immediately and implements the lessons learned. Every single week he has gotten better and better, and you can’t ask for anything more of a student in any discipline. I’m proud to call him my student and I hope he’s equally proud to call me his teacher.I ask all of my students (and clients) to begin with a 15-20 word outline, to serve both as a road map for them on their novel journey and for me to be sure they’re delivering a sound structure for their novels.I also ask each of my students to comment on each other’s work. At the end of my own comments, I’m including those of one of Ben’s classmates, whom I’ll call “Brenda.” Many times (as in this case), other students come up with even better criticisms than I had as you’ll see.Here’s Ben’s story in progress:Inciting Incident: Davis gets caught getting high.Development:Davis enters treatment to save      marriage.Davis leaves treatment.Wife leaves with daughter.Davis reenters treatment to      win family back.Resolution:Davis loses wife but becomes a better father.The Second ChanceDavis had pretended to be asleep for nearly an hour. His mind tossed and turned but on the outside he remained motionless. When he heard his wife’s familiar snore, he inched backwards beneath the covers until he reached the edge of the bed. He slipped free of the bed and watched Michelle to be certain she hadn’t moved. He continued to watch for any movement and stepped backwards toward the door. Outside the room he began to walk with confidence. He headed down the hall and paused at his daughter’s room. Out of habit he peeked into the room to be certain that she was asleep. He could lose hours by the side of her crib. He loved to watch Samantha sleep—the way her lips moved, the way she smiled, the way she cooed—she was his little angel. He couldn’t watch her tonight though. He was a man on a mission. His eyes grew accustomed to the darkness. At the end of the hall he entered the living room and navigated the furniture. He reached behind the blinds, unlocked the sliding glass door, and slipped into the night. When he sat down in the comfort of his patio chair, he reached for the pack of cigarettes hidden behind the potted rose bush. He lit a cigarette and took a long, steady drag. He had anticipated getting high all day. He wanted to please his wife, but the 12-step meetings and sobriety chips did nothing for him. Tonight he was going to please himself.He set the cigarette in the ashtray and stuck his fingers back into the pack. He retrieved a small glass pipe and turned the pack upside down until a few tiny rocks fell into his hand. He put one into the pipe and lit the end until white smoke filled the chamber. He kept the flame steady and inhaled until his lungs were full. His ability to wait all day for this moment was the only proof he needed to convince himself he was in control. With the smoke in his lungs his body immediately began to feel the cocaine—a warm rush flooded through his veins and his body began to quiver. The first hit was always the best.But now his addiction was wide awake. He forgot that he was supposed to be in control and smoked a night’s worth of crack in less than half an hour.And the night had only just begun. He crept back into the house, grabbed some clothes and his keys, and snuck out the front door.He went to the ATM, the dealer’s house, and was home before midnight. He didn’t even stop to take a hit.He pulled into the driveway but something didn’t seem right. Oh shit—had he left the kitchen light on?He was stuck. Maybe he was just being paranoid. He tried to think of a story. But the door opened and there was Michelle—crack pipe in hand. “It’s over” she said. “I’m done with you.”“Baby…” he said. “Don’t baby me, you blew your last chance” she said.“Baby, it’s not what you think…” He started to recite his lie.“It’s not what I think? You’re not high? You didn’t choose drugs over your daughter? You didn’t choose drugs over me?” She threw the pipe at him. It bounced off his shoulder and landed on the passenger floor.“Baby, I messed up. I’m sorry.” He started to get out of the car. “No, I messed up by giving you another chance.” She pushed the car door closed. “Samantha will never see you high again.”“But baby…” he said. “I need my family. I love you.” He started to work up tears. “You love getting high” she said. “I won’t let you hurt us ever again.”“Baby, I’m sorry. I need you.” He continued the apology. “No, you need help. And I can’t help you anymore.”“What am I supposed to do?” He couldn’t hold back his tears. He hoped they would have their usual effect. They didn’t.“Check into treatment, check into the hospital” she said. “Be a man for once.”She walked into the house and slammed the door.He was mad at himself for getting caught. His tears failed and he wiped his eyes. He punched the dashboard and reached for his cell phone. She didn’t answer. He tried again. No answer.The pattern of arguments with his wife had been fairly consistent. She yelled, she screamed, she threw things at him. She complained about his selfishness, his weakness, his lack of concern for the marriage. The fighting would go on for hours and he would wind up sleeping on the couch. Something was different this time. Yeah. It didn’t go on for hours. It lasted maybe 25 seconds. Kidding, Ben, but also to illustrate a point. This really should be a bigger scene than it is. Don’t worry about it now—just keep going and come back to this on your first major rewrite. Not a bunch of arguing, which gets tedious quickly, but a scene where it’s developed more fully, instead of a “wham-bam, thank you, ma’am” kind of thing. Give us his thoughts as the scene progresses, that kind of thing. Make sense? Again, don’t address it now, but when you finish the novel, this is one of the places I’d go back and address.He thought about his options. He felt the world close in and knew she was right about treatment. He didn’t want to admit he was an addict. He didn’t want to admit he was out of control.He thumbed through the papers in the center console. He looked for the info he picked up at one of his meetings. It had numbers to a drug detox center and treatment facilities. Had he thrown it away? He looked through the trash on the floor until he found the crumpled paper. He couldn’t read the phone numbers scribbled on it and he turned on the dome light. He went through the motions and found the name of a man he recognized from one of the meetings. He wasn’t sure he was making the right move when he dialed the phone.“Hello,” a man’s voice said.“Is this Jessie?” he said.“Who wants to know?” the man said.“This is Davis. You gave me your number at one of the meetings.”“Cool. What’s up? How are you?” Jessie said.“Not well, my (Comma splice.) wife caught me getting high.”“Guess you relapsed, huh? The idea is to call someone before you pick up,” Jessie said.“I fucked up. I need to get into treatment or my wife is through with me.” “Do you want to get clean?” Jessie said. “Are you willing to do what it takes?”“I need to, I don’t have a choice, can you help me?” (Two comma splices here.)“Hold on, I’ll call you right back.” He looked at his phone to make sure the ringer was on and stepped out of his car. The front door was locked and when he opened it he realized the latch was in place. How many times had he broken the latch to get in when he was intoxicated? Tonight this didn’t seem like a good idea.“Baby, please let me in,” he said. His face pressed against the door. The light came on.“Go away! I swear I’ll call the police on you.” Her response was cold.“Baby, I’m on the phone with a friend from the program. I need you and Sam, just give me a chance.”“Don’t talk to me again until you’re sober.” She slammed the door close and bolted it. The kitchen light went out.He put his head into his hands and sighed. He started pacing in the driveway. His phone rang, it was Jessie.“There’s a bed for you at detox if you’re interested,” Jessie said. “Are you drunk or just high?”“High,” he said. “How does detox work?”“Have a few drinks so you’ve got liquor in your system. They’ll keep you for a couple of days and work to find you the best treatment options.” He’s telling him to drink? Would a person interested in helping him say this? This just doesn’t ring true. I imagine most readers are going to be thinking the same thing, so I’d address this. If Jesse has some kind of reason for this advice, I’d give it. In fact, I’d think Davis himself would want to know why he’s advising him to get drunk and ask him. Make sense?Jessie gave him directions and offered to pick him up.“Thanks, I can find it,” he said. He hung up the phone with a plan in place. The crack in his pocket had been calling to him throughout this ordeal. He could finally respond to that call.He dialed his wife one more time. He knew she wouldn’t answer but his plan was to leave a message anyway.“Baby, I love you and Sam and am going to do everything right this time. I am on my way to detox and they’ll help me find the treatment I need. Please have faith in me.”He turned the dome light back on and found the crack pipe she threw at him. It was intact.He knew exactly what he should do. His addiction knew exactly what he would do. He turned on his car, put it into reverse, and pulled out of the driveway. He followed Jessie’s instructions and made a beeline to get some booze. A couple miles later he pulled into the drive-thru at the liquor store.            “A 12-pack of Budweiser, a pint of Jack Daniels, and a pack of Camel filters in the box.” He reached for his wallet and pulled out some bills.             He broke the seal of the Jack Daniels bottle with his teeth before he pulled out of the parking lot.            “At least you love me.” He took a long swig. Several miles later he pulled his car into Falcon Park. No one was around so he parked the car and turned off the ignition.             “Now where was I…” he He cracked open a cold beer and reached for his crack pipe. He settled into the routine of hit, swig, drink a beer. Occasionally(,) he broke up the routine with a cigarette.            Halfway through the bottle the remaining beers started to get warm. He decided to take one last hit and head towards detox. He looked at his cell phone. No calls. The drugs and the alcohol weren’t doing their job. His wife was really mad at him this time and he wished he could go home. “I’ve got to set things right.” Ben, this is the second time you’ve got him talking out loud to himself. I’d try to avoid that kind of thing. A guy talking to himself comes across as a kind of loon. I’d just have him think it.Ben, you’ve come an incredibly long way since we started and should be extremely proud of yourself. The problem you need to attack now is that while this is written so much better, there’s just no sense of urgency or tension to it. It’s coming across as mostly a “sort of” bad situation for Davis and not much of a sense of this being a life-altering event for him. Sentences like: His wife was really mad at him this time and he wished he could go home serve to render this as merely a “bad day at the office” kind of thing. We don’t see any desperation, much of anything besides a kind of ennui or mild frustration.This is one of those tough parts of writing. At this stage, I suspect you’re still learning the difference between melodrama and drama and it’s a steep learning curve. For instance, characters arguing isn’t usually drama at all—it’s mostly tiresome and melodramatic. But, until a writer learns the many nuances of how to impart emotion, it seems to be the only choice. How does one overcome that? By reading people who do it well and appropriate their techniques. I’m going to share a story beginning in a bit to show you what I mean.First, a great way to infuse this with drama and make his inciting incident ring true and impact the reader emotionally, is to show the depths of his addiction. If you do that, then it doesn’t take much of a scene between him and his wife to complete the inciting incident.Here’s a story beginning showing a guy in the throes of addiction that do just that. This is from John Sandford’s Easy Prey. It begins:            When the first man woke up that morning, he wasn’t thinking about killing anyone. He woke up with a head full of blues, a brain that was too big for his skull, and a bladder about to burst. He lay with his eyes closed, breathing across a tongue that tasted like burnt chicken feathers. The blues rolled in through the bedroom door.            Coming down hard.            He had been flying on cocaine for three days, getting everything done, everything. Then last night, coming down, he’d stopped at a liquor store for a bottle of Stolichnaya. His bleeding brain retained a picture of himself lifting the bottle off the shelf, and another picture of an argument with the counterman, who didn’t want to break a hundred-dollar bill.            By that time, the coke high had become unsustainable; and the Stoli had been a bad idea. There was no smooth landing after a three-day toot, but the vodka turned a wheels-up belly landing into a full crash-and-burn. Now he’d pay. If you peeled open his skull and dumped it, he thought, his brain would look like a coagulated lump of Campbell’s bean soup.            He cracked his eyes, lifted his head, and looked at the clock. A fewminutes past seven. He’d gotten four hours of sleep. Par for the course with coke, and the Stoli hadn’t helped. If he’d stayed down for ten hours, or twelve—he needed about sixteen to catch up—he might have been past the worst of it. Now he was just gonna have to suck it up.            He turned to his left, where a woman, a dishwater blonde, lay facedown in her pillow. He could only see about half of her head; the rest was buried by a red fleece blanket. She lay without moving, like a dead woman—but no such luck. He closed his eyes again, and there was nothing left in the world but the blues music bumping in from the next room, from the all-blues channel, nine-hundred-and-something on the TV dial. Must’ve left it on last night…And so on. See how we’re into this guy’s head and into his addiction at the very beginning? This is what you’re missing. We’re kind of “told” he’s a crack addict, but since we don’t get a very good account of how that addiction impacts him, we don’t feel anything emotionally. Picture Sandford’s opening here and then picture how you can use something like this in yours. This is what writers do—we steal techniques. Why it’s so important to read widely and avidly.Also, look at how a master like Sandford uses original language to convey an image. “Tasted like burnt chicken feathers.” “His bleeding brain.” “Woke with a head full of blues.” “Blues music bumping in from the next room.” There are more, but these few give you the idea. While a nonwriter might look at a guy suffering from addiction and just see a guy nodding off, Sandford gets us inside the guy and delivers how he’s feeling and suffering with wonderful, wonderful language. At the end of reading this, is there any doubt this guy has a jones?He also begins with the very first sentence, promising trouble about to happen, with:When the first man woke up that morning, he wasn’t thinking about killing anyone.This is the kind of thing to work on, Ben. Painting a picture with words. Delivering emotion. Showing Davis as an addict, not telling us. Not writing a scene just showing the character’s actions. That’s screenwriting, not fiction.Hope this helps!Read, read, and read some more… and then steal the stuff that works.Blue skies,LesNow—here’s Ben's fellow classmate Brenda’s take on his work:The Second ChanceDavis pretended to be asleep for nearly an hour.

Not just crack?Tonight he was going to please himself.He set the cigarette in the ashtray and stuck his fingers back into the pack.

You’re doing a lot of telling and not much showing. I’m not feeling like I’m getting a lot from him personally. A lot of this so far is reading somewhat impersonally. How can you make this seem more real to us? What details can you give?And the night had only just begun. He crept back into the house, grabbed some clothes and his keys, and snuck out the front door.He went to the ATM, the dealer’s house, and was home before midnight. He didn’t even stop to take a hit.He pulled into the driveway but something didn’t seem right. Oh shit—had he left the kitchen light on? See, here feels personal. He’s asking himself something. Much of the above feels like reporter-mode.He was stuck. Maybe he was just being paranoid. He tried to think of a story. But the door opened and there was Michelle—crack pipe in hand. “It’s over,” she said. “I’m done with you.” “Baby…” he said. “Don’t baby me, you blew your last chance,” she said. You need commas at the end of dialogue that would typically end in a period.“Baby, it’s not what you think…” He started to recite his lie.“It’s not what I think? You’re not high? You didn’t choose drugs over your daughter? You didn’t choose drugs over me?” She threw the pipe at him. It bounced off his shoulder and landed on the passenger floor. “Baby, I messed up. I’m sorry.” He started to get out of the car. Sorry, but so far the dialogue is reading like every cliché stereotype of this scene I’ve heard of. How can you make it more unique? Less expected? More lifelike?“No, I messed up by giving you another chance.” She pushed the car door closed. “Samantha will never see you high again.”“But baby…” he said. “I need my family. I love you.” He started to work up tears. I don’t believe him. I believe her, even though her speech is wooden and predictable. There isn’t enough internalization of his thoughts on their loss for me to believe he’s sad or in any way moved by the conversation. Hmm. You weren’t getting the comma/punctuation thing earlier, so let’s try this way.“You love getting high, YOU NEED COMMA HERE” she said. “I won’t let you hurt us ever again.”“Baby, I’m sorry. I need you.” He continued the apology. Still not believing him. There’s no heart here. No feelings, no emotions to be read. So far, he’s reading like a robot, and she like a bad soap opera actress.“No, you need help. And I can’t help you anymore.”“What am I supposed to do?” He couldn’t hold back his tears. He hoped they would have their usual effect. They didn’t.“Check into treatment, check into the hospital, YOU NEED COMMA HERE” she said. “Be a man for once.” Okay. Now here is some personality. You need a lot more of it. For her, for him. Etc.She walked into the house and slammed the door.I think you’re struggling with something I used to a few years ago. Setting emotions on the page. So far, there’s no real thought process. No vulnerability. Nothing relatable to this fellow. If you want us to sympathize with him, you gotta let us in on what he’s thinking. What his thought process is. You’ve got to show us the internal struggle. Addiction is all about internal struggle. Weighing the pros against the cons, and doing what feels good. You aren’t showing us any of that struggle with him. In fact, he seems so utterly disconnected from his actions, his dialogue and his setting, that it’s almost like he’s operating on a totally separate wavelength that we don’t have access to. Which is bad for your reader, because they’ll never make the necessary connection with him in order to keep reading. He needs redeeming features. Internalization goes a long way in helping with that.He was mad at himself for getting caught. His tears failed and he wiped his eyes. He punched the dashboard and reached for his cell phone. She didn’t answer. He tried again. No answer.The pattern of arguments with his wife had been fairly consistent. She yelled, she screamed, she threw things at him. She complained about his selfishness, his weakness, his lack of concern for the marriage. The fighting would go on for hours and he would wind up sleeping on the couch. Something was different this time. Here’s some internalization. But it’s not enough and not soon enough. You need to launch into his thoughts a lot earlier than this.He thought about his options. He felt the world close in and knew she was right about treatment. He didn’t want to admit he was an addict. He didn’t want to admit he was out of control.He thumbed through the papers in the center console. He looked for the info he picked up at one of his meetings. It had numbers to a drug detox center and treatment facilities. Had he thrown it away? He looked through the trash on the floor until he found the crumpled paper. He couldn’t read the phone numbers scribbled on it and he turned on the dome light. He went through the motions and found the name of a man he recognized from one of the meetings. He wasn’t sure he was making the right move when he dialed the phone.“Hello,” a man’s voice said.“Is this Jessie?” he said.“Who wants to know?” the man said.“This is Davis. You gave me your number at one of the meetings.”“Cool. What’s up? How are you?” Jessie said.“Not well, my wife caught me getting high.”I like this guy’s dialogue. He sounds real. You need to spread that goodness all around.“Guess you relapsed, huh? The idea is to call someone before you pick up, YOU NEED COMMA HERE” Jessie said.“I fucked up. I need to get into treatment or my wife is through with me.” “Do you want to get clean?” Jessie said. “Are you willing to do what it takes?”“I need to. I don’t have a choice. Can you help me?”“Hold on. I’ll call you right back.” He looked at his phone to make sure the ringer was on and stepped out of his car. The front door was locked and when he opened it he realized the latch was in place. Can you show us this without directly reporting it from his eyes? What did it look like? What sound did it make? How many times had he broken the latch to get in when he was intoxicated? Tonight this didn’t seem like a good idea. Ah. It took a second to make the connection that this is his own house. You need to tell us that a bit sooner.“Baby, please let me in,” he said. His face pressed against the door. The light came on.“Go away! I swear I’ll call the police on you.” Her response was cold. Really? Cuz with that explanation point, it sounds more angry than cold.“Baby, I’m on the phone with a friend from the program. I need you and Sam, just give me a chance.” Technically, a lie. The dude hung up. He’s waiting for a call back, right?“Don’t talk to me again until you’re sober.” She slammed the door close and bolted it. The kitchen light went out.He put his head into his hands and sighed. He started pacing in the driveway. His phone rang, it was Jessie.“There’s a bed for you at detox if you’re interested,” Jessie said. “Are you drunk or just high?”“High,” he said. “How does detox work?” He doesn’t already know? Hasn’t he be going to meetings? Don’t they talk about how things like that work?“Have a few drinks so you’ve got liquor in your system. They’ll keep you for a couple of days and work to find you the best treatment options.”Jessie gave him directions and offered to pick him up.“Thanks, I can find it,” he said. He hung up the phone with a plan in place. The crack in his pocket had been calling to him throughout this ordeal. He could finally respond to that call.He dialed his wife one more time. He knew she wouldn’t answer but his plan was to leave a message anyway.“Baby, I love you and Sam and am going to do everything right this time. I am on my way to detox and they’ll help me find the treatment I need. Please have faith in me.” I’m not buying this instanteous “Oops. Shit, I got caught. But ho-hum, I’m immediately off to detox because you’re pissed and I want to appease you. Diddly-dee, Here I am at Detox. Surely, this will not make her mad at me anymore.” Does this make any sense to you?He turned the dome light back on and found the crack pipe she threw at him. It was intact.He knew exactly what he should do. His addiction knew exactly what he would do. Here’s some of that internal struggle I was talking about. But it’s not enough. Stretch it out. What does everything mean to him? We need a longer thought-process.He turned on his car, put it into reverse, and pulled out of the driveway. He followed Jessie’s instructions and made a beeline to get some booze. A couple miles later he pulled into the drive-thru at the liquor store. Okay. This makes no sense. The guy said it’d be okay to show up high. Now he thinks that’s an excuse to show up drunk AND high? Even if it doesn’t make good sense to us, you need to make us believe that HE thinks it’s a good idea. Otherwise, we’re too lost in disbelief.            “A 12-pack of Budweiser, a pint of Jack Daniels, and a pack of Camel filters in the box.” He reached for his wallet and pulled out some bills.             He broke the seal of the Jack Daniels bottle with his teeth before he pulled out of the parking lot.            “At least you love me.” He took a long swig. Several miles later he pulled his car into Falcon Park. No one was around so he parked the car and turned off the ignition.             “Now where was I…” he cracked open a cold beer and reached for his crack pipe. He settled into the routine of hit, swig, drink a beer. Occasionally he broke up the routine with a cigarette. Why did he even call the guy for a room if he was joe-cool with hanging out intoxicated in his car? We need to see HIS logic behind this. Help us make sense out of it. Even it’s a comforting reaction, to make the loss of his wife feel less painful. I can understand that logic. Maybe even relate. But unless you give us a reason for why he does what he does, everything he does will seem nonsensical.            Halfway through the bottle the remaining beers started to get warm. He decided to take one last hit and head towards detox. He looked at his cell phone. No calls. The drugs and the alcohol weren’t doing their job. His wife was really mad at him this time and he wished he could go home. “I’ve got to set things right.”            Hi Ben.I’m not really sure what to add that I didn’t already mention above. Really think about your character’s logic and the motivations they have as to why they’re acting the way they do. Even if what they’re doing seems stupid or illogical, as long as they have a reason that makes sense to them, more often than not, the reader will follow along with them.Hope this helped! –BrendaAs you can see, we’ve got some sharp students in class! They’re all like this, believe me. There are about ten left in class (we started with more, but as always happens, some can’t stand the heat in the kitchen so they… relocate. Which makes the class really work well.) I could have included all the rest of the class’s comments, but Brenda’s is fairly representative.What this does is give each writer ten teachers instead of one. And, as you can see, they don’t provide “pitty-patty” feel-good comments, but tough, intelligent ones, delivered with good manners and in a spirit of helping each other get better. They’re all committed to becoming good writers who will have a solid chance at getting published eventually as a result of what they learn, and they take no quarter. And, everyone accepts the others’ criticism. It’s never delivered maliciously or to show that they know more than the other person, but always in the spirit of helping out a fellow writer. We have no competition in class. We feel there’s room for everyone to get published and a fellow writer’s success is only going to help other writers. There’s also no competition for grades as I abolish them at the beginning. They know at the very beginning that their grade doesn’t depend on how good they are or how brilliant or bad their writing may be. There are only two things that are required: that they show up each week and that they try their best. If they do that, their writing will get better. And, they get that A, which is the least of their motivations.Another thing that's important to know. Students don't wait for me to send my comments before they make their own. And, I don't read theirs before I post mine. It wasn't until after I'd posted my comments on Ben's work to the class that I read Brenda's comments. Which means she hadn't read mine, since they hadn't been posted yet. None of the class members are trying to cue in on what I said and vice versa. We all have faith in each other to make our own judgments, independent of each other.  I love my classes! They’re always composed of great students. It makes me feel so good to get the same compliment each class at the end of it. It always goes something like this (this is from an actual email I got and is similar to many others I’ve received): “I never worked so hard in any class I’ve ever taken as I have in this one. I’ve taken other classes and all I ever get is some faint praise—‘this works well’ or ‘I like this’—and it’s obvious the instructor didn’t spend much time really looking at my work. I’ll get comments I can see are designed to make me feel good, but they don’t since there’s no thought behind it other than to… make me feel good. You give very little praise, but it’s always earned and I value it more than all the ‘you write description well’ kinds of “compliments” I usually get.”Well, it makes me feel good also to know that they earned every bit of the praise I’m admittedly stingy about giving out. People want to know they’ve actually earned their blue ribbons, I think. My writers have. Just a wild-eyed teacher..."},

The following is what I gave as my graduating talk at Vermont College upon graduating with my MFA in Writing degree in 1997. I thought perhaps it was a particularly timely post for today. In fact, if you didn't know it was written over a decade ago, you might think I just dashed it off today...One of the faculty, Pam Painter, told me she'd taught at VC since the very beginning and that the audience for my talk was the single biggest ever, for student or faculty. We not only filled the main hall, there were people gathered in the entrances into the room and all along the stairs leading to the second floor. I kind of had the reputation for saying things that upset some folks and that other folks liked, and this kind of proved out that, as when it ended, I received comments from both ends of the spectrum. That made me happy. No expression of an idea is any good if everyone is in agreement with. That usually means... it sucks.Bring popcorn. It's a long one...CENSORSHIP AND WHY I LOVE CHARLES BUKOWSKIByLeslie H. Edgerton(Lecture Delivered to MFA in Writing Students & Faculty at Vermont College, January 8, 1997)          Like most of you in this room, I’ve always written, always had to write. I had this thing inside me that said I had to be a writer. Notice, I said had to be. Not “wanted” or “yearned to be”. Had to be. There was no choice in the matter. God looked down and saw this little runty red thing laying in his bassinet, sucking down a PBR with a formula chaser, and He said, “I need another writer for my Grand Scheme,” and Bingo! There I was. A writer. When God Himself says you’re gonna be a writer, then, boy, you better be a writer. You play the hand you’re dealt.          I didn’t have any argument with that. I mean, who argues with God? Except, maybe Francois Camoin. But I didn’t have the advantage of being French and cynical and all that like Francois did- I didn’t even know where to begin to buy a beret or a black painter’s smock or an attitude. I mean, for Christ’s sake, I was a kid in Texas. None of those things could be gotten in Texas. If you couldn’t barbecue it or shoot it, fuck it or ride it, forget it. Not available west of the Pecos.          So I had to be a writer who grew up in Texas and my opportunities were pretty limited because of that.          Unfortunately, I was the product of a traditional American education. I say “unfortunately” because the literature I was exposed to in that system included what might be termed “safe” writers. Thackery, Milton, Shakespeare, Melville, Whitman, Steinbeck, Faulkner...you know the list. It’s the list we’ve all been exposed to.          I tried. Believe me, I tried. But my models for writing were all wrong, in a way. They were guys like Balzac and Dickens, Henry James and Jonathon Swift. Ladies like Louisa May Alcot. Great writers, sure, but from another planet as far as I was concerned. I grew up in a bar, saw my first man killed when I was twelve - shot six feet in front of me. I was the night dispatcher for my grandmother’s cab company when that happened and had to phone the police. Nothing like that ever happened in Little Women, near as I could tell.          One by one, I tried all the genres and styles I became exposed to and one thing or the other doomed each experiment. I mean, I loved the books I read and of course I tried imitating them in style and content, but even though they were wonderful books, they weren’t about worlds I inhabited. I guess I assumed you weren’t allowed to write about the planet I happened to find myself on.          I just didn’t realize you were allowed to write about real life, at least life as I knew it. It was my first brush with censorship, although I didn’t know it. Our local public library, which was my only source of reading material just didn’t carry anything in the contemporary realism category. Looking back, I know now the head librarian hauncho probably felt those kinds of books would damage my tender and developing character, so even if they had such books on their shelves, they were kept from youngsters like myself.          So, for years, I continued writing what I thought was the only kind of stuff that could get published and little by little became more and more disillusioned with writing and literature in general. Perhaps if I had gone to college at an earlier age, I might have discovered there were books out there to which I could relate, but I didn’t. I was in the Navy and then in prison, and in those kinds of environments you just don’t run across literature that’s much different than what you’d find on your average high school English recommended reading list.          I quit writing for a number of years, because, frankly, I was bored. It was by chance only that I came upon a writer who relit the literary fires.          Charles Bukowski.          Wow.          Lights went off.          This guy was doing things I didn’t know you were allowed to do. He was writing about life, about real life. Nitty-gritty, down and dirty life. Lots of it was funny, most of it was sad, but it all touched me, way down deep there in that literary G-spot all writers (and readers) are forever trying to connect with.          I read another guy about the same time that turned me on fire inside as well. Kurt Vonnegut. I read this interview in the Paris Review in which he said, “Literature should not disappear up its own asshole, so to speak.” Big spark of understanding there. Ol’ Kurt said exactly what I had been unable to articulate for a long time, ever since I started reading the “masters.” The old boys (and girls) had some good stuff going for them, but it seems like literary sphincterism had set in by the time I came along, all these deified contemporary writers were sitting around contemplating their own navels, it seemed. I was reading all this stuff about upper-middle class angst. Really jazzy stuff, like how some guy was sorrowing because all he had out of life was his Chrysler agency and ten million bucks and was searching his soul and was in this big blue funk because he hadn’t gone off with Easy Sally that time at the senior prom way back in H.S. Every book I picked up at that period seemed to have a similar theme. I just couldn’t identify. Hell, I never was able to afford a used Chrysler, let alone an entire agency, and I had run off with Easy Sally--yeah, I was that guy, the one in the leather jacket and the slicked-back hair--really! I had hair, back then--and believe me there isn’t a lot of angst to be used for material in the writing trade when you’re sitting in the trailer and Easy Sally is looking like Even Easier Sally and you don’t know where your next PBR is coming from and the TV is flashing those little tornado warnings across the bottom of the screen and you’re trying to quiet the little rascal on your knee that has your last name but the propane delivery man’s hook nose. I just knew somewhere deep inside my bones I couldn’t fake writing a whole, entire book out of what it meant to be the Executive Vice President in Charge of Sales for Southeastern Florida for the Tidy Bowl Corp and sorrowing over the lost babe of his childhood or the sad fact that he’d chucked it all and gone off to paint Tahitian sunsets. Or that his wife had. Crap like that.          All of a sudden, here’s this guy Bukowski writing about shit I knew about. About whores and hustlers, winos and fathead bosses who were always worried their wives would go to bed with the help so they got their mad out in the open right away.          I picked up a book of his, a collection of stories called “The Most Beautiful Woman in Town and Other Stories.” I loved those other stories. It was like sitting down with a homeboy or your rap partner in the joint and swapping lies. Better yet; it was entertaining. All of a sudden, I remembered why I had first started writing. To make someone laugh. Or cry. Learn something about another human being. Just feel something. Feel what I was feeling. Here was this guy, Bukowski, and he was doing exactly what I’d always wanted to do.          Bukowski’s stories weren’t about middle-aged English professors who were all in a fret because their wives no longer get excited sitting around listening to them conjugate French verbs and deducing that their lives, the meaningful portions of them, anyway, were over. Some of these guys, it seemed, took 400 pages to figure out why the major babe in their life was leaving. They were bored, Jack.*                                               *                                               *          I know this was billed as a lecture on censorship and you may be wondering where the censorship angle comes in. Well, where it comes in is that not only were folks like Bukowski not being published by so-called “respectable” presses in this country, but other books by writers like him were not generally available to people like myself. They weren’t talked about by our English teachers, they weren’t on the shelves of our hometown libraries--or if they were, they were kept from our view and knowledge. In other words, there was a form of censorship operating that kept this kind of book from me and others that exists today and it is this and other forms of censorship, overt and covert, that I’ll get to, by and by. I want to show what it is about Bukowski that turned my whole life around. Well, not my life--I mean, I still have to mow the grass on Saturday and take out the garbage--but this story saved my writing life, which is, after all, the only life worth having.          The story was The Fiend. You may have read it. If you did, you either became a fan of Bukowski’s or you hated his guts. Personally, I became a fan.          Basically, it’s a story about a middle-aged guy named Martin Blanchard, who’s been defeated by alcohol. He’s lost his wife and family, two wives, two families, actually, his job, everything. Twenty-seven jobs he’s gone through. That’s a lot of jobs. This guy’s just your basic average slob who can’t leave the juice alone. He’s reduced to living in this squalid apartment, four flights up, and drinking wine. His only source of income is his unemployment checks and money left in parking meters. Badly educated, yet he listens to classical music, preferring Mahler.          He begins to notice this little girl outside playing. He begins to notice she has on these interesting panties...and... you guessed it, he finds himself masturbating. Afterwards, he feels relief. It’s out of my mind, he thinks after he gets off. I’m free again. Only, he’s not. It’s just the beginning of a new obsession, a perversion. For the first time in months, perhaps years, he has an interest. It repels him, but he can’t resist it, either.          At first, he thinks it’s just something weird that overtook him and now it’s out of his system, but after he drinks his last bottle of wine, he sees the little girl outside in the street and begins to get hard again. He decides to go to the store to replenish his wine supply and as he walks outside he notices the little girl and the two little boys have gone into the garage across the street. He finds himself walking into the garage behind them and shutting the doors.          He then proceeds to rape the little girl, in very graphic detail. When you read this part, if it doesn’t make you sick, you’re probably beyond the kind of help counseling can give you at this late date. All the while he’s committing this heinous act, the two boys are asking him questions. They express genuine curiosity and don’t seem to be overly-frightened, exhibiting more of an amoral attitude than anything. Bukowski does something quite skillful here. Instead of having the two young boys be scared shitless, he shows them to be mainly curious about what Martin is doing to their friend. These kids are witnessing something pretty horrible, but then they’re just kids, and there’s an amoral innocence about their reaction that blurs the morality. Raping a child is without doubt a truly horrible crime, with no redemption in such an act, but since it’s hard to wholeheartedly condemn the two boys the reader is moved into an area of moral ambiguity that creates a kind of complicity with the boys. The reader then becomes, like the boys, a kind of voyeur to Martin’s act. This also helps humanize the monster Martin is, inasmuch as any such person could be seen as having human qualities.          The kicker for me in this story was a line a little earlier on in the story, as Martin is kissing the child, just before he rapes her, and the narrator says, “Martin’s eyes looked into her eyes and it was a communication between two hells--one hers, the other his.” When I read this line, it was as if I’d been struck by literary lightening.          What I have always thought good writing was about was people, all kinds of folks, and what made writing about people good, was that it showed you something about them. Something you didn’t know or were confused on or were ignorant of. And not just politically correct folks, either. In fact, preferably not politically correct folks. Is there a more boring bunch in the Solar System? You see, I was in jail, I was an alcoholic, I was a drug user, I was all those kinds of dudes that aren’t allowed to buy a house in Westchester County--well, that’s not right, exactly, according to my New York friends, most of the citizens in Westchester fit that description--but you know what I mean--and I knew they weren’t all weak or stupid or worthless. They didn’t all start out that way. Something happened along the road. Some of the most intellectual conversations I’ve ever heard were in soup kitchens. I met a guy once who used to teach physics at M.I.T., one fine Thanksgiving Day at the free turkey blowout the Salvation Army was hosting in Baltimore. This guy could make hydrogen bombs in his sleep and probably cure cancer if he got a year off the sauce.          Anyway, back to Bukowski and his story about the child rapist. Bukowski doesn’t excuse this motherfucker, nor make him out to be anything but the monster he is, but he does show us something about the guy which we probably wouldn’t have known in any other way. He shows us there’s a human being running around inside the guy someplace. A somewhat troubled human being, but one of us at any rate. And this is what literature should be all about. Showing us to one another. The good, the bad, the ugly as well as the downright perverts.          All his stuff isn’t good. In fact, a lot of it stinks. Kind of masturbation-on-the-page type of stuff. He considers himself a genius--well, he is, actually--and Bukowski seems to have thought that everything he had a thought on was important because it came out of his brain. Not true. That virtually everything he wrote got printed may not have been his fault, but more the fault of publishers who bought into his self-created myth.          Almost any other writer that this same story would have occurred to, would have taken the point of view of anyone but Martin’s. The little girl herself, the boys, the cops who came and arrested him, the parents. An adult who discovered the crime. A fly on the wall. To write this kind of story from the pov of the perp, in my mind, is the stuff of literary courage. It’s very dangerous stuff. It you don’t bring it off, it almost makes the writer appear as if he excused Martin for what he’s done, which would have made Bukowski an even bigger monster than his character. What he’s been able to do is present Martin exactly as he is - a hideous member of the human race...but amazingly, yet...still a member of humanity. It’s interesting in one respect, too, in that Bukowski wrote this story in the third person, while most of his other writing is first person and confessional autobiography. It looks as if he wanted to make sure readers didn’t confuse the narrator with the author, which, if he did, renders him just a little less courageous. I don’t want to think of him that way, so I’ll give him the benefit of the doubt.          With that one little sentence, “Martin’s eyes looked into her eyes and it was a communication between two hells--one hers, the other his.”, Bukowski gives us an insight that is deeply profound. And that, in my opinion, is what great writing is all about.          It takes enormous courage to be able to write about the kinds of people Bukowski does. Readers, even intelligent readers, tend to associate the writer with the narrator. In my first semester, I wrote a story about a character who was a criminal, and I had the concern that the reader of the piece would want to know if I had been a criminal myself. I addressed my concern to my first advisor here, Phyllis Barber, and she said, “an intelligent reader will never ask if a piece of writing is autobiographical, so don’t worry about it.” Well, Phyllis meant well, and in a perfect world, this would be true, but believe me, even very intelligent readers at least wonder if the stuff they’re reading comes from the writer’s own experience and even the brightest of readers will wonder if very negative or dark stuff is what the author really thinks and feels. It’s just human nature. It’d be nice if readers accepted work labeled as fiction as just that--fiction--but the truth of the matter is, there’s something of the prurient in all of us that makes us hope that the stuff on the page--especially the dark, forbidden stuff--is derived from the real experience of its creator. It gives most of us a delicious little shiver of horror to be standing this close to depravity without actually having to get any of it on ourselves. There is some part of almost all our souls that craves the darker side of life. We are alternately titillated and repulsed by immoral behavior and I think that is the reason books and stories and movies about bad guys are so well-attended. We can satisfy this baser part of our souls in a safe and acceptable manner, so long as they get put in their places in the end.          Most of my own writing output has been about such people, and without exception, those who read it and are acquainted with me, will come up and ask, in almost an embarrassed fashion, “Was that yourself you were writing about?” Up until just recently, I would usually answer that, uh, no, I just know some people like that. I’ve usually taken the coward’s way out. Just recently, I’ve begun to admit that, yes, I’ve done many of the things that show up in my stories. I’ve been a criminal, done time, sold drugs, been involved in various sexual aberrations, broken many and diverse laws. I don’t do them any more--well, not as many--I’d be room temperature by now if I’d continued doing some of the things I used to. And, I’m a different person than I was when I was involved in those things. That’s why I’ve usually lied when asked if the author of my work was the same as the narrator. Most folks, no matter what they say, will assume you’re still that kind of person and that kind of reputation will keep you from getting some of the nicer rewards of our civilization.          The thing that writers like Bukowski represent to me is truth. As a group of animals endowed with a superior intellect--as compared with, say, monkeys or tse-flies--and if we do indeed have this intelligence, then what we ought to be about primarily is the pursuit of truth. This is what education should be about, although sadly, it seems not to be the Holy Grail it once was. Back in “my day” which was the nineteen-sixties, that’s what a lot of us were interested in. Truth. We were into toppling institutions. Institutions we felt were based on lies. And, I guess that’s why writers like Bukowski appeal to me so much. The one thing we weren’t being in the sixties was safe. Although, that’s not entirely true. There was a large contingent of folks that were concerned mainly with making sure they didn’t go to Vietnam and get shot at. A lot of the hyperbole in that era was, in fact, centered around changing a system that could put one’s physical unit in jeopardy. But for many of us, especially those of us who had been in the military at the time, the things we were involved in were anything but safe. That’s what seems to be missing today. Most of the stuff I pick up and read, while quite good in many instances, is for the most part, safe writing. The mood has changed, as it always does, but the direction it has moved to is a dangerous one.          I’m speaking here of the phenomenon sweeping through this country referred to as being “politically correct.” Like many grandiose ideas, there is a noble intent at the center of this outlook, but also like many other popular notions, it has been perverted until it is the antithesis of what it originated as. Being PC nowadays amounts to out and out censorship in my opinion. For every writer like Bukowski, William Vollmann, and David Sedaris who breaks through and becomes a cult hero, there are hundreds of writers who are being stifled, vilified, and destroyed, simply because they do not preach the party’s message nor do they conform to the parameters set up by the PC folks who seem to be in charge. Too often they are stifling themselves by trying to placate society. What used to be considered simply bad taste nowadays takes on a more sinister connotation and that is dangerous if we value freedom of thought and value the time-honored tradition of the debate of ideas which is the only viable method for advancing knowledge and understanding.          Plato himself spoke about political correctness in The Republic, when he said:          “Then the first thing will be to establish a censorship of the writers of fiction, and let the censors receive any tale of fiction which is good, and reject the bad; and we will desire mothers and nurses to tell their children the authorized ones only.” How about that.          In another of Bukowski’s stories, 3 Chickens, he continually beats his girlfriend. Definitely not a PC story. Here are some direct quotes from the story:          once she was screaming these insanities from the fold-down bed in our apartment. I begged her to stop, but she wouldn’t. finally, I just walked over, lifted up the bed with her in it and folded everything into the wall.          then I went over and sat down and listened to her scream.          but she kept screaming so I walked over and pulled the bed out of the wall again there she lay, holding her arm, claiming it was broken.and          now, another time she angered me and I slapped her but it was across the mouth and it broke her false teeth.          I was surprised that it broke her false teeth and I went out and got this super cement glue and I glued her teeth together for her. it worked for awhile and then one night as she sat there drinking her wine she suddenly had a mouthful of broken teeth.          the wine was so strong it undid the glue. it was disgusting. we had to get her some new teeth, how we did it, I don’t quite remember, but she claimed they made her look like a horse.and          the bar was full, every seat taken. I lifted my hand. I swung. I backhanded her off that god damned stool. she fell to the floor and screamed.          There are more abusive incidents in the story. This is horrible stuff to anyone--and I imagine that’s most of us--who is interested in consciousness-raising about spouse abuse and battering--but there is a value to being exposed to this kind of material. How else can we understand anything about violence unless we observe and portray it accurately? It exists, just as surely as serial killers exist, and how can one combat evil unless one understands its nature?          Gordon Weaver, who was on the faculty here at Vermont until a few years ago, told me in an interview, that, “If our special interest, as writers and/or editors, is the precise use of language toward the end of a viable perception of and effect on reality, we may argue there is some virtue implicit in any utterance (written or oral) that confronts the consensus of any gathering.” He gives an example. “There is a cost that will be paid by all concerned if one tells a Polack joke in the presence of Poles, but I contend the cost is greater if one stifles or sanitizes the anecdote.” Gordon has something here, I think. Weaver also told me that academicians are perhaps the newest bullies on the censorship block and perhaps the most dangerous of all. He stated that, “There is a greater danger, it seems to me, when the censors come from the ranks of the presumably ‘enlightened’. It is not surprising that a number of college and university communities nurture factions who wish to control free speech; it is unsettling when more sophisticated citizens (faculty) add their clout to movements desiring to police our utterance in the interests of what minority or another deems politically incorrect.”          Whether or not you agree with writers like Bukowski, or Weaver for that matter, is unimportant. What is important is that they and others of diverse opinions have a forum to be heard and read. That forum is disintegrating under the onslaught of those who wish to stifle speech that disagrees with theirs. Truth is in danger of being extinguished, and it may fall to us who write to be the last vanguard of free speech. That is why writers such as Bukowski need to be published and need to be read by establishment presses and before they’re dead. There are some of us who feel we are plunging back into a Dark Age. History would confirm that to be so. After nearly every period of enlightenment, anarchy prevails again for awhile, and this is what I see us heading toward, as a nation and as a world.          It is the nature of groups to want to stifle opposing viewpoints. In this country, supposedly the land of free speech, attempts at suppression have been with us since the adoption of the First Amendment, but the preponderance of that type of activity has been traditionally borne by extremists of the far right and far left political and societal spectrum. Those with the hot fire of righteousness in their bellies have been the usual standard-bearers for the termination of ideas contrary to their agenda and such should probably be expected.          Gordon Weaver told me that although he dislikes boorish and bigoted expressions, he sees a greater danger in disallowing their spokesmen an opportunity to be heard.          “The censors will always be with us,” he said. “It is the nature of both institutions and individuals to desire the silence of those they wish to suppress. Institutions with political power or ambitions for same (government, churches, schools) can probably be fended off--as they have been in modern times at least--by organized responses. The American Civil Liberties Union has a pretty good record in this regard. Simple crackpots (racists, militant feminists, and other self-appointed arbiters of community morality) seem to wither away if studiously ignored.”          Repression comes in many forms, not always overt. Kathleen M. Sullivan, a professor of law at Harvard Law School, in talking about the censorship issue as it affects funding for the NEA, says of the PC issue, “An artist who receives a check in the mail (from the NEA) with a ‘hit list’ of forbidden ideas attached will forego too much valuable and innovative expression for fear it will come too close to the line. As (US Supreme Court) Justice Thurgood Marshall once put it, the problem with a ‘sword of Damocles is that it hangs--not that it drops.’”          Fred Grandy, former actor on the Love Boat and now a Congressman from Iowa, says, “I am no artist and have 10 years on TV to prove it. But I have spent enough of my life around creative minds to know that you cannot have art without risk. You cannot write language proscribing the human imagination that will not turn artists away in droves.”          Speaking of Congress in terms that could be applied to college professors and publishers as well, Grandy said, “Trying to eliminate smut by allowing Congress to tell America what is and is not artistic is as misguided as attempting to legislate patriotism by amending the Constitution to prohibit flag burning.”          And publishers. How do they, as deciders of what news is fit to print, view the censorship debate? Reactions range from the moderately perplexed to the horrified doomsayers.          Robert McDowell, who publishes the Story Line Press, wrote an opinion piece for the Register-Guard in Eugene, Oregon, which perhaps synopsizes the publisher’s view. “The debate pits a democratic majority believing in our First Amendment rights of free speech against a well-financed and well-organized minority extolling the virtues of all that is wholesome and the government’s right to control the subject matter of the books we read, the music we enjoy, the paintings and plays we experience.” McDowell calls Senator Jesse Helms and other individuals and groups’ efforts to censor materials funded by the NEA, “the most severe legalized censorship in this country since the McCarthy era,” and labels such censorship efforts as being “shameful attacks on free speech and the artist’s right to represent the truth as he or she perceives it.”          Pulitzer-Prize-winning novelist, Larry McMurtry, in a Washington Post article, accused the Jesse Helms-led forces of attempting to “eliminate all sex from American art if they can. Rembrandt’s sketch of a fully clothed heterosexual couple attempting the missionary position behind a bush would likely not be thought fund-worthy by Helms, whose stated preferences would limit us to snow scenes, pictures of bird dogs or romantic landscapes involving, if possible, humble tobacco farms.” McMurtry goes on, “The narrative as these individuals see it, in their determination to tell Americans what they need and don’t need in the way of publicly funded art, is rigidly chaste: no public money for anything with sex in it! (They may claim that (they) only want to withhold public money from art that depicts or describes ‘wrong’ sex-- i.e., homeoerotic (no grants to Leonardo or Proust!) sadomasochistic (no Westerns, no film noir), exploitive of children (no Lolita, no Lewis Carroll), but it’s clear that they really mean to eliminate all sex from American art if they can.”          Kathleen Sullivan puts it even more succinctly, when she says, “A free society can have no official orthodoxy in art any more than in religion or politics. And in a free society, such orthodoxy can no more be purchased by power of the purse than compelled by power of the sword.”          Just a couple of years ago, Stanley Banks, Kansas   City playwright and poet, offered the balance of such cost: “We will begin to see dull art which has no freshness of vision. Certain points of view will be silenced. When that happens our society will be seriously threatened without a bomb being blasted.” He warns us not to “call for laws to censor artists who challenge our consciousness in ways that might be uncomfortable, irritating, risqué, etc. For those who don’t want to see or hear or read about acts or points of view contrary to their own, he advises, “simply don’t look, buy it or let the kids have access to it!”          Banks’ “dull art which has no freshness of vision” is already upon us. It has always been with us, since censorship in one form or another has always been around--it has only increased mightily in the past few years. The result is art which is becoming blander and blander, much resembling the “art” that was allowed to surface in totalitarian governments such as the USSR of a few years past and in many other governments. America is not yet at that stage, but if current developments continue in publishing, in the university, and in government, we are not far from achieving total censorship, imposed by the group in control.          What scares me the most is that universities should be the bastion of free thought but the state of the matter is that free debate of ideas is rapidly disappearing from the college campus. As more and more writers come out of university settings and are being influenced by teachers with a decided political bent, the writing they produce becomes more and more insipid. These same writers take over the litmags and editor positions at publishing houses and impose their political beliefs on those who submit, publishing only those that can pass the PC test in the content of their creative material. As Kurt Vonnegut said in a quote cited earlier, “Literature should not disappear up its own asshole, so to speak.” Well, it’s in great danger of doing just that. It’s about halfway up the anus.          In interviewing folks for an article I wrote on censorship for Circle K Magazine, I was referred to the brother-in-law of a friend of mine, an Australian, who was teaching physics and doing research at one of America’s leading universities which I cannot name because I’ve promised him anonymity. This man says, “I think it’s a myth that censorship doesn’t exist on college campuses. I believe universities should be places where anybody can say whatever they want and everybody should be very tolerant, but it’s just not true. Students are punished for saying certain things. You could say whatever you wanted at the University  of Sydney (where he’s from). They were much more tolerant there. In student publications there was much less concern about libel, for example. The litigation aspect puts a lot of pressure on what ideas you can express.” This man only agreed to give me his views when I swore several times I wouldn’t use his name or even tell what university he was at, for fear of losing his job. It’s a sad day when a person from another country is allowed a greater freedom of expression there than in his adopted country which professes to be the freest nation on earth.          This professor went on to say, “I think there’s more of a tradition in European-style universities for freedom of speech--that that’s what universities are for. In America, the impression I get is that universities are for other purposes...for training professionals and for football games. It’s not about intellectual freedom. You pay us (educators) your money and you want something at the end. You want a guaranteed elite job in society, and it has nothing to do with expanding your mind. You’re buying a product. It’s more of a consumer orientation.”          He adds, “The government is trying to censor more and more science that they are actually paying for. For example, on sensitive subjects as global warming, the government wants to see research results first, because of the possible political consequences.”          Americans should be ashamed when they have prided themselves on theirs being the leading example of a free society, when others in the world community may be seeing us very differently, as evidenced by my anonymous critic and source.          Anita Manning, writing for USA Today, says that the issue is different in colleges than it is in the lower levels of education.          “In K through 12, there is a school board or some sort of governing body that chooses what books are included in the curriculum...whereas in the college setting, the individual professor or instructor chooses the books for that course and students choose whether or not to take the course, leading to entire different issues.”          In June, 1992, Brenda Suderman, acting media relations officer for The Bulletin, the student newspaper at the University  of Manitoba in Winnipeg, reported that the university deleted about 170 files containing material on sexual bondage and pornography from the Internet computer system the university subscribes to. Gerry Miller, Director of Computer Services, made the decision in consultation with Terry Falconer, Vice-President (administration), saying the material was removed because “we felt they (the deleted files) didn’t support the mission of the university and we felt they were objectionable.”          Alisa Smith, co-editor of The Marlet, the student newspaper at the University of Victoria in British Columbia, published what university officials deemed objectionable material as exampled by a lesbian, gay, bisexual issue put out in 1991 which featured male and female genitalia on the cover. About 2,000 copies were thrown into dumpsters by campus traffic and security functionaries upon administrative order. Even so, Smith feels the press is becoming a bit freer. (Yeah, well--go figure…)          She says, “The mainstream media is covering a lot of issues that only the alternative press used to cover. I suppose the backlash against political correctness is sort of an attempted censorship, like trying to silence people, but not by directly shutting down their newspapers. (Universities) are trying to shut down thought, rather than newspapers. All the articles that you see are about how PC’s have sort of gotten a grip on society and how people can’t say what they want anymore. I guess it’s like a left-wing phenomenon.”          Let money talk, though, and censorship takes on yet another clever form: the economic kind.          “Personally,” says Smith, “I think the biggest form of censorship right now is the fact that the economy is so bad, making advertising really hard to come by. A lot of papers used to have a fairly idealistic boycott list for advertising that they wouldn’t use because of things those advertisers were funding--like nuclear systems contracting or because they were pro-apartheid in South Africa. Editors are finding they can’t make ideological choices any more because of monetary pressure. If you’re really dependent on advertising dollars, you have to basically write the kinds of things that won’t offend your advertisers and don’t disagree with their stances.”          This latter statement seems to contrast with her earlier one that “the press is becoming a bit freer,” and is perhaps a good example of why censorship is unnecessary. If you allow anyone to talk freely long enough, they may provide sufficient evidence by their own words that they should not be taken that seriously when giving us the benefit of their opinion.          Fearful of bad publicity during stressful economic times, it is not so surprising college and university administrations are increasingly acting to suppress anything that might bring adverse publicity to their campuses. What is surprising is that faculty members are increasingly joining in, even in the supercharged Politically Correct environment that has permeated most higher-education campuses in one way or another.          A 1992 incident at Nicholls  State University in Thibodaux, Louisiana, exemplifies the debate and poses difficult and perplexing arguments for both sides of the issue.          A cartoon ran in the student newspaper, the Nicholls Worth, poking fun at three black singers in a rap group that had performed on campus. Black students who were offended, protested by burning about 150 copies of the paper publicly. Their complaint was that they were greatly upset by the exaggerated features of the cartoon figures and the stereotypes it reinforced. Eric Knott, president of a black fraternity denied that the protest had anything to do with being politically correct.          “I’m not one to hide behind racism and claim that everything in society is racist, (but) the cartoon clearly degraded the black race,” Knott says.          Marty Authement, student editor of the paper, said that he “used poor judgment” in allowing the cartoon to be published, but was also concerned that “political correctness is limiting what journalists can do. These days you have to be more sensitive than you usually would be. If you live by the strict law of political correctness, there’s not much left.”          I had a very jarring and dismaying experience with PCism with my own novel THE DEATH OF TARPONS. A few years before it actually got published, a regional publisher in the Southwest wanted to buy it. A very few months before this offer, I was sleeping on a garage floor in California and eating out of a Bob’s Big Boy dumpster, so the money he offered had the same value as a million dollars to me. I almost signed the contract until the publisher said, “Well, we have to change a lot of this. There’s stuff in here that might make certain folks upset.” He gave as an example a scene in which the boy’s father whips him with a live king snake. This might offend the snake lovers, he said. That’s got to be what?--seven or eight in the U.S.A.? Not counting, of course, the folks who use them in church services. He cited about twenty other scenes I’d have to change because they might offend this person or that. Reluctantly, I withdrew the book, not knowing if it would ever be published, and indeed, it was another five years before I found a publisher who wasn’t as concerned about snake lovers’ feelings and was more concerned with putting out a book that she felt had literary value.          Mind you, this was several years before the wholesale PC attitude took over the country. This asshole--and I don’t excuse myself from the term--was merely the forerunner of what is a terrifying fact of life today.          If you believe this to be the ravings of a paranoid mind, consider these facts:          A record 348 incidents of attempted censorship occurred in the 1991-92 school year, according to The American Way, a liberal watchdog group. That’s an increase of 20% over the previous high, a figure they claim poses an alarming advance in assaults on a basic Constitutional right--a right almost universally assured in most of the free world.          The Literary Network, a project jointly administered by Poets&Writers, Inc. and the Council of Literary Magazines and Presses report over 6,000 attempts to remove books from shelves in American libraries in the 1980’s and ‘the number of incidents is noticeably on the rise.”          Concerned Women for America, a conservative, pro-family group asserts all censorship attempts are not necessarily bad. Caia Mockaitis, speaking for the organization, says the issue is one of selection, not censorship, many times, in that “there are some materials that are appropriate for kids and some that are not,” no matter what adults’ political bias, liberal or conservative.          Mockaitis has plenty of like-minded supporters. Censorship attempts at banning outright or restricting access to books and magazines in secondary school libraries were successful in nearly one-half of instances between 1987 and 1990, reports a University of Wisconsin survey of 6,600 schools. Challenged publications were removed 26 percent of the time, restricted by age or grade level 22 percent of the time, and more likely to occur at small schools.          The book challenged most? Judy Blume’s Forever, a story of a teenage girl who loses her virginity. Sports Illustrated’s swimsuit issue and Rolling Stone were the most-challenged magazines at secondary schools, according to USA Today, Jan. 20, 1992.          Consider this item: “Pornography Victims Compensation Act” was a bill on the U.S. Senate floor that would enable victims of sex crimes to file civil suits in an effort to recover damages from producers and distributors of obscene materials (including publishers, wholesalers, and booksellers) if the victims can show that the materials “caused” the crimes. This “third-party liability” bill is a way of imposing censorship through a back door. This item was reported by the American Booksellers Association.          Here’s another: In May, 1990, Ferris Alexander, operator of a chain of bookstores, theaters and video stores in the Minneapolis area, was found guilty of violating the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organization Act (RICO) obscenity forfeiture law. His crime? Selling four magazines and three videotapes found to be obscene and valued at less than $200. Alexander was sentenced to six years in prison, fined $200,000 and forfeited a $25 million dollar business. This was reported by The Media Coalition.          Here’s another. Three editors of the Ohio  State University student newspaper, The Lantern, resign when members of the journalism faculty issue a policy statement that the faculty advisor had the authority to review articles for libel before they were published. This story from The Chronicle of Higher Education, March  4, 1992.          Censorship is everywhere and rising in attempts and more frightening, in successful attempts.          Free speech advocate Nat Hentoff, the author of Free Speech for Me - But Not for Thee: How the American Left and Right Relentlessly Censor Each Other from HarperCollins, feels that in too many cases, publishers, school boards and principals remove or change material for students rather than face the wrath of militant parent groups. Seeing authorities suppress ideas in some cases, and being in a school in which books keep disappearing, gives a graphic lesson to students, Hentoff feels, in that they may have doubts that theirs is a country of intellectual freedom.          And it appears it is special-interest groups that are behind these efforts and that the majority of Americans are against censorship. A survey conducted by Louis Harris for the American Council for the Arts and sponsored by Phillip Morris Companies, Inc., in February, 1992, polled 1,500 adults over the age of 18 by telephone. Part of the findings were that 91% felt it important for school children to be exposed to and participate in the arts; 67% felt learning about the arts as important as learning about history and geography, 60% say as important as math and science, and 53% believe the arts are important as learning to read and write. It’s evident that it’s a small but vocal and politically-powerful group of minorities who are succeeding in censorship activities and these groups emerge from both ends of the political and societal spectrum.          Virtually every publisher in the country, from the smallest litmag to the largest publishing conglomerate, is terrified of antagonizing any reader whatsoever, unless the person offended is not part of a highly-organized, highly-vocal political group. This includes both right and left-wingers. It seems everybody in America has now organized, has a group with a slogan, a newsletter, a home page on the Internet, and a secret handshake. The battle is being waged over who gets ultimate control of the presses. And it doesn’t matter who wins. We all lose. What we lose is freedom of expression. And once that happens, we are done as a free society. I go to Gordon Weaver once again, who said it as best as it can be said. “Censorship from without is bad for the language, bad for those who speak or write it; self-imposed censorship, whatever the motive is worse. If you won’t say what you think, you run the risk of losing the powers of both speech and thought. I suspect we’ll be safe just as long as we refuse to accept censorship for anyone.”          Again, I quote Gordon Weaver for perhaps the best take on the situation. “If the king is naked, we’re all (including the king) better served if someone says so.”          Well, the king is indeed, naked. The only problem is not enough of us are saying so, preferring to remain safe, keep our jobs, get our material published and so we go on, giving silent tacit agreement to what is happening. This is an understandable position for many in our society; it is unforgivable for writers, at least in my opinion. Writers should be like the canaries in coal mines, the warning system that things are not right and that danger looms. As a group, we have many of us become complacent, intent only on saving our professional selves at the expense of freedom of thought. Maybe we understand too well that although the canary in the coal mine provided a valuable service, in doing so he ended up room temperature.          I cannot count the numbers of instances acquaintances of mine have said to me, “I cannot say certain things I believe in, to my class, my teachers, my peers, or in my writing, because I would lose my job or be censured or not see my work in print, etc. What’s wrong with us? What kinds of writers are we producing in this country that are fearful to take stands on issues they believe fervently about simply because they risk disapproval? What kind of chickenshit writer is it that the little squiggles he or she puts down on paper consist of half-truths and integrity that is compromised regularly? We are surrendering something precious more by what we don’t do than what we do. Are we so enamored of safety and comfort that we are willing to give up the freedom to express ourselves honestly? It seems that we are. It is a growing malaise that is sweeping the country and I hold that the only ones that can stem the tide are the writers in our society. But where are they?          Some are out there. There are a few. William Vollmann. Brian Everson. Michael Tolkin. Bukowski. There are others that we’ll never know of because they can’t find a forum. There need to be a lot more such voices. What is really needed is for establishment forums to begin looking more at the quality of the writing than the content. To give an ear to voices that refuse to be influenced by a job, a smile from an empty-headed bureaucrat, publication in a white-bread magazine or by a bottom-line mentality of a publishing conglomerate.          I think back to when I began writing as a grade school kid. One of the things I used to do was write humorous sketches of some of the more terrifying individuals I faced daily. Individuals like the bullies I and others faced, from the schoolyard rowdy to the teacher who thought her job was to intimidate her class into submission. I’d show these “pieces” to friends, they’d be passed around, and in some cases, public opinion ended those offenders’ bullying careers. Nobody likes to push someone around if he’s going to get laughed at by everyone else. It just plain takes all the power out of it, not to mention the fun.          The problem today is, the bullies have taken over not only the schoolyard, but the university, the Congress, and the publishing house. Many of us in this room became writers because of a bully somewhere in their past. Maybe it was another kid, or a group of kids, or maybe it was a parent or a teacher. We found we could effectively combat these kinds of folks by the written word. If we were physically weaker we possessed a strength that was virtually indefensible against. The power of ideas, expressed upon the page and in open debate. Do we want to give up our only weapon against tyranny? I hope not.          And by the way--those writers I mentioned at the beginning of this lecture--Whitman, Steinbeck, Faulkner, Thackery, Milton, Shakespeare, Melville, Alcott--and that I described as “safe”, were anything but that when they were being published. They were almost all rogues in their time and were, by turns, either censored, vilified, viewed with shock, attacked by those in power, or even unpublished in their lifetimes because of the content of their writing. It is only after many years had passed and the political climate had shifted, that the original perceptions of them and their work were considered nonthreatening enough to exist in our libraries and schools. Although many of them are still censored, even today. Steinbeck routinely makes his appearance at book-burnings and other censorship attempts, along with Faulkner, Whitman and even Shakespeare. They were “safe” to me when I read them, simply because I was reading them in a different, more removed era, but in fact, those writers who have become what we call “immortal” have largely been the risk-takers of their time, who wrote in line with their conscience, rather than the political and social mores of their period. Many of them endured great distress because what they were writing was politically incorrect at the time. The thing was, there were then and still are now, publishers who gave them a forum, often at great risk, and there were those who read them, and so the world has been enriched through those individuals’ courage. Knowing this, it would be easy to say, “well, hey, those folks got published and there are those today being published who don’t parrot the party line, so what’s the problem? The problem is, once we as writers and future editors and educators begin to think like that, complacency sets in and we get the attitude to “let someone else worry about it” and that’s when our freedom of expression becomes seriously eroded and in danger of disappearing. Freedom of expression is a value that must be continuously fought for, over and over. That war is never finished unless one side or the other lays down its arms. As part of this generation of writers, it is our duty to take up the battle.          There is another point of view that says that it’s not the job of an artist to express a viewpoint or an opinion at all. While I respect the right of those who feel that way, I disagree. Indeed, is it possible to find a writer of note who hasn’t expressed his point-of-view, politically, through his or her writings? What else was Steinbeck commenting on in “The Grapes of Wrath” if not a political system? Perhaps he didn’t stand on a stump and proclaim to the world his political views but they sure are right there in his fiction. There are countless others I could give as examples and I’m sure you have your own list. Some artists feel it is their job to present a vision of the world, not a political opinion. I don’t see a difference. It seems to be a matter of semantics. What is a “vision of the world” except a political opinion? Or you might call such a view a “philosophy” but again, philosophies (in my opinion) are nothing but political ideologies dressed up in a tuxedo. I believe it all comes down to politics and I mean politics in the purest sense, as in I want mine and you want yours and I’d kill you for yours if we hadn’t agreed that we’re civilized and have figured out a way for both of us to keep our stuff and not worry about the other taking it. And, for me, that’s what censorship finally boils down to. It’s refuting the principle that I can have mine and you can’t take it and you can have yours and I can’t have it either. You can just substitute the word “opinion” for a particular possession. What I object to is the closing down of forums for all but those who agree with the body politic, not in an overt way but by more subtle and insidious means.          Thank you for your time. I hope I’ve given you some food for thought. I hope you’ll read some Charles Bukowski, some William Vollmann. I don’t even care if you don’t like or agree with them. In fact, the only way this little talk will be a success if people go out of here arguing with each other. Personally, I’m like Robert Duvall in The Apocalypse Now - I love the smell of a good argument in the morning. I’d like to leave you with one of my favorite quotes. In the preface to the infamous Story of O, Jean Paulhan wrote, “Dangerous books are those that restore us to our natural state of danger.”"},

Tentatively titled 'circle kerkin' on cardiff hill'. primarily family of eight is the mcgregor's. they live in a neo-classical, rather large colonial manse atop the hill which is named after the mother's family. teh family is all boys save the main character's twin sister. they have a black housekeeper who has a bastard son. she was raped and he is the result. He looks like and acts much like the classical actor sidney poiter. the suburb is all white except for these two black americans. he goes to school across town at an all blackschool yet is best friends with the main character, max mcgregor. max and his best friend (buddy freeman) are inseparable. max is about 5'5\", reddish blonde, fair compexion and a smattering of freckles. they are stock car racing junkies and have a car. they are the local favorites and end up making it to daytona in 1976. buddy wins the race, however, is killed during his victory lap...how, that's part of the story. the story involves racial biogtry, sexual diversity, NASCAR, murder and a few other things. that's a snapshot of the story, Les. Sorry I rambled, just didn't know exactly what I wanted to say but figure you'd get the general idea.KennKenn, based on this, I see a common flaw. You’ve got a bunch of characters, nice settings, and some seemingly interesting situations, but I don’t see the story you have in mind here. In fact, it looks suspiciously like an episodic story—this happens, then this happens, then this… etc. Unfortunately, there’s no market for episodic stories. No “Kane wandering the earth, having adventures and ending up in the lotus position having resolved world peace…”Here’s what I’d suggest. First, to get in the proper frame of mind, I’d not call your protagonist “the main character.” Call him the protagonist. When people use terms like “MC” automatically, I suspect they’re thinking in episodic terms. A mindset that says: Get a cool character, set him in motion, let him have adventures, setbacks, etc. Alas, that’s not a story, at least not one in publishable terms. That’s something that gets “Cool” uttered by one’s writing group when described, but tossed unceremoniously by agents and editors.Second, stories that make it to print are always about an individual with a compelling story problem that the reader can relate to and deem important enough to follow the protagonist through his/her struggle to resolve it.. The story begins when that problem is introduced, i.e., the inciting incident. The rest of the novel is about the protagonist’s struggle to resolve that problem against increasing odds and obstacles. The story problem has to color every single page of the novel. If there are subplots, they have to be derived from the main plot and only be there to contribute to it and are subservient to the main plot, i.e., the protagonist’s struggle to resolve his problem.Third, there needs to be an antagonist, an individual whose goals conflict with the goals of the protagonist. Neither of these people—protagonist or antagonist—are created in a moral sense. Neither should be looked at as “good” or “evil” or whatever. The protagonist is simply the character through whose persona we (readers) experience the story. The antagonist is simply the person whose own goals are in direct conflict with the goal of the protagonist. In the movie, Thelma & Louise, for example, Thelma is the protagonist. She’s the one we follow throughout to see if she resolves her problem. (Initial, surface problem—to escape her husband’s petty dominance. Eventual, story-worthy problem—to escape male dominance over women in society.) The antagonist is Hal, the Arkansas state cop. He’s not a bad guy at all—in fact, he’s probably the best guy in the story. His goal is to catch Thelma (and Louise) but not for a bad reason. He wants to save them from first being arrested and then from death. Very good guy. His goal therefore is in direct opposition to Thelma’s goal of escaping male dominance (surface manifestation of that—to escape being captured and going to jail).What I’d need to make sense of your story (and to see if you actually have a story) is for you to tell me who your protagonist is and what his story problem is and who his antagonist is. That it’s in Kansas and that there are racial tensions and all of that is okay, but that isn’t the story and not what’s important in creating a story. For story purposes, it doesn’t matter if it’s set in Kansas or on the moon or if it was yesterday, a hundred years ago, or twenty years in the future. That isn’t the important stuff in a novel’s planning. All that’s important is the protagonist and his/her story problem. That’s the cake; the rest is the icing.Also, please do yourself a favor and don’t think of characters as “heroes” and “villains.” That may doom your book before it begins! Same with “main character.” Those kinds of terms only lead to creating plots that aren’t sound and characters that don’t work. In the case of heroes and villains, authors who think that way often end up with Dudley Doright and Snidely Whiplash. Cartoon, one-dimensional, cardboard characters. Make sense? Others may disagree, but that’s my opinion for what it’s worth…What I always do is to send a prospective a client a handout on outlining and ask them to create an outline. Don’t panic—it’s not an outline ala those Comp I things with Roman numerals, etc. It’s a practical document, consisting of five statements and containing 15-20 words. It not only allows the writer to focus on the story, it provides a very practical road map in writing it.BTW, did you mean “circle jerking” instead of “circle kerking?” Circle jerking is an old, well-known term, but I’ve never heard of “circle-kerking.” (Kenn wrote back that he did, indeed, intend “circle-jerking” and it was a typo. I think that makes him the pivot man in the circle jerk--the guy in the barrel… Kidding, Kenn!)If this works for you and you’d like to look at possibly working with me, let me know and I’ll be happy to send you the outlining handout.Also, take a look at my blog at the post on “The Smell of the Rain on the Road at Dawn” to make sure this isn’t what you’re visualizing at this point. If it is, you’ll just need to crystallize your idea so that it becomes a story and not just a vision.Hope this helps, Kenn!Blue skies,LesThis was our initial exchange, and I’m happy to report that Kenn is sending me his material and we’re off to the races! He also said it was fine to use his name and to also use his professional signature (Kenn’s a professional speaker and comic), which is: kennyGene: a Wannabe comic.The reason I’m posting this is that I suspect other writers are seeing their potential novels in the same ways and I thought this might help in getting their novels back on the right track and save themselves a lot of time and wasted effort.Blue skies,Les"},
{"title": "A FICTION WRITER'S WORKSHOP AT THE BIJOU... and a favor to ask...", "date": "Thursday, October 14, 2010", "text": "Hi folks,I’ve got a major favor to ask of the writers here. My agent, Chip MacGregor, is preparing to send out my proposal for a new writer’s text, titled A Fiction Writer’s Workshop at the Bijou which will use movies instead of the usual literary examples/models to inform writing techniques. We thought it would help convince publishers of the value of this proposed book if I was able to provide endorsements from writers—both published and unpublished—and students of writing, as to their opinion of the value of such a book.Although several other movies will be included, the primary film used as the model will be Thelma and Louise. We're investigating the possibility of including a dvd of this movie along with the book. It doesn’t matter what stage of your writing career you’re in. Beginners, seasoned pros, published authors and those still seeking your first book contract—all of your opinions will count.I’m providing the first chapter of this book and the list of the other chapters here so you can get an idea of the scope and style of the book.For those of you who are willing to help me out, all I need is a brief 1-3 paragraphs giving your opinion of the proposed book and how you think it might help your own writing. If you’ve read either of my previous two writer’s books, Finding Your Voice and Hooked, you might say something to the effect of how either of those books have helped you on your own writer’s journey. Please include your name and a brief description of your status in the writing community—author, student, etc. If you’re an author, please list your books. Some of these will probably be selected by the publisher as blurbs, with your permission, of course. If you want to write something longer, that’s great, but just a couple of short paragraphs are fine and very much appreciated.Please send anything you’re willing to furnish me to my email at butchedgerton@comcast.net. If you have any questions, just send me your questions at the same address.Thank you! We’re fairly confident this book will get taken and if it does, a big part of the reason will be the help you’re giving me here. And, please don’t think you have to be a big “name” in the biz—it’s just as valuable for a publisher to know that beginning writers see the value in such a book—after all, that’s the intended market.Here’s the rough draft of Chapter One, followed by a list of the rest of the chapters:CHAPTER ONEDefining characters and their arcsby their physical actions            I think you’ll find this chapter alone worth the price of admission to our little “theater” between the covers. The writer who can master the art and craft of defining their characters by their actions is going to be the author whose work gets read. By lots and lots of folks… Enough, hopefully, that you’ll never again have to say to someone about the novel you’ve written that it’s “only available in my room.”*                                                          *                                                          *A common fault of fiction writers in defining their characters and their character arcs is by neglecting to use one of the most powerful methods available. The technique? Namely, by showing the reader the nature of their character by the physical actions the writer chooses to provide their characters with. Precisely what countless writing gurus have been talking since those cave drawing days when they urged their students to: “Show, don’t tell.”Movie people do this better than almost anyone. We can learn a lot from these Hollywood folks!            Most of us as fiction writers flesh out our characters with the use of description, via dialogue, by the interior thoughts of characters and by similar methods. All of these are good techniques and work well in the short story and novel. However, if the author ignores the use of using physical actions to help create their characters and to also show how they’ve evolved due to the events that happen along the way in the story (that character arc us writing teachers are always talking about), they’re missing what can be the most powerful tool of all. This is an area we can really make our novels come alive and impact the reader on a much deeper level.The use of description is perhaps the weakest of the novelist’s tools in terms of creating an image of the character in the readers’ minds. What of the following makes more of an impact in the reader’s mind? To read: “Elizabeth was an arthritic old woman.” Or, to read: Elizabeth labored up the stairs, a painful step at a time. She paused at each step, grasped the handrail with both hands and forced her ancient legs up yet another step. The second example wins, hands-down. Why? Because we “see” an action the character takes and because we see it happening it has an emotional impact on us. In the first example, we’re “told” what the character is (arthritic). Doesn’t make much of an impression at all. Not even close to the impression we get when we see her forcing those gnarled knees up the stairs.This is important enough that I’ll say it again: Characters are defined best and on a deeper level by their actions. As are their character arcs. You know, that deal where the character emerges at the end of the story a different person than when the story began as a result of all they’d gone through during the course of the tale. Why? Because they experience what the character does and what the character experiences at the same time the character does. They’re not being “told” this character has undergone a sea change and asked to take it on faith—they “see” it with their own eyes, and are therefore convinced to a degree not remotely possible with the author “telling” them there’s been a change via their thoughts or any of the other aforementioned techniques. Their actions affect readers emotionally, while descriptions only affect readers intellectually. Emotion always trumps intellect in story.            A movie that illustrates brilliantly how all this can be accomplished through the character’s actions is screenwriter Callie Khouri’s Thelma and Louise. We’ll be looking closely at this film in this chapter and others, as it’s one of those rare movies that provide many, many teaching moments that can be valuable to fiction writers.            The basic plot of Thelma and Louise, is that two friends plan to go on a weekend getaway fishing in the mountains. On the way there, they stop at a roadhouse for a quick drink or two and Thelma gets sexually attacked by Harlan in the parking lot. Louise saves her friend by putting a gun to Harlan’s head just as he’s trying to penetrate Thelma. Situation defused, Harlan just has to say one last insult and Louise shoots and kills him. The women flee the scene and the rest of the movie is basically a chase scene, ending with the women opting for suicide rather than to go prison.            The plot is fairly simple on the surface, but the characterizations Khouri has created of these people make this an extremely complex film. What is magnificent about their characterizations is that they are each revealed chiefly through their actions. Virtually every single line in the script and every moment on the screen can be studied to your gain. I’ve watched this movie more than three hundred times and each time learned something new, both from the script Khouri has created and from the brilliant work these talented actors and the director Ridley Scott bring to the project.First, let’s look at the physical actions Khouri has given to character Thelma (as played by Geena Davis) which define her character and brilliantly carry the viewer through as she transforms into a “new” person at the end. Louise is also given actions to define her character and arc, but we’ll mostly be looking at Thelma’s. Once you’ve read this, then the script, and then watched the movie, take an extra step and go back and see how Louise’s actions inform her character as well.*                                                          *                                                          *The setup*                                                          *                                                          *            We’ll begin with the “setup.” The structure of movies used to be that roughly the first ten minutes served as the “setup.” This is where the principle characters are introduced and we learn who they are and what their situation is and the inciting incident and story problem are dramatized. While this is still followed, the setup time is undergoing a major change in that it no longer takes ten minutes.            In the beginning of the setup of Thelma and Louise, there are a series of intercuts between the dual protagonists. We see Louise (played by Susan Sarandon) at her work—slinging hash in a Denny’s-type restaurant. We see Thelma at home with her emotionally-abusive and immature husband Darryl (played by Stephen Tobolowsky), a guy who’s transcended the role of male chauvinist pig to that of male chauvinist hog.            What actions does she perform that define her character? The very first one is her dialogue with Louise. The movie opens with Louise at a pay phone at the restaurant calling Thelma, asking her if she’s ready to leave on her trip. Here’s the way it looks in the script:*                                                          *                                                          *Louise(at pay phone)I hope you’re packed, little housewife, ‘cause we are outtahere tonight.(By the way, in this snatch of dialog is virtually the only thing director Scott changed from what Khouri had written. In Khouri’s original version, Louise calls her “little sister” and Scott felt this would mislead the viewer into thinking they were sisters, so he changed it to “little housewife.” In my opinion, one of the reasons Scott is such a great director is that he doesn’t let his ego interfere by rewriting a script when the script is great, and in this case, I think he got it wrong and should have used the original version. He shows here he didn’t “trust the viewer’s intelligence to get it” unless he kind of dumbed it down. As it’s the only change he made in the entire script, I’ll give him a pass. Many directors would have changed lots more!)            As to how this works, when Louise calls her “little housewife,” this defines their relationship. As you’ll see, Louise begins in an almost “mother” role and Thelma as the child and in the very first line of dialogue in the movie, Khouri has already begun to define that relationship.)*                                                          *                                                          *            Thelma responds with her first dialogue, which likewise immediately begins to define her character.*                                                          *                                                          *INT. THELMA’S KITCHEN—MORNING Thelma(whispering guiltily)                        Well, wait now. I still have to ask Darryl if I can go.*                                                          *                                                          *            Right off the bat, we can tell from what she says to Louise that she’s one of those “dutiful little wives.” We don’t know at this point if Darryl is her boyfriend or husband, but we do know from what she says that she feels she has to get permission from him, and that speaks volumes about their relationship, whichever it is.            But, as Louise answers her offscreen on the phone, and we hear Louise’s voice, Khouri gives Thelma a great piece of “actor’s business” (action) that really shows her character and where she’s at in her relationship with Darryl. Here’s Khouri’s action for her character (italics mine):*                                                          *                                                          *Thelma has the phone tucked under her chin as she cuts out coupons from the newspaper and pins them on a bulletin board already covered with them. We see various recipes torn out from women’s magazines along the lines of “101 Ways to Cook Pork.”*                                                          *                                                          *            If that action doesn’t show us who Thelma is and what kind of person she is, nothing ever will! In less than fifteen seconds on the screen, Khouri has given us both a bit of dialogue and a specific action that deliver us a three-dimensional character and shows us exactly who she is.            Then, after she hangs up from her conversation with Louise, Thelma goes to the bottom of the stairs, leans on the banister, and yells up, “Darryl! Honey, you’d better hurry up!”            Again, with dialogue, she’s shown she’s the dutiful little wife, pandering to her husband almost as if he was a little child and she the mom urging him to get up. You can just tell that this is a daily routine and that she has to be the “mom” to her husband… and we get all this before we even see Darryl. By her dialogue and by her actions. All in about thirty seconds.            Darryl makes his appearance and Khouri defines his character also by his actions. First, by the way he’s dressed and the way he acts. Khouri gives him this appearance: Darryl comes trotting down the stairs. Polyester was made for this man and he’s dripping in “men’s” jewelry.            She further defines his character by his response to Thelma’s urging him to “hurry up.” He says, “Dammit, Thelma, don’t holler like that! Haven’t I told you I can’t stand it when you holler in the morning.”            Less than a minute has gone by in the story and we’ve already got a crystal-clear view of these two people and of their relationship. Thelma then replies (sweetly and coyly), I’m sorry, doll, I just didn’t want you to be late.”            Next, Khouri provides the character of Darryl with a very revealing bit of action that informs his character, when she writes: Darryl is checking himself out in the hall mirror and it’s obvious he likes what he sees. He exudes overconfidence for reasons that never become apparent…He is making imperceptible adjustments to his overmoussed hair. (Then, another action by Thelma that further defines her character.) Thelma watches approvingly.            In the briefest span of time, we see these two people for exactly who and what they are. All delivered via their actions (mostly) and a bit of dialogue.            Louise's character is defined even before Thelma's, in the very first scene. She's waiting tables and one of her \"tops\" has a group of teenaged girls, whom she admonishes for smoking, citing the well-worn chestnut that \"smoking will stunt your growth.\" This action informs us of her character and role in the movie—that of the mother. Immediately after she's chastised the girls, she goes into the kitchen for a break and has a cigarette herself. Not only does it define her mothering character, it shows us that she's an unreliable character. She preaches one thing but does another. Pretty much what a normal parent might do!            There are countless other examples of how Callie Khouri defines each and every character by their action—virtually everything the people in her story does defines their characters. There isn’t any “actor’s business for the sake of actor’s business” anywhere in the script. These aren’t things they just “do” while delivering their lines. They do serious plot and story work.            Let’s move on.*                                                          *                                                          *Guns to create character arch*                                                          *                                                          *            Tools and how characters use them are very effective ways to create a character's growth. In Thelma and Louise, one of the most important actions Khouri uses to deliver Thelma’s character arc in the story is when the two women meet at Thelma’s house to begin their trip. Thelma has elected to bring along a revolver and it’s the way she physically handles it that is a particularly brilliant piece of writing by Khouri. Thelma picks up the gun gingerly by the thumb and two fingers, obviously terrified of the weapon when she takes it out of the drawer to pack. That action is reinforced when, minutes later in the car, she reveals to Louise she's brought the weapon and she again holds it as if she's afraid it will go off and shoot her when she follows Louise's order and puts it in the older woman's purse. By the end of the story, she’s whipping the gun around like Doc Holliday’s been mentoring her out behind the O.K. Corral. This one simple action and the way it evolves during the story by itself beautifully shows the viewer how far Thelma’s come and how she’s emerged as a much different person as a result of what she’s undergone.*                                                          *                                                          *Smoking to show character arc*                                                          *                                                          *            However, Khouri doesn’t use just this one action to create a character arc for Thelma. Smoking is another one. We've already talked about Louise toking on a cigarette after she's admonished the teenagers for smoking. At the beginning of the trip, Thelma pantomimes smoking a cigarette, imitating the older and more world-weary Louise. The action is of a child, imitating an adult. As events progress, she eventually becomes a true pro, chain-smoking to beat the band and looking like she’s been at it since she was twelve and a half.            The physical action of smoking is used in many places in this movie to symbolize important points. For instance, after their money has been stolen by J.R. (played by Brad Pitt), Louise has completely given up. Rather than “tell” us she’s quit the good fight, via some awkward dialogue, Khouri uses the physical action of smoking to show us. Waiting in the car, while Thelma goes into a convenience store/gas station (which she’s going to hold up, unbeknownst to Louise), she lights up, takes a desultory half-drag and then tosses the cigarette away. More than any dialogue ever could, this simple action of resignation shows the audience exactly the level of despair Louise has sunk to. She’s given up the only pleasure she had left in life (smoking). A second or two later, she takes out a tube of lipstick and begins to apply it, almost as a lifelong habit in her role as a “woman,” only to toss that away as well. Hard on the heels of giving up smoking, she’s now given up any pretense of being what society deems a woman should be as well as her very life, symbolically. With these two simple actions, we are completely convinced of the complete despair Louise feels. She’s stripped bare of everything. Her old life and old person is gone. It's at this point that she begins to achieve true independence. Only by giving up her old life can she proclaim her right to freedom from the tyranny she's lived under all of her life... from men in particular and from society in general.*                                                          *                                                          *Packing*                                                          *                                                          *            In the setup, both women pack for their camping trip to the mountains. There is a vast contrast to their packing \"styles\" which serves to further define their characters by that action. Louise, the \"mom\" is in control. She wraps garments in individual plastic containers and arranges them neatly in her suitcase. Thelma, in contrast, throws handfuls of clothes into her suitcase and at one point, just dumps her drawers into her suitcase. She's definitely not in control of her life, as evidenced by her chaotic packing method. It mirrors her existence, just as Louise's style does hers. If you knew nothing about either woman, as soon as you saw each of them pack, you'd make the firm conclusion that one was in complete charge of herself and the other was more than a little \"scattered.\" You wouldn't have to hear either of them speak or do anything else to figure this out.            Over and over, actions show us both women and how they evolve. In the beginning, Louise is not only a control freak, she's also obsessed with cleanliness. In fact, there's a scene when the antagonist Hal (played by Harvey Keitel) breaks into Louise's apartment runs his finger over a table surface, looking for dust and there isn't any.            Another scene that reinforces her neatness jones (which is really about the control she practices for her life), is when the women are waiting for drovers to get a herd of cattle around them. \"Don't you scratch my car!\" Louise screams at the men. Later, when they've achieved their freedom, her car is dirty, dusty and just downright filthy... and she doesn't even notice it. Evidence again that her character has evolved.*                                                          *                                                          *Hair*                                                          *                                                          *            Huh? you say. (I heard you.) How is hair a physical action?            Let's take a look.            Remember at the beginning, Khouri has established Louise as the \"in-control\" mother (adult) figure and Thelma as the scattered, undisciplined \"child.\" Louise packs carefully; Thelma tosses her things willy-nilly into the suitcase. Louise smokes; Thelma chomps on a candy bar. Thelma is terrified of guns and Louise is an old hand at firearms. And so on.            Now, look at their hair when the trip begins. Louise's is neat and pinned up. Under firm control. Thelma's hangs loose and free. Hair is important in this movie. Not only does it reflect the individual character at the moment, it also reveals the state of the relationship between the two women at a given point in the plot.            As the story progresses, Louise's hair begins to come down at various plot points. As she inches closer and closer to her freedom from men, the hair comes down, little by little. I won't go into every single scene where hair plays a role, although it does in just about all of them—watch the movie and focus only on the hair and the times when it is up or down or in-between on each woman and you can quickly see how hair affects what's going on and the present state of their relationship with each other.            There is a point, two-thirds through the film, when the two women reverse their roles. Thelma becomes the mother, the one in control, and Louise reverts to being a helpless child. Shortly after that, the two begin to move toward equality and their hair symbolically reflects that stage perfectly, in that both women are driving down the road and both have their hair partly \"up\" in the exact same \"do.\" Not only that, but to further strengthen their new-found equality, they are both singing along in perfect harmony to a song on the radio. All actions.*                                                          *                                                          *Spitbath*                                                          *                                                          *            Let's imagine a hypothetical scene. A mother has just picked up her little girl at the playground and they have to be at the girl's best friend's house for her birthday party. The woman's daughter has grime on her face from the dusty playground. What does the mother do? Why, she gives her a spitbath, of course. That's just what moms do! I know from (painfully embarrassing) personal experience. Who among us hasn't been a player in this familiar drama!            Look at the scene immediately following the killing of Harlan. They're fleeing the scene and then Louise orders Thelma to pull over. Thelma's got gore on her cheeks from the bloody nose Harlan gave her when he slapped her during his attempted rape. What does Louise do? (After she throws up of course, and re-enters the car, ordering Thelma back to the passenger side.) She gives her a spitbath, an action right out of Parenting 101! You can find it on page three.*                                                          *                                                          *Sex*                                                          *                                                          *            I saw your eyes light up at this topic heading. Don't deny it. Just means you're normal.            Sex is powerful, isn't it. We pay attention when we encounter sex on the screen or among the pages of a novel.            Many writers write sizzling sex scenes that are definitely worth the price of admission. But... most of the time, those scenes don't do all that they could. Khouri gets Prius mileage out of her big sex scene, the one where Thelma and J.R. (Brad Pitt) make love. As Janet Burroway tells us in her wonderful book, Writing Fiction (the most widely-used writing textbook used in America), that character changes must always be occasioned by a physical event. Khouri uses this maxim brilliantly.            Up until the point when J.R. steals their money, Louise is in charge—the parent—and Thelma is the child. When they run to the motel room and find out J.R.'s stolen all their money, a role reversal takes place. Louise gives up and reverts to being the child—all hope is gone in her eyes. It is then that a miracle happens. Thelma becomes the parent in charge. (Incidentally, this scene is foreshadowed by an earlier scene in a similar motel room, when Thelma collapses on the bed in tears, clearly the child, and Louise takes charge.) It's Thelma's coming-of-age moment.            How can Thelma change this drastically? Remember, character change must be caused by something physical that happens to the character. Have you guessed what the physical action was that allowed Thelma to do a 180?            Sex.            That's right. But... not just any old sex. After all, she's been married four years and dated her husband Darryl for the four years of high school before that and has had lots of sex. But, what J.R. and she had was a different kind of sex for her. It was adult, mature sex. Not the version of teenager backseat dalliances she engaged in with her husband in high school and then transported to the marital bed. No, this was grownup sex. Sex between adults who approach the act as equals. And, it was because of this that she transformed into an adult and was able to take charge. Without this kind of sex, she would no doubt have stayed the child she was and would have most likely collapsed in surrender and defeat  on the bed right along with Louise, as she'd already done in previous scenes in one way or another up to that moment.            This is the biggest turning point in the movie and the most dramatic moment and Khouri does it up right. First, she makes sure Thelma's defining moment isn't obscured by anything. Louise leaves their room first and it's clear she's going to be having sex herself with her boyfriend Jimmy (the Michael Madsen character). But... we never see even a glimpse of these two between the sheets doing the nasty. Why? Because Khouri wanted to make sure that the most important scene in the story wasn't obscured or overshadowed  in the least which it might have been if we'd been witness to both women and their lovemaking. She’s also being faithful to keeping the story firmly in Thelma’s pov.+                                                          *                                                          *            There are other actions in this fine film that the screenwriter Khouri employs, but these should give you a very good idea of not only how to use such actions to inform your character and his or her developmental arc, but how vital providing them is. In the last chapter, during which we’ll follow the movie frame by frame, I’ll reveal more of these defining actions.            Now. How might we use these techniques for our fiction? Good question! Here's some suggestions.*                                                          *                                                          *Proscription*                                                          *                                                          *            Since Thelma and Louise first hit the movie theaters in 1987, the country has undergone a universal negative change in its attitude toward smoking. That means that it's probably best not to adopt Khouri's ingenious use of cigarettes in your story in an anti-smoking climate. What's kind of interesting is that while smoking has mostly vanished from movies, when it does appear, mostly it signals that this is a \"bad guy.\" Instead of wearing black, the villain these days is puffing on a Marlboro Red. What might you substitute? Well, there are any number of possibilities.            Let's say you're writing a coming-of-age novel or at least a novel with coming-of-age elements and you want something like Khouri's symbol to show the passage of your character from childhood into adulthood. What are some artifacts or actions that we associate primarily with adults and not with children?            One that comes to mind is drinking. If you watched the movie, you'll recall how Khouri has Thelma buying whiskey in those little \"miniatures\" when she was in her role as a child. That's how a kid might buy booze. When she \"grew up\" after experiencing \"adult sex\" with J.R., she switched to regular(adult)-sized bottles. To show your character as achieving adulthood you might show her switching from flavored vodkas to regular martinis, or you might set him up by having him order drinks mixed with colas—say a rum and Coke—to a Jack and water. (Although there seem to be plenty of adults who still enjoy pop in their adult beverages...) A better example might be having your character always running around in t-shirts with athletes' names on the back. To show he's achieved maturity, you could have him toss his Michael Jordan tees and begin wearing shirts without logos or jocks' names on the back. I heard a radio dj commenting on this one day and open it up for discussion among his listeners and the consensus reached was that after the age of thirty, a man just looks silly walking around with another guy's name on his shirt.            The point is to be observant and see what actions kids make that adults don't. In one of my short stories, \"Blue Skies,\" the protagonist experienced an epiphany when he noticed that his mentally-challenged daughter Celsi still ate her sandwiches that were cut diagonally by taking the first bite from the center. He knew she was never going to get better when he and his wife and Celsi were out for her sixteenth birthday and she still took her first bite out of the middle. His observation was that most adults he observed always bit the tip of the sandwich off first.            There are plenty of examples around. Just be observant and you'll find them.            And don't limit yourself to just coming-of-age actions. Use actions for every significant change in your character. For instance, you may want to write a story about a man who has terminal cancer and your story is about the stages such a person might go through in coming to terms with his fate.            Let's say that right after \"Charley\" learns of his impending doom, he goes through a period of utter hopelessness. From that he segues into a kind of hysterical hedonism, where he does everything he's always wanted to do, but was too conservative to do while healthy. From that you may have him moving on to a period in which he takes huge risks with his life. Maybe you have him buy a motorcycle—something he's always wanted but didn't for a couple of reasons. One, he was simply afraid of motorcycles, and two, he didn't feel the family's budget could accommodate one. Now that he's only got months to live, he races out and plunks down a check for a new Harley Sportster. His wife is beside herself. He tears through town at breakneck speed, at little or no concern for his safety. She's really worried because he refuses to buy a helmet. She even goes out and buys him one for his birthday present, but he never puts it on.            And then, something happens. He has an epiphany. (What the epiphany is and how he gets it is your job—you didn't think I was going to write the whole darned thing, did you?) Something happens that somehow gives him hope and makes him come back to earth and realize that even though he's terminal, he's still responsible for his family and that if he were to get in a wreck and survive, the hospital bills might just finish off what little savings they have left. He also gains a small ray of hope that the doctors may be wrong—that he may somehow beat the death sentence.            To show his realization by a physical act, you can have him go to the garage where he's discarded his wife's present and strap on the helmet. He's really grown here, by this kind of action. He didn't revert to where he was before—he's still going to ride his cycle and he isn't overly afraid to do so—but he's going to do it responsibly now.             See how this physical action stuff works? It's kind of cool, isn't it!            Now. Go out and figure out your own actions to give your characters. Your stories will resonate as they never have before.These are the other proposed chapters:SECTION I: CharacterizationChapter 1: Characterization. How actions both inform characterization and provide a dynamic means to create character arc.            Create Memorable 3-D Characters            Giving your characters physical actions to define characters and show character arc.            Physical actions to create character arc.            Actor’s “business” and how it can help or hurt.            How exposition is handled through the “back door” by using details to show character traits without pushing the information into the readers’ faces. (This chapter included)Chapter 2: Protagonists and Antagonists.             Protagonists and antagonists and supporting characters and how their roles work in story. Creating sympathy for the protagonist by piling on trouble. Point-of-view. The multiple povs used in T&L.Chapter 3: Dialogue That Rocks            Dialogue that cooks and sears deeply into the retina of our souls. Why and how \"off-the-nose\" dialogue works and why \"info dumps\" and \"Q and A\" dialogue constructs don't. The value of as well as the danger of using movie dialog as a model for fiction—the things that can prove profitable in writing better dialog and the elements that may be detrimental when not knowing how to look at dialog, including how the “values” of a movie (lighting, big-screen, etc.) can amplify dialog in a way print cannot. How subtext provides the highest form of dialog.            A common misconception: Why many times film dialogue doesn't work in a fiction setting and shouldn't be used as a model (a look at how production values can distort the value of a film example.) Chapter 4: Emotional response.            Understated works better than melodrama. Lowering the volume creates drama; raising it creates melodrama.            The \"daydream\" vs the Jungian \"nightdream\": how one is based on cheap sentimentality and the second on honest, earned emotion.Chapter 5: Activate the Six SensesWhat senses are being neglected? A fool-proof exercise to include all five. SECTION II: Story StructureChapter 6: Structure Your Novel Like a Movie            Three-act structure of drama works for the novel            Inciting incidents. How a plot is created via causal events.Chapter 7: Set The MoodWhere in the world are we? Give enough details to establish time and place, then allow readers to make their own “leaps.”  Chapter 8: Backstory/setup.            How backstory—the \"kiss of death\" in a novel if this is the first thing the reader encounters—is handled in the hands of a master like Callie Khouri in Thelma & Louise. Chapter 9: How to Write Riveting Scenes            Enter late and leave early. How to set future scenes up by foreshadowing.Chapter 10: Apply the Principles of Mise en Scene to Your Novel            How to utilize setting to define character.            Create opposing settings that powerfully illustrate character contrasts.            Use specified “visual” evidence to show how the use of space changes over time.  Using weather as a “character.”            How a building can influence a story.            Chapter 11: Transitions            How transitions have changed in fiction, chiefly due to movies. In the \"olden days\" of filmdom, transitions were handled much as they were in fiction; with subtitles and formal \"pronouncements\" on placards that, \"Now, we are leaving Mary Jane and her troubles with her father and traveling back to where all the conflict began, back in her childhood.\" Nowadays, there are no transitions as in days of yore, because today the movies just \"goes\" to the next scene (jump cuts), sans any explanation or lead-in, and audiences have learned to adjust and \"get\" what's happening. Fiction needs to do the same thing (and the good stories do), but alas, many teachers still drum archaic transitional techniques into their students' heads, at the expense of having their stories fail due to the musty, \"old-timey\" feel of the fictions utilizing such techniques.Chapter 12: Surface-problem and story-worthy problem.            How each is related and resolved. How the story-worthy problem is not made manifest to the protagonist until very near the end and how the viewer/reader may not even be conscious of the story-worthy problem, but instead many times assimilates it subconsciously. Why even though the reader may not be aware of the story-worthy problem, the author has to be.Chapter 13: Create Story Endings that Pack a Punch and Resonate with the Reader            Write resolutions that satisfy emotionally. How good endings contain both a win and a loss for the protagonist.                        SECTION III: What Helps Sell Your FictionChapter 14: Create “Sizzle” in Your Novel            Learn how Hollywood creates buzz            What a “set piece” is and how they’re constructed            Why “watercooler moments” are the easiest way to sell your novel and absolutely essential in creating a bestseller.            How to use those moments to sell your novel to an agent            How to create 3-8 “set pieces” or “watercooler moments”            Examination of eight watercooler moments from Thelma and Louise            Create “Aha!” moments and “inside information” for your readers to discover.            How subtleties in your novel can tremendously improve its complexity and appeal for discerning readers.Chapter 15: Take a Tip From the Movie Moguls—Pitch Like a Pro            Pitch like the pros: What to do—and what to avoid when you meet with an agent to pitch your novel.            Real life examples of successful—and unsuccessful—pitch meetings.            Create titles that sizzle. Short is usually best. Follow the lead of movie marketing wherein titles are usually created with brevity in mind (to fit on the marquee and also to provide a short title that’s easy to remember when people are talking about it).SECTION IVChapter 16: Watching the movie, frame-by-frame.            Here, we’ll go through the entire movie as it plays, noting the important elements as we’ve learned them in the preceding chapters and observe how it all comes together to create a story.EpilogueIndexThank you so very much! I've been working on this book for over ten years and I truly think this can be a book writers will find valuable.Blue skies,Les"},

{"title": "Student writing problems", "date": "Thursday, October 7, 2010", "text": "Nothing to do with this post, but I just wanted to share this photo of my team, the S.F. Giants winning the NL West Division Title. This is Buster Posey rounding the bases after his home run. You know--the Buster Posey who deserves to be named Rookie of the Year... Go Giants!Hi folks,Thought I’d address some writing issues today. A student of mine has been undergoing a tough time trying to nail her novel opening and contacted me about her problems. I think what she’s going through is fairly common among beginning writers, so I thought perhaps seeing our exchange might be beneficial to others who face the same problems. I’ll call her “Suzy” below.Suzy: I’m taking a week off from class in an effort to re-group and find a way to attack this thing (inciting incident) from a different angle.Les: Sometimes, that’s a good idea. To just step back, take a deep breath, and recharge your batteries for a new perspective.Suzy: Quite frankly, I seriously considered just dropping the class… too bad I’m not a quitter.Les: I’m glad you’re not a quitter, too, Suzy. And, you aren’t. Quitting is the single biggest reason people never become writers. It’s a tough craft and there’s no place in it for wimps. Good on you! There’s an axiom in writing—if anyone can convince a writer he or she can’t write, then that person was never going to be a writer anyway. It’s extremely difficult to write well, which is why so few, comparatively, ever get published. Why self-publishing is becoming so big—there’s not much talent or hard work involved. What most of these folks are doing isn’t writing—it’s typing. We find ourselves in an instant gratification society where people don’t expect to have to work very hard to find success—the feeling is that they’re “entitled” to success.A well-known agent recently posed a question on his blog as to whether or not his readers would consider self-publishing. Some of the comments were instructive. One guy said that he wouldn’t consider anything but self-publishing. That publishers never appreciated his excellent writing, etc. Only problem was his post was full of misspellings and syntax errors. Perhaps his “excellent” writing didn’t include spelling, punctuation and grammar as necessary elements… Another even claimed there was a racial bias in publishing and it was because he was a black guy that no one would publish his work. Give me a break!Suzy: I have a feeling you think your instruction is falling on deaf ears with me but that is not the case.Les: I don’t think that at all. Although, when format errors keep cropping up, like the two spaces between sentences, I have to say that—yeah, that feels like it’s falling on deaf ears. The thing about proper format is that a person doesn’t have to have writing talent to follow professional format—it’s a simple mechanical thing—and when it’s not followed, it shows a lack of respect for the craft. It also shows a lack of respect for the work, the writer, and the professional submitted to. So, I won’t give a pass on that. Especially after six weeks! Fair enough? (Note: I insist on proper format for all submissions and this student had a history of sending in material improperly formatted, with the same mistakes over and over. I won’t tolerate that at all.)Suzy: I have honestly tried to incorporate your feedback in my work—with lackluster results.Les: Much of the problem with your story is that you’re leaving out vital information for the reader. It’s not your writing at all. Your writing ability is superlative, in fact. But, writing well is more than just creating scenes—it’s storytelling and has to be logical in many ways.Suzy: I'll admit that I have very strong ideas about where I want this novel to go and I am finding it difficult to let go of them but I am trying.Les: Can’t comment on that as I don’t know what you’re “letting go.” But, it’s vital that your story begin properly and that means it has to begin with trouble (i.e., the inciting incident that creates and/or reveals her story problem to her) so that the reader sees clearly that she’s got a compelling problem. The reader won’t “take the narrator’s word” that there’s a problem. The reader won’t buy she has a problem simply by seeing her react emotionally to something we don’t see. We have to clearly see the problem the same as she does. Where you’re going wrong is that you know the story (as author) and you’re showing the character reacting to something you know, but that the reader doesn’t as it’s not on the page for them to witness. All we see is her reaction to something we don’t see or have knowledge of. Anything and everything your narrator/protagonist knows that’s important has to be made clear to the reader. For instance, the problem last time is that we see Nancy all in a lather over this jogger, but we’re never given the reason for her emotional reaction. It looks like she recognizes him, but we are never told who he is, what threat he represents, or any of that. This is being cryptic, by withholding necessary information from the reader that the narrator knows but isn’t sharing. To the intelligent reader, this shows clearly that they are being manipulated by the writer.Suzy: I have never intentionally been cryptic in my writing—I just can't seem to find the balance between \"trusting the reader's intelligence\" and \"dumbing down my prose.\"Les: It’s not dumbing down the prose to let us know why and what this jogger represents. We absolutely have to know what she knows to understand why this is a story problem. You’re trying to show by a reaction to something not revealed that it’s a problem for her and no reader will accept that without knowing why the appearance of this person affects her, nor should they. Suzy: The problem might be that I have never written for an audience before—it has always been for myself and since I already know the whole story, I don’t fully explain what’s going on. Les: As writers, we do write for an audience—unless we mean to keep our stories locked in a drawer. And, that’s not the purview of a class like this. The problem is, no reader is going to follow a character who only shows reactions to stuff we’re not privy to. We have to see and understand clearly what she sees and knows about this guy.Suzy: Whatever the problem may be, I accept that it is mine and that if I want to succeed as a writer, I will have to figure it out and solve it. There is no ego here--just a desire to make this work. I understand that it's necessary to tell me what's not working and while I appreciate the feedback, I'd really like to know what (if anything) IS working--it would help to have a point of reference between what I'm doing right and what I'm doing wrong. I'd like to thank you for your hard work and dedication to us all. It's obvious that you care a great deal about all of our success.Les: I really do, Suzy. Believe me, I want desperately to tell everyone that they’re doing fine, but that would be a compromise… actually, an out-and-out lie if they’re not—and I refuse to compromise. Out entire society has become a compromising society and I’m just not buying in. Writing well is hard work and the competition’s too tough to settle for less. As for what you’re doing right—well, lots of things. You really are a good writer, but you need to work on creating a story that an audience will be attracted to. In other words, story structure is what you need to work on and you are. Part of the problem is the way writing is generally taught in high school and in college. Lots of exercises. One on dialog, one on description, one on characterization, etc., etc. But, very little, if any time, is spent on story structure. What makes a story a story. The reason story isn’t taught much or well is twofold: 1. Many teachers are lazy. Period. Please note that I said “many” and not “all.” There are some truly excellent teachers out there. But, for many, it’s infinitely easier to give the class an assignment on say description and have the little buggers write three-four paragraphs on description. (Usually passive description which has long vanished from contemporary stories.) The class is kept busy and at the end, they turn in all of these poetic descriptions. How they fit into story is rarely discussed. They’ve learned a “piece” of writing and it’s not a difficult teaching chore at all. All he or she has to do is say, “Here’s some examples of great descriptions, here’s a thesaurus, and go, you cool kids! Yay, siss-boom, rah!” Same with dialog or anything else. The student becomes good at writing pieces of writing… but is never shown how they fit the overall mosaic of writing and of story. They’re working on… pieces of writing. 2. The second reason is that many teachers don’t understand story themselves—they’re the result of the same teaching methods themselves and that’s all they know. And, it’s just easy to keep parroting the same stuff you’ve learned yourself.Look at how novels are discussed in class as a rule. Usually parts of the book are discussed. They talk about “themes” for crying out loud! Themes! Something a writer should never pay attention to except perhaps during rewrites. Metaphors and similes. Yuch… Almost never as a whole, as an entire story and how all of the pieces are put together to make a whole. So, students again are learning pieces and parts. We learn all about sirloin steaks but never about the steer. It’s kind of like practicing the scales and expecting to get to Carnegie Hall. Playing the scales perfectly or any number of little exercises performed however exquisitively just won’t get a musician to Carnegie Hall, I’m afraid… unless they buy a ticket. To get to Carnegie Hall requires the musician write a symphony… not part of a symphony. Same with a novel. No publisher is buying parts of writing. Slices of life, for instance, don’t enjoy any market at all.This is the circumstance of quite a few young writers, I believe. And, while it may be true, it doesn’t do anybody much good to sit around and bemoan it and feel sorry for ourselves because we were cheated out of a proper education of writing. Nothing can be done about what happened yesterday. We’ve got today and (hopefully) tomorrow and all we can do is address the holes in our craft knowledge base and that’s what we’re doing here. The good news is that once we address and fill in those holes, we’re going to become that most wondrous thing in the universe—a writer.Just keep in mind—anything easily won or achieved usually isn’t worth much. Something that takes blood, sweat and tears has value.The lessons I’m trying to get across here aren’t just for the beginning of your novel. They apply to the entire novel. Once a writer learns how to create a good opening, the rest of the novel becomes infinitely easier and infinitely better written. Not only that—the time spent in achieving a good beginning will result in the rest of it being written much faster (and with a much higher quality) than would have been achieved prior to learning those lessons. Resulting in a novel that has a realistic chance of getting published.Suzy, to make your opening work, you only need to make it clear what seeing Jim represents to your protagonist. What does it mean about “being found.” We simply need to know what she knows and know exactly why seeing him jogging creates a story problem for her. That’s what’s missing. You can’t just show her being emotionally distraught without showing us why. Once we see what she sees and knows, then we’ll be involved emotionally in the scene and it works.Hope this helps, Suzy!Blue skies,LesThis is a fairly typical response to student questions and issues raised. Suzy (not her real name—it’s not my intent to put anyone on Front Street) is an excellent student and excellent writer. She’s just having trouble with her beginning, which, as a beginner, doesn’t realize is quite common. Even seasoned pros have trouble writing great beginnings at times. What’s reassuring about her as a writer is that she won’t give up and that’s why I know she’ll succeed eventually.I’m posting this because I’ve found that one person’s problem is usually shared by many others, and my hope is that my responses here might be of some value to those folks. Hope so!"},
{"title": "HIORROR MOVIES", "date": "Friday, October 1, 2010", "text": "Part of the clean-up crew for horror movies. Their motto? Leave the set clean enough to eat on!One of the folks who commented on the post on movies that get it wrong and TV personalities who rely only clichés for their vocabularies brought up another rich source of “foot in mouth” disease. Horror movies! Immediately, I knew I had to address this category! (And thanks, Stephonavich.)I haven’t attended horror movies since around the age of seven or eight, and they may have changed in the many several few decades since then. But, I have a feeling from listening to the conversations of those who do attend that they’re pretty much the same. I’m hoping readers will chime in and let me know that they’ve changed for the better, and I’ll be there at the Multi-Plex tomorrow.What I mostly remember are films where there's these college kids who don't go to Padre Island or Florida, but opt instead of the Dismal Swamp, which makes them suspect to begin with. The smart college kids seem to gravitate toward warm beaches and sunshine. Not these Mensa candidates.They arrive at the aforementioned Dismal Swamp, located somewhere that looks a lot like the rainy season in the Badlands of North Dakota (or wherever they are), and unload the Land Rover. (Here’s hoping they brought plenty of blankets and fleece-lined jackets and mosquito repellent…) Then, five minutes into the movie, one of the girls finds a head floating in the toilet, lets out a scream, and five minutes later, all is back to normal. (How does she think that head got there? Somebody barfed and the lid fell down?) They all talk it out and decide a single unattached head swirling around with the Baby Ruths in the stool isn’t enough to make them leave. After all, they’ve put down a sizable deposit on this vacation!Then, the killing really starts. The bad guy or monster (or whatever he prefers to be called) sees that he hasn’t scared off the kids and all they’re interested in is a kind of soap opera where “Sally likes Bobby but Vanessa does too and isn’t it terrible how Mayva can’t seem to commit to Steve and Jerry Joe just wants to go to bed with everybody and…\" All of these giggling, scantily-clad coeds and their boyfriends who all look as if they spend roughly twelve hours a day in the weight room (nerds aren’t allowed on these spring break vacations), are cramping the bad guy’s style and he wants them to leave. So, he drops a hint or two. First, he leaves the head in the toilet. That doesn’t work—these are stubborn kids! There’s that deposit thing…Then, one by one, they get killed and this causes quite a stir as you can imagine! All they have to do is jump into the Land Rover and leave, but this option never seems to come up in their ad hoc board meetings out by the campfire. No, by gum, they paid their deposit and they're not leaving! One by one, they get killed and the last one is always the blonde with the tightest hot pants. She's running like Derek Jeter stealing a base... and the bad guy runs like Brer Turtle... and he's catching her! Which brings me to…The bad guy!The bad guy is six-foot-nine, wears a hockey mask, is always covered with blood and breathes funny. He obviously has an asthma problem but he’s in denial as we never see him carting around an oxygen tank or even using an inhaler. He just goes on wheezing through his hockey mask. He’s obviously a victim of second-hand smoke since no one has ever seen him smoking a Marlboro.He lives in a town smaller than Mayberry and has lived there through nineteen movies. What I can’t understand is… doesn’t the police force in this town ever attend a seminar or watch a training film? Or even see a CSI episode? Why can’t they catch this guy? He’s six-foot-nine, wears a hockey mask everywhere he goes (but, we never see him playing…), and is smeared with coed and weight-lifter’s blood. Doesn’t he have to go to the 7-11 at least occasionally for a loaf of bread or a Slurpie? I live in this town and with the first burglary I’m moving. These guys couldn't catch a cold. This has to be the “Town of Coffee Shops.” Where else could the cops be? Attending to the parking ticket crime wave?They’re there. We always see them at the end, arriving to pick up the bodies and shake their heads at the carnage. Perhaps they should invest in a calendar and mark the spring break period and maybe do a patrol or two during this annual bloodfest?Perhaps… and this is my cynical side coming out… perhaps, they know he’s there, rendering college kids room temperature, but they choose not to do anything, because the town’s economy is based on this happening each year! Don’t laugh—hear me out. This is not as far-fetched as it sounds.Every single year, a movie crew is going to descend on the town. The motels, the bed-and-breakfast joints, the restaurants, are all going to do a gold rush business. The studio is going to pay the city fathers a sum for the filming rights. They’re going to pay the guy who owns the farm they film on… and he’s the mayor! See where I’m going? Always follow the money. The local funeral home! My God! Look at the bucks this guy stands to make! Everybody knows movie stars and producers and directors and other Hollywood types are all lushes and drug addicts. Ever hear of Lindsey Lohan? The bar owners are going to get rich, the drug dealers are going to get richer, and the town prostitute is going to have her dance card filled up just on camera operators’ action. No wonder they don’t want to catch this guy! He supports the town. I’ll bet if an intrepid reporter stuck around after the last body is buried, he’d see the bad guy down at the 7-11 and the president of the Chamber of Commerce giving him free Slurpies and slapping him on the back!By the time the movie is down to the last hot-pants-clad hottie, the audience is cheering for the bad guy. All of the college students have demonstrated that they all came from the low end of the gene pool. These folks may procreate and that's the real scary part of the movie. At any point during the festivities, all these fun-loving partiers have to do to save themselves is simply jump in the Land Rover and drive away. Do they? Ha! You know the answer to that already. Of course not. They’d lose their deposit.And, who is always the very last one to be killed? The blondest girl. The blondest girl with the shortest hot pants. In the final scene, she’s getting chased by the bad guy and she runs faster than Secretariat. The bad guy mostly lumbers along at the rate of government reform. You realize your grandmother in her walker could spot him a city block in a race and beat him by six lengths. Yet… he’s catching her! How does this happen? It dawns on you. She’s got rabbit genes. She’s running like a rabbit—in circles. How else could he catch her?This is why I don’t pay money to watch horror movies.

{"title": "Potpourri", "date": "Tuesday, September 28, 2010", "text": "Hi folks,Thought I’d post a bit of potpourri today and perhaps get some reactions. First, going along with the recent post on how Hollywood kind of “gets it wrong” many times, here’s a recent email a former student of mine from when I taught at the University of Toledo and good friend, Kat Hacker sent me, about Hollywood and their products:Kat writes: This list is kind of clever (I did not write it.)Unexpected knowledge gained from the movies:1) During all police investigations, it will be necessary to visit a strip club at least once.2) All grocery shopping bags contain at least one stick of French bread.3) The Eiffel Tower can be seen from any window in Paris.4) Even when driving down a perfectly straight road, it is necessary to turn the steering wheel vigorously from left to right every few moments.5) When you turn out the light to go to bed, everything in your bedroom should still be clearly visible, just slightly bluish. All beds have special L-shaped cover sheets that reach up to the armpit level on a woman but only to waist level on the man lying beside her.6) Should you decide to defuse a bomb, don't worry which wire to cut. You will always choose the right one.7) It does not matter if you are heavily outnumbered in a fight involving martial arts--your enemies will wait patiently to attack you one by one by dancing around in a threatening manner until you have knocked out their predecessors.8) A man will show no pain while taking the most ferocious beating but will wince when a woman tries to clean his wounds.I have a few of my own:1) Every time a car is shot at, it will blow up when a bullet hits the gas tank. And, a bullet will always hit the gas tank. This is a remarkable event, especially considering that bullets don’t have nearly enough heat to ignite gasoline and this has never happened in real life.2) Every time a car goes over a cliff, it will blow up.3) Every time a car blows up, the explosion will be of a magnitude that it would require at least 100 gallons of gas to get a fireball that big. A stick of dynamite blowing up is a puny explosion compared to a car blowing up. Cars in movies that blow up have obviously just been filled up. They are still filled up even though the explosion occurs after a high-speed car chase of many miles. One wishes they offered cars with this kind of gas mileage to the general public.4) Every time a car hits a guard rail on a cliff, it will go right through it. You’d think that state highway departments would watch movies, learn this is what happens, and perhaps use a higher grade of steel in guard rails…5) Criminals obviously never watch movies as they don’t seem to realize that bullet-proof vests only cover the chest. The chest is the only area they are allowed to aim at, it appears. The head is off-limits, as is the groin area or legs or arms. Personally, I’d rather have a steel “cup” than a chest vest… If my goodies are hit, I imagine I’d rather be dead…6) While even a .45 has enough power to kill a person if the person is hit in the hand (the shock can kill and does), .357 magnum rounds can hit a person in the shoulder and only have about a half-inch wound in circumference, and after the person is hit, he conveniently lives long enough to be able to deliver his lines. In theater parlance, this is known as \"being a trooper.\"7) If a gas tanker is seen in a movie, you can count on it that it will get blown up. You’d think that tanker drivers would have seen movies and if they ever saw anyone filming them, they’d abandon the truck and go get pie and coffee in a truck stop until the cameraman left.8) Many times, when a car blows up, it blows up at least a couple more times after the initial explosion. It would seem to indicate the car had at least one auxiliary tank or perhaps the driver had gone for lawn mower gas just before his car was shot and it’s the gas can that blew up in the secondary explosion. And,  judging from the size of the secondary explosion, that must have been a 75-gallon gas can...9) When a car or building blow up, and the hero and his love interest are within a few yards of it, they are blown backwards and then get up slowly and brush themselves off. Their eyebrows are never burned off or even slightly singed. In our own experience, when the backyard barbecue flares up briefly, we lose our eyebrows. How is it possible a mega-explosion never affects actor’s eyebrows? Rhetorical question. The answer is, in a standard actor's contract, it states that while the role may call for bodily damage in every part of the body unit, the eyebrows are sacred territory and can never be damaged. As famous movie star Bette Davis stated: \"My eyebrows are my livelihood.\"10) Where did the canted pistol aim originate from with gangs doing drive-bys? Was the guy who started all that maybe cock-eyed? Perhaps this is where the famous movie phrase, “Are you talking to me?” originated from…It would be fun to hear your own personal favorites. My son Mike and me on MSNBC-NEWS doing our part to keep cliches alive...For the second part of this post, I’d like to ask folks to send in their own examples of:Phrases that drive me nuts that we hear over and over from TV news anchors, sports reporters, and politico commentators that suggest they might want to enlarge their vocabularies… or maybe even get one…At the end of the day… (Guess it doesn’t matter what happens at noon…)(This happens)… and we’re having a different conversation now… (Master of the obvious…)(Somebody) needs to step up to the plate. (And do what?)The 800-pound gorilla in the room… (That has to be Sasquatch. “Regular” gorillas only weigh 300-400 pounds…)The dead cat bounce… (PETA, where are you when we really need you?)Drink the Kool-Aid. (I bet the Kool-Aid folks wish this one would disappear…)(He) knocked it out of the park. (And the announcer said, “Foul ball…”)Think outside of the box. (I’d like to see what’s in the box, first…)The ball is in his court. (And?)At the eleventh hour. (This must be just before “the end of the day.”)Illegal immigrant. (Whatever happened to illegal alien? That’s what they are.)To be perfectly candid. (As opposed to what? Imperfectly obtuse?)It’s a win-win situation. (Or a lose-win? Or a lose-lose? Or a win-lose?)Going forward… (Sideways isn’t an option?)Push the envelope… (Okay. Then what? It’s pushed. Does it need a stamp?)Let’s take this off-line… (Can’t. My ‘puter crashed…)The bottom line. (I’m dying to see the next-to-the-bottom line…)Has legs and can really go far. (Better than visualizing someone pulling themselves along with their arms on the ground, I suppose…)Transparency. (Oh, like the government, right?)Game changer. (I know we agreed to play tag, but now we’re going to play hide ‘n seek…)When the rubber meets the road. (All I can say about this one is… never trust rubber…)Yes AND No. (Make a decision.)Multitasking. (Like walking and chewing gum at the same time?)Reinvented. (Can’t something only be invented once?)To tell the honest truth. (As opposed to what? The dishonest truth?)Thanks for the heads-up. (I was wearing it between my knees and never noticed…)If we took all of these and the other clichés out of the mouths of TV folks, we might as well hit the “Mute” button…Let’s see your own favorites. Or… unfavorites…To be perfectly candid, I guess that at the end of the day, near the eleventh hour, and to tell the honest truth, if someone doesn’t see the 800-pound gorilla in the room multitasking and reinventing the dead cat bounce, we’re having a different conversation, and obviously thinking outside of the box, which, at least theoretically, could result in a win-win situation—a real game-changer, where the rubber meets the road. Bottom line? Going forward, let’s take this offline, so I can drink the Kool-Aid and become truly transparent, i.e., room temperature… The ball’s in your court.Dude…"},
{"title": "“REAL” CHARACTERS AS OPPOSED TO “HOLLYWOOD” CHARACTERS:  NOIR RULES", "date": "Monday, September 20, 2010", "text": "Hi folks,An edited version of this came out today at www.mulhollandbooks.com (Little, Brown's website for their new imprint, headed up by John Schoenfelder), and I thought you might be interested in the unexpurgated version.I count it as an honor that they asked me to submit an essay to them--the leading thriller and noir writers in the country are who usually grace this site, and this was heady company for me.Mulholland Books is also one of the places considering my latest novel, THE BITCH, and it would be really cool to be published by them.Anyway... hope you enjoy this.              As writers, each of us comes to our choice of this craft from different avenues and all of us have different motivations and agendas, based on any number of factors. Our life experience is perhaps the largest factor and that involves not only our childhood experiences and relationships, but that English teacher in the fourth grade who encouraged us (or discouraged us—as psychology students learn, there are two possible ways to get the rat to run the maze—punishment or reward). Writing, to my mind, is one endeavor that doesn’t fall under the genetics/environment argument. I don’t believe in something called “the born writer.” If there were such a thing, why didn’t Native Americans and other similar cultures ever produce a single writer before the white man took over the real estate? Story-tellers, yes, absolutely. But, no writers.            In fact, as a writer, accuracy is important to me, and it’s why I walked out of the movie Dances With Wolves. A third of the way through, a group of Indian boys have stolen Kevin Costner’s horse (obviously not aware of his iconic Hollywood status) and are riding back to their camp. Subtitles inform us of what they’re shouting. One boy yelled, “They’ll write songs about us!” (Italics mine.) Well, not one single North American Indian tribe had the word “write” in their vocabulary; indeed, the concept of writing didn’t exist prior to the white man becoming the landlord. From that moment forward, my disbelief became unsuspended, and I couldn’t buy any of the rest of the movie.            I looked up the original screenplay and the writer had it right. He’d written: “They’ll sing songs about us.” The writer got it right and the director or editor or whoever changed it. Happens to us writer-types all the time.            The point I’m trying to make is that writing isn’t a result of genetics. It’s something created by environment. The additional point is that a writer should watch editors very carefully…            In my case, I’m just following the dictum, “Write what you know.”            Well… Les knows crime. I spent a considerable portion of my life doing crime stuff. Even spent two-plus years in prison, in one of Indiana’s then-two maximum security prisons, Pendleton, back in the sixties on a 2-5 for second-degree burglary. Did other things afterward, including dealing drugs, using drugs, working as an escort for wealthy women, was shot at and shot back, was involved in high-speed chases with the cops, lived with a call girl whose clientele involved people you’d recognize from People Magazine, was homeless, was involved in stabbings, check-kiting, strong-armed robberies, and some other tricks and stratagems of the hustling trade.            I also have this weird desire to write true accounts of the criminal mind in novels, something I’ve seen very little of. In fact, the only accurate depiction of the criminal mind I’ve ever seen in a movie was the Woody Harrelson character in Natural Born Killers. Although, it seems that movie turned off a lot of folks, who prefer their criminals depicted in a more romantic and Hollywoodish fashion. In Glitter Town, most filmmakers would have Harrelson love cats or something equally insipid. And, yes, I know—it was a Hollywood movie, but an aberration. Very few novels, other than true noir, ever come close. One of the best novels that gave us a true account of how people become criminals was Scott Smith’s A Simple Plan.            To be honest, most novels and films don’t seem to come even remotely close to a realistic interpretation of the criminal mind. That’s changing these days as noir makes a comeback.            What’s the reason most miss the true nature of the criminal mind? That’s easy. Most who write have never been criminals. And, there’s no one to call them out on the inaccuracies as very few criminals read all that much for several reasons. One, limited access to books. When I was in Pendleton, our “library” consisted mostly of Zane Grey paperbacks and was housed in an oversized closet. Two, most inmates are poorly-educated. Again, when I was in Pendleton, the average educational level was third-grade. Therefore, the only people with critical acumen in the subject, don’t have much of a voice or easy entre to the NY Times Book Review.            The same situation exists in the Mafia. Anyone who has known many Costa Nostra types personally knows that most of these guys aren’t going to cure cancer, split the atom, or invent gravity. The greater numbers are mouth-breathing mesomophs, with the I.Q. power of candles and the achieved educational level of gnats.            When Mario Puzo wrote The Godfather, he admitted he’d never met a mafiosa. He confessed he’d made just about all the stuff in the book up. He had to. He was living in Connecticut, surrounded by life insurance executives and stock brokers and typing on a door suspended on two sawhorses in his spacious, well-appointed garage. (He said in an interview that if he’d known it was going to be a big hit, he’d have “written it better,”) The “sleeping with the fishes,” the “horsehead” stuff, the “hitting the mattresses” stuff, all came out of his imagination. What happened was the guys in the Mob liked his depiction of them—even though it was all b.s.—as it greatly romanticized them and made them look… human?—even as cool humans?—that they adopted the persona. They adopted the language in the novel (well, most didn’t read well enough to read the novel—most just saw the movie) and life imitated art. Now, until another movie comes out, most mafia guys are going to be cracking wise until they day they “sleep with the fishes” with the bon mots they observed Al Pacino uttering. It’ll have to be a different movie, though, as everything that followed The Godfather seems to have used the same casting director.            Same thing happens with most criminals when they read a thriller. They adopt the role they see on the page or up on the screen. Most criminals look like your neighbor the accountant in the split-level down the block, but thanks to movies and thrillers, the average citizen is certain that they look either like Steve Buscemi or Samuel Jackson, and that the average warden looks like Robert Redford. Not my experience…            Let’s look at three of the most common inaccuracies:1. Inmates in prison hate child molesters.            Mostly hooey. It seems to be common wisdom these days that people on the bricks (”straights”) believe that inmates in prison hate child molesters and can’t wait to kill them. I disagree… to a point. Back in my time in prison (mid-sixties in a state joint, which is vastly different than a federal prison), nobody much cared about what you were in for. Actually, there weren’t many child molesters back then-child molestations, while they’ve always been around are infinitely more common these days than back then--but as long as they minded their business no one really bothered them or cared what they’d done. I can only remember knowing of one inmate who was a convicted child molester and nobody bothered him or much cared what he was in for. To be honest, a large number of people incarcerated have drinking or drug problems and when they’re on the sauce or high, pretty routinely abuse their own kids.2. Inmates hate convicted cops.            Again, hooey. The few cops that were in the joint with me had more friends than anyone else, on average. The thing is, cops and outlaws interact with each other all the time on the bricks--at least the professional criminals do--and most of us like and even respect each other. There’s a very fine line between being a cop and a criminal, in my opinion. We’re both adrenaline junkies and is one of the chief reasons we become what we are in these two “career fields.” When I was “in the life” I used to hang out almost every night at a slop shop in downtown South Bend, before I went to “work,” and half the people there were off-duty cops and half were outlaws. We all got along well and if one of those guys got sent up, we were still friends.3. Inmates claim to be innocent.            This is probably the biggest myth of all. Nobody claims to be innocent in the joint--even those few who are. If you were innocent and said so to other inmates, they would take that as a sign of weakness and you’d be in trouble. Where that comes from is when a reporter or researcher interviews an inmate, very often they’ll sing him a sad tale of woe about being bumrapped. The reason is, no matter how guilty the person is, once you’re inside, all hope has vanished. To be interviewed, especially by a sympathetic listener, the hope rises that enough bleeding hearts will read the article or see the show and be moved to do something to get the guy liberated. That it doesn’t happen doesn’t destroy the hope--they know it’s a long shot anything like that will happen, but it’s a glimmer of a hope and so they bring their acting chops to the table--probably even claim to have one of those b.s. “jailhouse conversions” and hope somehow their “story” (and that’s usually what it is--a story)--will affect the right people’s hearts and a miracle will happen. I only knew one person when I was in who was truly innocent and there’s no way he would have claimed that to other inmates unless he really trusted they wouldn’t tell anyone else. That’d be suicide. In fact, when those who appear in documentaries and TV shows claim their innocence, the instant they’re back in the cellhouse they make sure to let everyone know they were just pulling a shuck.            Another thing they don’t publicize as it would destroy the common misconception. Of all those people who get freed from prison after an investigation or new trial, probably 90-some percent aren’t freed because they were found innocent. They’re freed because of a legal technicality. You can look that up.            For points #1 and #2, what I suspect has happened to lead to the hatred for child molesters and cops inside the walls is what has happened in just about all the instances of misconceptions about convicts. I think what’s happened is that movies and the media romanticized this (inmates hating and killing child molesters) and inmates bought into this image of themselves for a variety of reasons–-a typical reason being that people in prison are just plain looking for any kind of excuse to shank someone and this is as good a reason as any and even kind of makes the guy shanking a child molester look like a good or moral guy.            The same thing happened with the cops being in danger in the joint myth. Some individual somewhere told a reporter that and the naive reporter (there’s a lot of those folks!) reported it as gospel and just like the child molester myth, that just gave cons an excuse to shank someone and feel “moral.” Now, of course, thanks to television and the movies, convicted cops are in danger.            Even worse is the image MSNBC-NEWS is portraying in their prison series of criminals. If a person was to believe what they see on those shows, they’d assume the average inmate is an obsessed weight-lifter or a raging psycho who spends his day fingerpainting with feces between meetings with the Aryan Nation or Black Panthers or Mexican Mafia and learning the secret handshake. And, they’re all doing life… This series is helping create the biggest misconception of criminals in the history of media--the mindset that doesn’t understand the difference between drama and melodrama, except to know that melodrama boosts ratings.            The truth is, if you put the average cellblock population in a mall food court, nobody would look twice. You’d just see folks mostly like your neighbors. Actually, most of those in jail were your neighbors at one time.            This is why noir rocks. We see a far greater number of realistic characters in their pages. This is also why it has suffered as a genre for so long. It’s too truthful for some. My experience is that the average person is fascinated by criminals… so long as they can appear to get close but get none of that criminality nastiness on themselves. When the criminal mind is accurately depicted, they begin to sense that these guys aren’t as different as they thought.            That’s scary.            And makes for great literature.*                                                          *                                                          *            There’s one other thing that noir has going for itself. It isn’t all that concerned with that abomination called being “politically correct.” That, in itself, is a compelling reason to read and write it."},
{"title": "A MAJOR FLAW IN TEACHING CREATIVE WRITING (FICTION) EFFECTIVELY LIES IN OUR TERMINOLOGY", "date": "Friday, September 10, 2010", "text": "What we say ain’t always what we mean…  I read a lot of blogs from other writers, agents, editors and other professionals in the writing game, and I read a lot of letters from writers responding to those posts. Alas, again and again, I see some general misconceptions about writing techniques and story structure that I’d like to address.I see the same misconceptions from my students in my online classes and from clients I work with.The misconceptions seem to arrive from misunderstanding the definitions of the terms we employ in describing fiction writing and fiction techniques.I’ve come to believe that much of the misunderstandings writers have stem from the fact that many of our terms are lay terms, and while the definitions assigned certain terms have their root in “lay” or “dictionary” definitions, there are significant differences when applied to writing, and it is these differences that cause a certain amount of confusion.That sounds like a lot of goobly-gook, doesn’t it? Sorry! I’ll try to explain better.A good example of what I’m talking about that I’ve seen a lot written about lately refers to the term “action” in fiction. A non-writer usually thinks of action in reference to drama—books, movies, plays, and television—as some kind of physical activity. Many times, the word evokes images of melodrama—bombings, kidnappings, shootings, stabbings, beatings, rapes… violent physical action, in other words. Lots of noise, screams, smoke, and fury. Writers need to think differently and understand that action in fiction means something much more than in real life.I just read a letter on another blog from a beginning writer who complained that she began her novel with “action”—in her case, an armed robbery involving her protagonist—and then couldn’t figure out why this didn’t “hook” the reader, i.e., the agent, she’d sent it to. She said he turned her mss down because while the robbery hooked him in the very beginning, it turned out to be mostly unrelated to the story that followed. This poor writer had done what a lot of writers seem to do. She thought that when teachers, agents and editors said they wanted to be “hooked” immediately on the first page, they were looking for something along the lines of that lay definition of action. A gun going off or whatever.Not.The term “action” when applied to fiction means something vastly broader and more encompassing of other activities than the stuff listed above. While it can include those kinds of activities, literary action also encompasses many other things. Dialog is action, for instance. A character driving down the road and seeing a dead plover is also action. A character reading a newspaper on the subway is action. Anything a character is doing is… action.This one misunderstood term is to blame for many of the mistakes made in creating a manuscript, especially when trying to follow the advice of the pros.I regularly get very nice letters from folks who’ve read my book on story beginnings (Hooked) who reveal, by their questions that they’ve fallen prey to that misconception of the word “action.” Statements like this are not atypical: “I know I’m supposed to start with action, but the story I want to write isn’t high-concept and is more of a character study. I can’t have my protagonist, Irma, getting raped. Nothing like that would ever happen to her. I know in your book you say the story has to open with action, but I don’t see how I can do that here. Should I write another story?”That’s a made-up statement, but it’s accurate inasfar as the gist of some of the letters I receive. And, it’s reflective of a couple of things. One, a misunderstanding of the term action, and, two; a sure sign of selective reading. That’s fairly common, I’ve found. I’m probably guilty of the same myself.To address the first, I’ve tried to make it clear in Hooked, the writer’s definition of action. I’ve given a number of examples of openings that illustrated forms of action that didn’t involve any guns, sexual attacks, bombs or any of that. For instance, one of the examples I used was of James Baldwin’s story, Sonny’s Blues, which begins with the “action” of the protagonist sitting on the subway reading a newspaper where he sees an account of his brother’s arrest. That’s “action” according to the literary definition. Another, where I described the opening of Tim Sandlin’s novel, Sorrow Floats, which begins:            My behavior slipped after Daddy died and went to San Francisco. I danced in bars. I flipped the bird in churches. Early one morning in April I drove Dothan’s new pickup truck off the Snake River dike, and when the tow truck showed up they found me squatting in a snow patch in my nightgown crying over the body of a dead plover.That’s beginning with action. The action is her crying over the dead bird. It’s not even her driving the truck off the dike. The action is simply her seeing this bird and weeping. (The other part of that is just backstory and setup). Seeing the dead bird is her inciting incident and it satisfies all the requirements of a good inciting incident and begins with action. Seeing a dead bird makes her realize what she’s been running away from and it’s from that point that the story begins.And… it’s action.I won’t go through the dozens of openings I used for illustration in Hooked, but nary a one begins with a gun going off or someone being raped or a President poised with finger on the red button. But, without exception, they all began with action. Action, according to the literary usage of the term, not the lay definition.It is so crucial to understanding how stories are written successfully to fully grasp the definition of the term “action,” yet time after time, it’s obvious by the conversation that the student is thinking of the lay definition in his or her application and thought process.To address the second point, many readers read selectively; that is, some of what they read becomes invisible to them and they \"read\" only the parts that appeal to them. I know I've defined action over and over in my books on writing, and still, I communicate with writers who say they've read the books, but still don't remember reading the parts where I showed other kinds of action. At least that's what it appears is happening. I think what happens is that sometimes some folks just don't read carefully. Wish I could say I'm not guilty of doing that, but I surely am and often. If anyone has a cure, please pass it on! What happens is that the teacher and the writing student are trying to have a dialog that’s doomed to failure simply because they’re not on the same page as far as the definitions of the terms we employ. We’re close… but close doesn’t count in writing. Our chief tools as writers are words and they need to be precise. Clear and understandable. Unfortunately, our craft terms are perhaps the worst of any craft in existence and the opposite should be true. Instead of clearly defined, they are often murky and vague.For another common example of a misconception in writing terms, let’s look at the term “problem.” A problem in lay terms can mean something like the person is being divorced. Is that a problem in “real life?” Well, usually. But, in terms of describing a protagonist’s problem for story, by itself, it doesn’t rise to the level of a story problem. It’s merely a bad situation. And, bad situations do not literature make. They can—but there has to be more to it than simply a bad situation. Any one of these things for example—a rape, a murder, a kidnapping, a divorce, a partner’s cheating, a person declaring bankruptcy, a bully giving wedgies to a skinny kid—any of those instances are great examples of “problems” in real life, but without more they aren’t in literature. They’re simply… bad situations. Good for anecdotes, but not yet for stories.For something to be a problem in literary terms it has to represent a profound change in the protagonist’s life—signaling a change in the person’s life before the problem to what it is after the problem makes its appearance. It has to rise to the level that nothing can interfere with his or her struggle to resolve the problem until it’s finally resolved. If, for instance, the character can take time off for other things even briefly—then it hasn’t yet achieved the status of story problem. This is what happens often when writers believe their character’s inciting incident began in childhood (the inciting incident being the event that created and/or revealed the problem) and then they have the kid “take off” the next seven years so they can get old enough to tackle the problem. Might work in real life, but it’s just not a problem yet in story terms. It’s a… bad situation. If anything can get in the way of, distract, or cause it to be put on the shelf for any period of time whatsoever… it’s just not a problem in literary terms.Also, the story problem has to have two levels. The initial problem is what I’ve created the term “surface problem” for. That’s what seems to be the problem at the onset of the story. Surface problems can be anything. But, they all have to be symptomatic of a deeper, more personal, psychological problem, to which I’ve created the term “story-worthy problem.” The surface problem is simply kind of the “material” manifestation of the story-worthy problem.For example, in the movie Indiana Jones, Indiana’s surface problem is to win his father’s respect. To do this, he feels he has to find the Holy Grail. His surface goal which he feels will resolve his surface problem. But, his story-worthy problem is his lack of self-respect. In a story, the protagonist has to go through the struggle to resolve the surface problem to finally realize (as a result of the struggle) what his true (story-worthy) problem is.In the movie, Thelma & Louise, protagonist Thelma’s surface problem is to escape her overbearing husband briefly. Her story-worthy problem—which she can only discover after going through her struggle—is to escape a male-dominated world in which she has little voice.In David Madden’s novel, The Suicide’s Wife, the protagonist’s problem is that her husband has (supposedly) committed suicide and left her unprepared to face life’s everyday demands. Her surface goal to resolve this is to obtain her driver’s license. Her real story-worthy problem is to find out if she has the internal wherewithal to exist independently. The struggle she undergoes to resolve her story problem leads her to understand what that problem is symptomatic of and therefore gives her the capability to resolve the deeper problem.In almost all instances, both the surface problem and the story-worthy problem are resolved in the last and final scene. When s(he) resolves the other one, at that point s(he) understands the underlying problem at the same time and by his or her choice in that final scene also resolves that problem as well.The point I’m trying to make here is that when we use the term “problem” in writing and story terms, we’re not talking about real-life problems. There has to be more involved to make it rise to the level of a good story problem than just a bad situation. Problem as applied to story is something far more than a problem in real life.There are many such terms we use as writing teachers that we’ve borrowed from the lay language, and because students and beginning writers very often ascribe those lay definitions to the terms, we have a problem communicating with each other and fully understanding and grasping the advice given We’re close… but close just ain’t good enough.I’ve often thought that there is a great need for a text on this. It’s presumptuous, I suppose, for one person to think he or she can create a lexicon that all writers should follow, but somebody needs to do this. Right? Okay. I’m on it…Anyway, I hope this helps a bit to “unmuddy” the waters…Blue skies,Les"},

This is a Christian novel, but the same basics are important as in any other genre. At her request, I’ve also changed the names of the four characters in the Japanese concentration camp, as this novel is based on a real-life story and she needs to get permissions to use their names before the novel is published.If those of you who know me wonder how in the heck a reprobate like me can work with a Christian writer, all I can say is that the word on the street is: God works in mysterious ways…Boy, does He ever!Also—I feel confident that when she’s finished, this is going to be a publishable novel. She’s a terrific writer and has a compelling story.I ask all of my students to provide a 15-20 word outline for their novel, which will be the first item. This outline isn’t like Comp I outlines, which list topic sentences. Instead, the statements indicate the results of actions taken to resolve the story problem. How they get to those results is up to them. It’s not intended to necessarily be clear to an uninformed reader, but simply shows the main plot points and how they ended up and is intended solely to keep the writer on track and focused. She’s the only one (well, besides me) who has to understand what the statements represent.As with my other client that I recently used in a posting, I’m going to give this author the same pseudonym of “Susan.” Once she sells her book and it comes out, I’ll reveal who she is. Count on it!With the editing as indicated, this is what she sent in this week and my comments:INCITING INCIDENT:Miyako learns brother’s killer will be in OsakaDEVELOPMENT:Miyako plots to assassinate killerMiyako failsMiyako joins Christian seekers groupMiyako attempts to assassinate killer, stabs brother insteadRESOLUTION:Miyako receives brother’s forgiveness, converts to Christianity, is arrested (I always ask my clients and students to have an ending that reflects both a win and a loss.)*(What follows is from later on in the novel. We’ve been introduced to Miyako and her story problem is clearly on the page. This is perhaps twenty pages or so into the novel and is in her target’s pov. She’s employing multiple povs. This is also a bit later on in his chapter and we’ve already been introduced to his character. He’s on the bridge of a ship, on his way to Japan to begin a speaking tour.A dash of cold spray across his sleeve brought him back to the present. He blotted it on his jacket, then turned and paced along the railing. How ironic. Forty months in prison, and he spent every moment desperate for a way to escape the Japanese. Now that he had his freedom, he was heading back by choice. And he couldn’t wait to reach Japan.He tried again to pray, but encountered opposition. A thought echoed from a darker corner of his mind. It was almost like a voice, challenging him. Why are you so eager to come back here? Don’t you remember what they did to you last time? Don’t you remember how they treated you and your fellow POWs? How they executed Smith and Quince and Nance? How they starved Nix to death?Remember how it felt to waste away from malnutrition? How it felt to watch your buddies starve? How it felt to have nothing to look forward to but hunger, beatings, and an early grave? Why are you coming back to the people who did that to you? Bill stopped pacing. He stared straight forward, his hands balled into fists in his pockets.The Japanese are not open to you. They’re not open to your God. They’re not interested in His message of love and forgiveness. You’re wasting your time. So why put yourself at risk again? Especially now that you have a wife and son. Don’t you owe them something? Just leave the Japanese alone. Let them sit on their little islands and pay for what they’ve done.But the last bit was a mistake. One goal had kept him sane during those last months of imprisonment. Had kept him grounded through his sudden release and heady first weeks of freedom. Had driven him to finish Bible college in record time.Unlikely as it seemed, he was sure Jesus had appointed him to take His vital message of forgiveness to the Japanese. If millions of Japanese people were going to die in their sins, it would not be because Bill had failed to bring them the message.“Get thee behind me, Satan!” he shouted into the wind.This won him a brief respite. But the inner voice tried a new tack. How do you know Jesus has called you back to Japan? What if He didn’t? What if it’s just your own idea? Your ego talking?He mentally retraced the steps that had brought him here.Susan, you might want to reconsider casting the above in a scene rather than in Bill’s mind. Perhaps an exchange between him and his wife for at least part of it. Characters ruminating over past events (backstory) often are deadly dull for the reader. We really want to see people interacting. An interior monologue is mostly passive. Conversation can be as well, but it’s at least a small cut above a character’s thoughts, especially extended thoughts such as these. Also, such a conversation shouldn’t be just an info dump, but the two characters should be somewhat at odds and whenever possible, have their dialog written as off-the-nose more than a Q&A type of exchange.The fork in his road came during his third winter in prison. He was in solitary somewhere near Nanking. By then the five surviving airmen looked more like skeletons than men, but Larry Nix was in the worst shape. For weeks he had been growing weaker, to the point where he could no longer exercise at all during their fifteen minutes outside each day. He would just sit on a bench and watch the rest of them. They were all concerned about Larry, but none of them were prepared for what happened.Bill was in his cell on a winter morning when an unusual racket started in the yard. The single, small window at the top of the wall was designed to let a beam of light in, not to permit prisoners to see out. But he had learned that if he braced his feet on the side walls of the narrow cell, he could scale up them until he could just manage to look out. It took some effort, and he had to be careful that the guards did not catch him at this trick or there would be a beating. But curiosity overcame caution this morning, and he made his way up the walls. He discovered that the source of the noise was a project the guards were busy with. They were hammering away at a large box. This was something new. His imagination ran everywhere as he tried to work out what it could be. The next morning, he found out. A guard opened his cell door and brought him outside. In the middle of the yard, resting on bare earth, he saw the box—with Larry’s emaciated frame arranged in it. He stared down at what was left of the young officer. He had admired him. Larry was a prince of a fellow—perhaps the best of them all. A hero who nearly drowned trying to save a fellow crew member after his plane went down off the coast of China. A man of faith who continued to believe they would all pull through somehow, even after the rest of them had lost hope. A thinker who was first to see the signs they were losing mental acuity in solitary. Larry had challenged each of them to come up with intellectual exercises to keep their minds fresh. He had passed his own time composing philosophical essays.This last paragraph is mostly telling. I’d consider a brief scene here dramatizing this, showing Larry and the others talking and Larry doing what you summarized—urging them to come up with the exercises. Even a paragraph or two delivering this bit with a scene raises the interest level and dramatic level. One of the guys groaning and refusing to do so—the others seeing his wisdom, etc. That kind of thing.And here he was, cold and still, laid out in a makeshift coffin. All his philosophies dead with him.I could be next, Bill thought. Any one of us could be next. They could kill us all off here, one by one, and no one back home would even know. He felt exhausted. Numb.You might want to break this up with Miyako in a scene. You’re following a passive block with Bill’s thoughts with another passive block when he’s basically summarizing his experience in the prison camp. It’s primarily backstory and told via exposition, rather than dramatized. It might be too much if both of these sections are together, back-to-back. Make sense?   CHAPTER 3It was well after closing. The restaurant was deserted. Miyako sat across from an old family friend, Mr. Mitsumi, at one of the tables.See how—automatically—the reader’s ears perk up? We’re in a scene now and the interest level automatically raises with scenes. Scenes deliver emotion while exposition/summary doesn’t.He sucked his breath in sharply, surprised. After a moment, he let it out and looked her in the eyes.“So, Miyako-chan. You want to poison someone.” He chuckled. “Well, I’ve known you since you were very small, and I didn’t think you’d come looking for me at this time of night to trade small talk.”She hadn’t decided how much to tell him. She took a drag on her cigarette and studied the ash tray as she snuffed it out. “Can I assume it’s a matter of kao?” he said.When she lifted her eyes to meet his, they burned with intensity.If you’re referring to Miyako’s eyes here, you’ve just left her pov. She can’t see herself to know her eyes are “burning with intensity.” “Hai, Mitsumi-san.”“Then, since I have such a long association with your family, I must give you what little help I can. But I am afraid it will not be as much as you hope for.” Susan, as always, this works very well. The main thing I’d caution you is to try to avoid too much of a character’s wandering about and ruminating in his head. A bit is fine, but try to find ways to dramatize these kinds of things. Same thing with flashbacks. Create scenes for those rather than “I remember when…” kinds of things, where it’s delivered totally via summary/exposition. As a small example, when he’s remembering Larry, which works better—what you have in summary--or perhaps something like this:He had admired him. Larry was a prince of a fellow—perhaps the best of them all. A hero who nearly drowned trying to save a fellow crew member after his plane went down off the coast of China. A man of faith who continued to believe they would all pull through somehow, even after the rest of them had lost hope. A thinker who was first to see the signs they were losing mental acuity in solitary.            “Men,” Bill remembered Larry saying one day during the exercise period. “We’re vegetating. The Japanese are winning our minds and we’re not doing anything to fight them.”            They were walking clockwise around the compound in a loose group. Their usual exercise regimen. Walking was about all they were capable at this point and it was almost more than at least a couple of them could manage. Bill could see the Japanese guards sitting on the porch watching them. One—a kid who didn’t look any more than fifteen—turned to the older guard beside him and said something and the older man laughed.            “It’s kind of hard to fight anything when you can barely walk,” Quince said. “Christ, Lieutenant, get real.” As if to punctuate his argument, Quince halted and lapsed into a fit of intense coughing. Bill limped up to him and tried patting him on the back. It seemed to help. He straightened up, eyes rheumy, and nodded his thanks. They began walking again.            “I know what you’re saying,” Larry said, “but we can do things. Like…” he paused, his brow knit in thought, “…we can do mental exercises. Keep our minds sharp.”            “Like what?” Nance said. He was the camp wiseacre. “Tell each other riddles? Here’s one. What’s black and white and read all over?” He began to cackle.            “I know, I know,” Larry said. “It sounds foolish, but I think we need to try it.” His voice raised in excitement. “I know! There are things we all know that others don’t. For instance, I’ve always wondered what Occam’s Razor was all about. I’ve heard it all my life, but don’t have a clue what it is. I bet somebody here does. That’s the kind of thing we can do. Bring up stuff like this, figure it out. It’ll keep our minds sharp.” At the end of his speech, he seemed to be almost begging for the others to consider his proposal.            “Well…” Joe Smith said. “I had a semester in college. Took a class in philosophy. Occam’s Razor means…”            Thus it happened that Larry had challenged each of them to come up with intellectual exercises to keep their minds fresh. He had passed his own time composing philosophical essays. His first one, Bill remembered, was on Occam’s Razor.And yet, there he was, cold and still, laid out in a makeshift coffin. All his philosophies dead with him.I could be next, Bill thought. Any one of us could be next. They could kill us all off here, one by one, and no one back home would even know.This is just a quick example, Susan, but do you see how dramatizing things like this instead of summarizing them can ratchet up the scene? It’s just good strategy to look for ways to get the material across dramatically (which means via scenes) rather than with exposition/summary. Hope this helps!Blue skies,LesAnd here’s how “Susan” ended up creating the flashback with her own originality:He had admired him. Larry was a prince of a fellow—perhaps the best of them all. A hero who nearly drowned trying to save a fellow crew member after his plane went down off the coast of China. A man of faith who continued to believe they would all pull through somehow, even after the rest of them had lost hope. A thinker who was first to see the signs they were losing mental capacity in solitary. He remembered how he caught up with Larry during their exercise period one afternoon. “Damn it, Smith’s at it again,” he whispered. “Oh, Lord, sure enough,” Larry said. Smith was standing in a corner of the yard—by himself—yelling incoherently.“Poor fellow. I guess he’s had all he can take.”“Yeah. And that’s where we’re all headed.” Larry looked around to see whether their conversation was drawing attention. He kept his voice to a whisper. “You know, I’ve been thinking about this. We’re all getting a little crazy, and I don’t think it’s just the vitamin deficiency. I think the strain of all the time spent alone is getting to us. You know what worries me most?”“What?”“What if, when we finally get out of here, they have to put us all in the psych ward because we’re mentally gone?” He glanced over at Smith. He had lapsed into silence now and was fingering the bricks in the wall.“Yeah, that would be God-awful.” “We’ve got to come up with ways to keep our minds sharp.” Larry thought a minute. “Look, how many Presidents’ names did you learn in school?” “What?”More slowly. “How many Presidents’ names did you learn in school?”“Well.... 32, of course.”“How many can you remember now?”“Roosevelt, Hoover, Coolidge… Washington, Lincoln, Jefferson… Adams… hmm… Grant… umm…”“See what I mean?” “Geez, yeah.”Larry put a hand on his shoulder. “Look, when you’re back in your cell, remember as many as you can, and tell me tomorrow how many you get. Also, you need to come up with some other pursuit to engage your mind. Something you care about.” “Like what?”“Well…. I’ve started an essay on philosophy. I’m committing it to memory.”“Oh, I see.… Maybe I’ll try a poem.”Larry clapped him on the shoulder. “That’s the ticket. You can recite it to me tomorrow.” Larry had challenged each of them to find ways to keep their minds fresh. He had gone on to compose several essays on philosophical problems himself, entirely in his head. But here he was, cold and still, laid out in a makeshift coffin. All his philosophies dead with him.I could be next, Bill thought. Any one of us could be next. They could kill us all off here, one by one, and no one back home would even know. He felt exhausted. Numb.See how Susan appropriated this and made it hers? This is why she’s progressing leaps and bounds as a writer and why she’s creating a novel folks are going to want to read.Hope this gives the writers out there a little useful info. Avoid that deadly-dull exposition/summary in flashbacks as much as possible! Your story will gain untold energy by doing so. One of the keys in creating good fiction is to avoid stalls where the reader’s interest flags and give him or her an excuse to put down the story. Sometimes… never to return. Sometimes those parts are inevitable, but the writer should do his or her very best to avoid them. Backstory and flashbacks are particularly deadly and the best way to avoid slowing down or dulling the read is to capture the flashback/backstory portion in scenes rather than exposition/summary. To write like Harry Crews, who says he “tries to leave out the parts readers skip.” It’s easy to skip summary for the reader. It’s much more difficult to skip a scene! We’re all voyeurs at heart. We love to eavesdrop on people interacting. Most of us aren’t interested in someone’s relatively boring ruminations…Blue skies,LesP.S. I'm in heaven. It's football season and (right now, anyway) my Irish are beating Purdue! Next week my Colts start their trek toward the Super Bowl. And yes, they're \"my\" teams!"},
{"title": "INTERVIEW WITH KARI WOLFE", "date": "Thursday, August 26, 2010", "text": "Hi folks,Kari Wolfe interviewed me back in April for her blog and has reposted it today. I thought I'd posted it here as well, but in searching don't think that I did. So... thought you might be interested in it. Interview with LES EDGERTON of “Hooked” and “Finding Your Voice”    April 7th, 2010 | Author: Kari Wolfe             Les EdgertonToday’s interview is with Les Edgerton, the author of Hooked: Write Fiction That Grabs Readers at Page One & Never Lets Them Go and Finding Your Voice: How to Put Personality in Your Writing as well as several other nonfiction and fiction titles.Les’s background is a colorful one–the Navy, a stint in prison for  burglary, past Writer-in-Residence at two universities, and presently he  teaches writers’ workshops for Writer’s Digest.  I still stop at the  “stint in prison” bit for a moment.  Not because I think badly of  him–far from it!–but because he learned from his mistakes and moved on.   It’s that “moving on” part that I think is highly admirable.He is working on his memoir, tentatively titled “Adrenaline Junkie.”Both of Les’s writing books are on my writing desk for future reference.-00-From rock-bottom in prison to published writer and college  instructor… that’s quite an amazing work.  Can you give me (and my  readers) an idea of how bad it got and then how you picked yourself up  and decided to change your life?  Well, prison’s pretty bad, all right! Nothing fun about it  that I can remember. I came from a dysfunctional childhood (who hasn’t,  right?), and went into the Navy for four years. When I was discharged, I  came back to Indiana (from Bermuda and San Salvador in the Bahamas) and  was bored out of my skull. I got into crime for one reason—it was  exciting. Didn’t need the money or anything like that. It just fed my  adrenaline jones. Prison woke me up. It wasn’t a place I ever wanted to  go back to. Fortunately, I met a woman who helped change my life, my  third wife Sheila. With her encouragement, I began college. It was a bit  tough. Shortly after I began, she became pregnant with our first  daughter, Britney, and I was the sole breadwinner. I went to college  full-time, worked full-time (cut hair—I’d gone to barber school in the  joint), and also held down a part-time job as a sports reporter  (weekends) for The South Bend Tribune. I was also involved in  campus activities, being elected, in successive years as student body  senator, vice-president, and in my senior year, student body president. I  was also the sports editor of the campus newspaper. Was involved in SDS  (Students for a Democratic Society) and College Republicans. That ‘s a  bit incongruous, but I didn’t join either of them for political reasons,  but mostly for the girls. (I hadn’t quit being a bad boy entirely—was  doing a ton of womanizing. Also, gambling.) Got about four hours sleep a  night. I hear this lame ad on the radio about this girl going on about  her “heavy” school schedule where she names her classes and how she has  go trek across campus to each one and at the end, thanks the people who  paid her way. Must be nice! I had to pay my own way, plus work full  time, plus support a family, and do those other things. Her deal sounds  kind of cushy, to be honest. She doesn’t even have to work a part-time  job! And, I ended up with a 3.64 GPA and graduated with Honors of  Distinction. I’m kind of proud of doing that after being in prison just  months before I began. I still had my adrenaline jones, but was doing  things society approved of instead.I’ve always been a writer and always saw that as my life’s  work, from the age of five, so I was writing also. While in school, I  finished my first novel and eventually had it published (The Death of Tarpons,  University of North Texas Press). I just wrote in my “spare” time. The  fact that I got published made me feel validated as a writer, so I  applied to and got accepted into the MFA in Writing program at Vermont  College.-00-Your book, “Hooked: Write Fiction That Grabs Readers at Page One and Never Lets Them Go,”  is a great source for writers who aren’t sure where to start their  story or who have had feedback from either editors or other readers that  their story is hard to “get involved in.”  What is your favorite  beginning line from any book and how important is that first line to the  reader, really?Extremely  important. As is the second line. And the third. And so on. But, it’s  the first line that the agent and editor and eventually, the reader  read. It better be good enough that they’ll want to read the next line.  Here’s what people sometimes don’t understand. When you’re beginning and  aren’t yet published, you’re really writing for one person only. An  agent. Not even an editor at this point. If you’re sending to editors  who accept unagented submissions, they’re most likely not at the kind of  publishing house that’s going to give you much of a career if they take  your stuff. You really need an agent. And, if you understand how agents  work, you’ll see how important that first line is. Agents get queries  and manuscripts sent to them by the ton. They know that the vast  majority of what is sent to them isn’t publishable. They also know that  somewhere in that vast pile on their desk (and on the floor, and in the  room down the hall, and coming at them daily in the mail and over the  internet) might be a book they can actually get published and make some  money from. If they actually read every manuscript that came their way  (or even the first 5-10 pages), they’d never get anything done. In  self-defense, they read about the first few paragraphs. There might be a  brilliant book that starts on page ten or page two, but they’ll usually  never get that far if the first line—the first paragraph or two at  most—doesn’t grab them. So, yes, it’s very important. Writers may not  like this, and think it’s unfair, but fair or not, it’s the way it is.I recently met a young man at Bouchercon who had his first  book taken by an uber-agent a few hours before we met (he was on Cloud  Nine), and he told me how he’d snagged this agent. He wrote his book for her.  He read every single book she’d represented and figured out what she  liked. He didn’t think for a second about other readers—only her. And  she jumped on it. It began exactly the way she liked and it was a novel  written with everything he’d figured out she liked, from reading the  books she repped, paying attention to her blog and website, etc. I don’t  recommend this for everyone, but it worked for this guy. The thing  is—and what he realized—is that you don’t have to get yeses from dozens  of people. You only need one yes. And, if that person is well-respected  in the literary community, they’ll buy the book on her recommendation.  This isn’t information you’ll probably get from the average workshop,  believe me.People often wonder how a book they think is bad gets  published. Many times, it’s published because it got a yes from the  right person—a gatekeeper such as a top agent. It may have been rejected  by 100 others. Doesn’t matter. All it takes is one yes. Hopefully, by  the right person.There’s a myth going around that began with screenplays. That  if the work is good enough, eventually someone will buy it. The same  myth goes around nowadays with novel manuscripts. The truth is, there  are literally thousands of good, solid, even brilliant books… that will  never get published. The “good stuff” didn’t begin until page seven.  It’s too late for that book. It better be good on page one. It better be  good with paragraph one. It better be good with sentence one.To all this, I know someone is going to say, “But, wait. What  about (name a book on the shelves).?” Well, first ask yourself if the  book you’re thinking of isn’t by a brand name? If so, then  all the  “rules” are off. A person who already has books in print and an audience  in place doesn’t have to play by the same rules as the rest of us.  Stephen King and Joyce Carol Oates can send in their grocery lists and  probably get them published. I don’t think the rest of us can…My own favorite beginning line is from one of my own short  stories. “The Bad Part of Town” included in my short story collection, Monday’s Meal. It begins: He was so mean that wherever he was standing became the bad part of town.  A person reviewing this book on Amazon, hated it, but I could care  less. He wasn’t a real reviewer to begin with—just some guy with a  computer, which is mostly what Amazon reviewers are. Another favorite  is: Tucker Case awoke to find himself hanging from a breadfruit tree by a coconut fiber rope. That’s from one of my favorite writers, Christopher Moore in his hysterically funny black comedy novel, Island of the Sequined Love Nun. Another is from suspense master Linwood Barclay in his can’t-put-it-down novel, Fear the Worst, which begins: The morning of the day I lost her, my daughter asked me to scramble her some eggs.-00-In “Finding Your Voice: How to Put Personality in Your WritingFinding Your Voice: How to Put Personality in Your Writing,”  you talk about how the rules of grammar and the styles of your favorite  authors may be stifling the author’s own unique voice.  Isn’t it good  sometimes to imitate your favorite author or to take bits and pieces of  his/her style and incorporate them in to your own?I would without qualification say a very loud, NO! I  wouldn’t copy anyone’s style. We already have a Hemingway. Nobody needs  or wants a second-rate or derived Hemingway. Now, I do advise stealing  techniques. If someone writes something that affects you emotionally,  study how he or she did it and employ the same technique. When I’m  writing a novel, I usually have open about thirty other novels and go to  them often to see how they did something I’m trying to do in my own. I  look at Elmore Leonard, for instance, to see how he writes dialog. He’s  one of the best. I don’t copy his dialog—I see how he achieves the  effect he does and I use the same technique myself. Like someone said a  long time ago, “Bad writers borrow; good writers steal.”Writing is kind of like music. Who do you think is going to  make it big? The garage band that plays all the Rolling Stones songs to  perfection? Or the garage band that writes their own, original music and  plays like no other band? The Rolling Stone cover band is only ever  going to play at Holiday Inns. The original music band may not make it,  but they have a much better chance than the one who imitates another.-00-Agent  Stephen Barbara, Gail Provost, Les Edgerton and Roman White. Taken at  last summer's Writer's Retreat Workshop in Erlanger, KY.In great novels, the author’s voice blends into the story and, well,  kinda disappears because you have the action going on in your head.  Ultimately, how do you separate point of view and voice?  If I have an  “over-the-shoulder” 3rd person narrator, should that be written in the  character’s voice or the author’s?Good question, Kari. The answer is, the character should be  written in the character’s voice. As a college teacher, at the beginning  of each semester, I always get a young man or woman who wants me to  read their opus. So many times, I get a mss that’s 400 pages of mostly  the character’s thoughts. Joe Blow wrote it via a character he’s named  Blow Joe, who is really the author, regurgitating his thoughts via this  character, almost always some kind of polemic about some political  system he’s just discovered and is nuts about. The reason they coined  the term “sophomoric.” No market for that kind of drivel.But… that character’s voice is also the writer’s. As Walt  Whitman said, “We contain multitudes.” And we do. The example I use in Finding Your Voice  is that of a person who feels comfortable both in a biker bar and at  the governor’s ball. If he’s sitting with a rappy at the biker bar and  someone comes in and his rappy introduces him, he might reply, “Whas’  up, bro?” The same guy, at the receiving line at the governor’s mansion,  meeting the governor and his wife, would probably say, “How do you do,  Governor and Mrs. Brown. I’m very pleased to meet you.” Same guy,  different voice for the occasion. We do the same thing with our  characters.Also, you said “the author’s voice blends into the story” and  that’s as it should be. We shouldn’t be aware someone is writing the  story. When we do, that’s not the writer’s natural voice. It’s an  affected voice, a “writerly” voice. The voice should be invisible and  not get in the way of the story. This, I think, is why we get so many  writers who probably shouldn’t be writing. They read a story, written in  clear English, and think, “This is easy! I could write a story.” What  they don’t realize is that to achieve that kind of voice takes many,  many rewrites. They think: I can read, therefore I can write. It’s like  if I saw a brain operation on TV, it looks easy, and I think: I can do  that. I just hope that person performs his first operation on someone  else…As far as third, first, or second person, there’s no difference. Each should sound like the character.-00-Do you have a particular place and time (of day as well as length)  where you write in your house?   Do you warm-up by journaling, using  writing exercises, reading email/news?These days I have my own room. It’s a mess! Books and papers  everywhere. As far as a particular time of day, yes. I write all day  long. I get up at five, do my bathroom thing (while reading), and go to  my desk at 5:45. I sit there all day, writing. I don’t eat breakfast or  lunch (wastes time), and I only stop to go to the bathroom. My wife gets  off work about 7 or 8, and she passes by and says hi. Half an hour  later, we eat, and I read while I’m eating. Then, I go back to my room  and write until about 10 and then go to bed, and read for half an hour,  turn on the TV, and fall asleep half an hour later. I do this seven days  a week. Occasionally, we’ll have to go to a wedding or funeral or  something, and I really resent the time away from my work. If my mother  died—and I love my mother—as soon as the funeral was over, I’d be back  at my desk, writing. I haven’t taken a vacation in 25 years and don’t  want one. I’m obsessed. I don’t recommend my writing style to others,  but it’s what I do. One of the reasons I don’t recommend it to others is  that I don’t want the competition. Please—write an hour a day! That  will make it much easier for me to get my stuff published…Actually, I didn’t always write this way. Years ago, I wrote  when “the muse descended” whatever that means. When I was in “the mood.”  But… I wasn’t getting much published. I was just about ready to quit  and do something truly mind-numbing like sell insurance, when a good  friend gave me the same advice everyone else had which I’d ignored.  However, she said it at the right time. She knew I was ready to quit and  she knew I didn’t really want to. What she said was the same as  everyone always ways, “Write every day.” Only she said it a bit  differently. She said, “Do yourself a favor. Write every day for a week. That’s all. Just one week. But, write every single day, no matter what.”  She told me it was like jogging. She said if a person jogged every day  for a week and then missed a day, it was like they’d missed a meal. They  couldn’t go a day without jogging if they only did it for a week. I was  desperate, so I did it. That was twenty some years ago and she was  right. I can’t not write every day. I’m not a jogger, but she was right.  If you write every day for a week, you can’t not write on the eighth  day. At least I couldn’t.-00-I really am the queen of procrastination.  I’m trying my damnedest to  overcome it, but it just happens sometimes.  Do you ever  procrastinate?  If you do, how do you overcome it?I guess I could, but I don’t. It’s like that so-called  “writer’s block.” I don’t believe in such a thing at all. Writing’s a  job, just like any other job. You never hear of “plumber’s block” do  you? Well, there are days when the plumber doesn’t want to run that  snake down Mrs. Jones’ drainpipe, but he does it anyway. And, the  results are the same as those days when he can’t wait to get to work.Some college did a study years ago where they took of a group  of professional writers—they defined “professional writers” by those  who made their entire living from writing—and asked them to keep a  journal for a year. In the journal, they asked the writer to mark each  day’s work with whether he felt “the muse” or had to force himself to  write. They also had him or her mark which they thought was the better  work—the stuff they wrote when they couldn’t get it down fast enough or  the stuff they sat there all day struggling to turn out half a page. To a  person, the writers all felt strongly that the stuff they wrote when  they were writing as fast as they could was far better than the stuff  they struggled with. The college then asked an independent panel of  readers to read the writer’s output and judge its quality. (They didn’t  know what the writer himself had said about it.) The result? The panel  could find no difference whatsoever in the quality of the work. The work  the writer struggled with was exactly the same quality as the work he  couldn’t get down fast enough.As far as writer’s block, one of the reasons I don’t  experience any at all, is that I work on about 30 things at a time. That  includes novels, nonfiction books, articles, essays, nonfiction book  proposals, outlines for books, queries, and all kinds of stuff. If I  happen to get bored or stuck on anything, I just shut that file, open  another one and I’ve wasted no time at all. I’m always interested in  what I’m working on. To me, a person who claims “writer’s block” has  fallen victim to an excuse not to write. My wife coined the phrase I  think is apt here. Speaking of a friend of ours, she said, “Jim creates  ceilings to bump his head into.” That’s what I suspect writers who think  they have writer’s block are doing. Creating ceilings to bump their  heads into.-00-Last, but never least, what 5 items would you want to have with you in the upcoming zombie apocalypse?My I.Q. for one. That means I wouldn’t need anything else,  because who can believe in zombies to begin with? (This sounds like one  of Barbara Wa-Wa’s questions…) If I were on a desert island, however,  I’d want paper and something to write with, a never-ending supply of  Jack Daniels, a copy of the most perfect book ever written, The Stranger  by Camus—that’s three things, right?—my wife and a never-ending supply  of crawfish etoufee. Mostly, though, I’d need the paper and writing  instrument. I’d never be bored. I’d just do what I do now—write the book  I always wanted to read but no one had written, so I have to write it  myself.-00-Thanks, Kari, for this opportunity. I’ve tried to be as  honest as I can and that may rub some folks the wrong way. If so, that’s  a good thing. It’s like writing—if it pleases everybody it isn’t much  good.Blue skies,Les-00-Thank you, Les, for answering my questions!  And may you have ‘blue skies’ as well!"},
{"title": "SOME OBSERVATIONS ON SALMONELLA, GLOBAL WARMING, AND HISTORY", "date": "Monday, August 23, 2010", "text": "I want to depart for a bit here to talk about a recent story on the national news about the outbreak of salmonella where millions of eggs were recalled. A portion of a recent article on Web MD stated:Aug. 19, 2010 -- Eggs are behind a nationwide salmonella outbreak that caused hundreds of illnesses each week in June and July.The nationwide egg recall has expanded to include eggs made from five plants owned by Wright County Egg of Galt, Iowa. It now involves more than a dozen major brands that got eggs from this company. The New York Times reports that the recall now includes 380 million eggs.Eggs were traced to the company after the CDC noticed a four-fold increase in Salmonella Enteritidis isolates from people suffering food poisoning. State investigators in California, Colorado, and Minnesota found clusters of illness from this salmonella strain among people who ate eggs at the same restaurants. Those restaurants got eggs that came from Wright County Egg.Investigations continue in Arizona, Connecticut, Massachusetts, Maryland, North Carolina, Nevada, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Tennessee, and Texas. According to a CDC spokeswoman, the outbreak is \"pretty much nationwide.\"Various other news reports in the media say much the same thing. This particular outbreak is just one of several reported by Web MD in the month of August alone (which isn’t over). Here’s their list:• August 20, 2010 - Milton's Baking Voluntarily Recalls 24 oz.

I suspect that chiefly because of the age of the reporters. Perhaps they don’t know that national outbreaks of this nature are relatively recent in our history—at least as far as the quantity and frequency of them.Sometimes, there’s an advantage to being older. Along the way to waking up more mornings than many others, is that one gets to accumulate real-life knowledge along the way. Us older fogies have the advantage of learning history from living through it, rather than gaining it from books created by historians or writers who choose what to put in or to leave out. Many of us even used to read two newspapers to get a somewhat balanced view of what was really going on. Not very possible these days unless people get papers from two-newspaper towns, which today are rare, at least for medium-sized cities and smaller.What I’m referring to is that these kinds of national outbreaks aren’t new. They’re just relatively new to our country—mostly during the past two or three decades. Another nation used to have these kinds of universal outbreaks virtually every year.I’m referring to the USSR. When I was a kid, Russia was the biggest wheat-grower in the world with millions of acres in production. Yet, every year, without fail, they would turn to the United States to sell them wheat as they’d routinely lose millions and millions of bushels of their primary food crop to “outbreaks” of wheat diseases, and their citizens would have starved in large numbers had not the U.S. come to their aid.Why?Simple. Their political system. One of the basic tenets of socialism is the collective. In virtually everything, including agriculture, the individual was sacrificed on the altar of the collective. No small businesses—only one large corporation, called the “government.”In agriculture, this meant the death of the family farm. The theory was that combining family farms into a single giant farm would lead to more efficiency and therefore, high production.Unfortunately, like many such “theories” the result was somewhat different. Instead of Russian peasants working their family farms of 20, 30, 80 acres, the fences were torn down and all the acreage came under the control of the collective. Literally, millions of acres.I’ve never been there, but acquaintances of mine who’ve been to Moscow report that the collective attitude pertains to almost everything they saw. One friend, for instance, says she didn’t see many Motel 6’s or Ramada Inns, at least not the way they appear on our highways and byways. She said they had these huge hotels, with thousands and thousands of rooms. A chicken ranch she visited had more than half a million chickens laying eggs. A pig farm had hundreds of thousands of pigs, and so on. No family farms, no Mom and Pop grocery stories. Humongous supermarkets. (Not much on the shelves, but the shelves were impressive…)Kind of what’s been happening in the U.S. the past few decades. The death of the family farm.How does that lead to national outbreaks? Well, one of the results of collectives was that those natural boundaries that the family farm provided, were destroyed. Just as in Communist Russia, national companies took over family farms and combined them into giant combines. Prior to the huge national agricultural companies in the U.S., we had Farmer Jones over here with 180 acres which he sowed in corn and soybeans, and divided into plots of say 20-30 acres, fenced off from other plots. Mr. Jones had a neighbor, Farmer Smith, who decided to grow alfalfa on his 80-acre farm for his Holsteins, and his neighbor, Farmer White, who divided his 280 acres into one 20-acre plot where he grew tomatoes, and larger plots where he grew field corn to feed his 80 pigs and 500 layer chickens for eggs and his 1,000 broiler chickens for meat, and another field of sweet corn for human consumption, next to his neighbor, Farmer Brown, who put most of his acreage into wheat. And so on.That meant that when a corn plant disease struck, for instance, it only went as far as the fence around that particular field. All around that field were other crops that effectively stopped the spread of the disease. If salmonella struck Farmer White’s layer chickens, it had a natural border where it was stopped and contained. If his pigs got the swine flu or whatever they get, it pretty much was contained to his farm.Natural borders, which meant diseases were contained to a specific area.Now, instead of a farmer over here with say 10,000 chickens and the next closest chicken ranch or farm maybe a dozen miles away, you have MegaEggCorp with half a million chickens or even more. A bug hits those and a huge number of birds become infected. No natural boundaries to stop the spread. Instead of a farmer with 60 acres in wheat, now we have huge farms planting thousands and thousands of acres in wheat… surrounded by other mega-farms also planting wheat, so that as far as the eye can see is… wheat. A single plant affected by wheat rot now destroys thousands and thousands of acres.And that’s what happening in this country now. Accelerated by improved delivery systems that spread an infected product with incredible speed to the entire nation. Today, eggs. Tomorrow, wheat. The day after that…The more we see the disappearance of the family farm and ranch, the more these outbreaks are bound to occur. Bring back the family farm—get government out of the agriculture business—and they’ll largely disappear. But… that’s too close to common sense to ever happen…Having lived a life and experienced history up close and personal also leads to different conclusions about life on this planet than say would a 20-year-old dependent mostly on the “media” as it exists these days.For instance, when I was in college back in the sixties, I had a biology class with a professor who gave his class the following information. He said that the U.S. was nearing the end of a century-long period of extraordinarily good weather. He said the century we were nearing the end of was an anomaly—that such a period of good weather had never occurred historically. He also said, that good weather, along with the improvements in farming and transportation had allowed the U.S. to become the breadbasket of the world. Which, at the time, we were. We were feeding half the world, including Russia with their wheat blight failures each year.Interesting guy. He told us all this in 1968. (Remember that date.) Further, he said that by most scientists’ estimates, this period of unnaturally good weather would begin to change back to what it had been historically, sometime in the 1990’s. He said at that time, we’d begin to return to more what the weather had been like in this country for centuries before. Weather much like England’s, in which the seasons would begin to lose their distinctness and merge into one another. Winters would be milder and longer and cloudier and we’d lose the extraordinary lengthy growing seasons we had enjoyed for the past seventy years. And, that, he claimed, would lead to world-wide disasters, since the world’s populations had increased significantly during this unprecedented long growing period in the U.S. where we’d been able to feed more people than ever before in history, and when the weather returned to “normal” we were going to be looking at world-wide starvation. The mortality rates which had been drastically decreased due to being able to sustain populations would begin to go back to where they had been before the century of good weather.He didn’t say a word about “global warming” or any of that. He said we would simply return to “normal” weather—the kind of weather that had been the norm for centuries before the one we were in.Now, this guy wasn’t any Nobel-prize winning Ivy League professor. He was just an associate professor in a Midwestern state college (Indiana University). The knowledge he passed on to us wasn’t the result of his own original research. It came from common knowledge he’d gleaned from looking at the past weather patterns and being able to read the signs from history and looking at what others in his field had discovered or figured out.From what I can figure out, what’s happening to our weather is pretty much what this guy pointed out. In 1968. We’re starting to see the kind of weather England has each year. And perhaps beginning to see why England has never been the breadbasket of the world.When they first started talking about global warming, I thought instantly of this guy from back in the sixties. Most of the things they were predicting were the same things he had… only he didn’t ascribe it to any emissions or pollution or anything like that at all. Just said we were merely going to return to “normal” weather conditions that the earth had been under for centuries.Now, it seems some scientists and some media have “forgotten” that our weather patterns in the past century were abnormal. Why would they have neglected to mention that? I wonder… Perhaps we should pay attention to the first rule of homicide detectives… i.e., follow the money…Again, sometimes when one has actually lived through history one may have a different point of view from one who learned their history from a textbook written by folks who just may have an agenda and perhaps don’t want to include all sides of an issue…Just some food for thought. And, I imagine which will elicit some other opinions. This is just mine. We keep saying, “Whoever ignores history is doomed to repeat it,” but do we really pay attention to that saying or is it just something we say? Maybe another one of those bumper sticker philosophies we like to quote but don’t really pay attention to its meaning?Blue skies,Les"},

She said—absolutely, send it along.Hopefully,\rthey’ll take it or someone else will. If and when it achieves publication, it\rwill have traveled a long and twisted road to borrow from some pertinent song lyrics.Ten\ryears ago, I had a publishing contract in my grubby little hands for this same\rbook. It had a different title then. It was titled My Secret Life. The reason it was titled thusly was because at the\rtime, very few of my acquaintances knew of my checkered past the memoir covered—my\rtime as a criminal where I committed over 400 burglaries as well as\rstrong-armed and armed robberies, the years spent in prison, as well as my\rother “careers” which included working for an escort service serving older\rwealthy women as their “date,” using and dealing drugs, being involved in high\rspeed car chases with the cops (I outran them, in case you’re interested),\rshootouts, being married five times, living with one of New Orleans’ top call\rgirls and participating in “gigs” with her involving one of NOLA’s most\rprominent politicians, having that same call girl girlfriend stabbing and\ralmost killing another girlfriend, as well as shooting at me and trying to run\rover me with the car I’d bought for her, being a top hairstylist with a show on\rfashion and hair on Cox Cable in New Orleans, working for some of the top\rsalons in the country, including being the styles director at Snobs in NOLA and\rworking at many other leading salons in New Orleans and California, being\rhomeless… the list goes on. None of my friends at the time knew of any of this.\rI was teaching creative writing at some pretty good schools, including the UCLA\rWriter’s Program and being Writer-in-Residence for three years at the\rUniversity of Toledo. After my release from prison (Pendleton, in Indiana), I’d\rgone to college and obtained a B.A. from Indiana University and then my MFA in\rWriting from Vermont College. I had several books published and was considered\ra “respectable person” by everyone I knew. I figured at the time it was best to\rkeep my past hidden. I didn’t realize that my past was actually an asset and\rnot the negative I assumed it was. I just assumed that if people knew how bad\rof a citizen I’d been, I’d be unable to get a decent teaching gig or get my\rbooks published. I later found out it helped, rather than hurt.Which\ris why I’ve changed the title to Adrenaline Junkie because that's really what my life had been all about.Anyway,\rat the time, I was on a roll. I’d had three books published on the beauty\rbusiness (still selling well—every year I still get a royalty check for a\rcouple of thousand bucks for books published in the 80s), as well as my first\rnovel, The Death of Tarpons, which\rwon a Special Citation from the Violet Crown Book Awards and was nominated for\ra slew of other literary awards, and a collection of my short stories, Monday’s Meal, which was also a finalist\rfor the Violet Crown and which garnered a rave review in The NY Times, comparing me to my hero, Raymond Carver. Both had\rbeen published by the University of North Texas Press (UNT). And, I had just\rsold my third book to them. My memoir. Both UNT’s publisher, Fran Vick, and the\rManaging Editor, Charlotte Wright, had loved it and had taken it to the Board\rof Regents and gotten it okayed and a contract sent to me.This\ris when things began to get hinky.A\rcouple of weeks after I signed the contract for My Secret Life, I went out to California for pitch meetings. I was\rteaching at the time for the UCLA Writer’s Program, and one of my students,\rBarbara Bennett, was married to a top manager, Paul Bennett, and Paul had\ragreed to become my manager for the screenplays I was writing. I’d just written\rone in two days (literally) which had become a semifinalist in the Academy’s\rNichol’s Awards, and even though Paul dealt strictly at the time with\rabove-the-line talent, took me on as his first below-the-line client. We had a\rgreat meeting and during it, I passed on my good news that my memoir had just\rsold and I was in the process of working with an editor at UNT on the rewrite.Paul\rwas a former Vice-President of HBO (Paul was the guy who created the Comedy Relief specials), and had a couple of years before resigned\rand become a manager. However, he still had many contacts at HBO. That night,\rhe sat down to read a few pages of it, and, as I found out the next day, he’d\rended up staying up all night as he said he couldn’t put it down. At our\rmeeting the next day, he told me how much he loved it and he said he thought\rperhaps HBO might be interested in it and would I mind if he showed it to them.Duh…He\rgave it to the president of HBO Films, and the next day this guy (sorry, can’t\rremember his name) called Paul and said he couldn’t put it down either. If\ranyone knows anything about Hollywood they know these guys never read anything.\rFor him to do so was remarkable in itself. He told Paul that they (HBO) wanted\rit and to not even show it to anyone else. He compared it to the bestselling\rbook and subsequent movie, Permanent\rMidnight, and said, it was: Permanent\rMidnight but with balls.”Suffice\rto say, I was in Seventh Heaven!I\rwent back to Indiana and with renewed energy worked on the rewrite. Then, Fran\rVick retired as the publisher of UNT and Charlotte Wright resigned to take the\rposition of Managing Editor of the University of Iowa Press, a position she\rstill holds. I was working with an independent editor UNT had assigned to me\rfor the rewrite and things were going well until about a week after Fran and\rCharlotte had left the publisher.And\rthen… weird things began to happen. The first thing was my editor stopped\rreturning my emails and phone calls. Concerned, I began calling the new editor,\ronly to find he was always “out of the office” or would “return my calls as\rsoon as he could.” This went on for a couple of weeks and by now I was in a bit\rof a panic. Finally, I got through to him and he said he was sorry but he\rcouldn’t find a contract for my book.What\rth!?I\rhad a copy of our contract but my bookkeeping system isn’t the best—actually,\rit’s a mass of clutter—and I couldn’t find it.I\rcalled Charlotte at the University of Iowa immediately. Told her what had\rhappened and she said she’d been getting other calls from writer’s she’d signed\rand she said what had happened was the new editor wanted his “own” stable of\rwriters and was doing the same thing to everyone else. She said, yes, I did\rhave a contract—she’d signed it and so had Fran and the Board of Regents, and\rshe could get me a copy… but, did I want a publisher who didn’t want me or my\rbook to publish it? I reluctantly agreed and didn’t pursue it with UNT any\rlonger.My\rthought at the time was to hell with them—I’d just find another publisher. But,\ras so often happens, life and circumstances interfered. I got caught up in\rother projects and the mss languished in a drawer and eventually I forgot about\rit. I got a new agent and told him about it and he suggested we sell one of my\rnovels first and then we’d offer it to whoever took the novel. Sounded good, I\rsaid, and that’s when the slide into hell really took off.The\rnovel he was sending out, ended up in an auction, and it got down to between\rSt. Martin’s and Random House. St. Martin’s final offer was $50,000 and Random\rHouse’s was for $45,000. My agent said it was up to me which to take and I\rdecided to take the lower offer from Random. Biggest mistake of my life! I won’t\rgo into it here (a later post, perhaps), but I was in Seventh Heaven,\respecially since they were going to bring it out simultaneously in paper from\rBallantine Books and in hardcover from Random House. I was told it would be an\rinstant bestseller because of the number of copies they were publishing.Then,\ra week after I signed the contract, Random House was taken over by Bertelsmann\rand several other things happened, and they dropped the novel. I won’t go into\rall that in this post, but may in a later one. Briefly, it severely affected my\rlife—financial and otherwise—and I’m still trying to recover from all that\rtranspired from that fiasco.But,\rmy memoir really got buried then! It languished in a drawer until about a year\rand a half ago, when I decided to work on it again. I rewrote it extensively\rand when I was taken on by Chip, we decided it was time to send it out and that\rjust happened yesterday.Anyway,\rthat’s part of the torturous trail this book has traveled! Keep your fingers\rcrossed for me—I’d really appreciate it!I\rjust thought this might be instructive to other writers. As they say in\rHollywood, don’t celebrate until the check clears!I’ve\rhad my share of setbacks in my writing career, but I’ll always maintain the\rsame philosophy, through good and bad. Just keep writing. The writing is what\rit’s all about, anyway. The journey’s where the real fun is and everything else\ris just what happens in life. There are no guarantees and no one is entitled to\ran easy life. If we don’t have some rough patches, how can we expect to\rappreciate the good times?

There had been a riot two\rdays before our bunch got there and the inmates had burned everything\rcombustible, including the mattresses. The pillows, too, were gone. They did\rgive us a thin Army-blanket that you had to lay over you in a diamond shape if\ryou were taller than five-ten. I beat that by two and a half inches.            When I woke the next morning, there\rwas a dusting of snow on my blanket, down at my feet where the blanket had\rslipped off. My toes were white. Well, the tops were white. Underneath the\rsnow, they were blue. The rioters had busted out the windows as well.\rQuarantine was in the only cellhouse that had windows to the outside. This was\ron the thirteenth of February and it also happened to be my birthday. Didn't\rlook like there was going to be any cake or presents.            The Superintendent announced to the\rinmates, “You people busted up everything and now you have to live in it. I’m\rnot giving you anything and I’m not fixing the windows, etc.”            He didn’t either. It was one cold\rspring. A shitload of guys came down with pneumonia and worse. I don’t know\rwhether anybody died. There were rumors that some did, but then we didn’t\rexactly have the N.Y. Times to check\rto see what was really going on. In movies, somebody farts in prison and in six\rminutes the entire population has the details. In Pendleton, you could have a\rguy get exed three cells from you and you might not ever know about it for a\rmonth.            Pendleton, at that time, was one of\rthe baddest joints in the country. During the years I spent there,\rthen-President Johnson had commissioned a study on penal institutions. One day,\ra bunch of us were sitting around watching the only TV in the cellhouse (black\rand white) on a rec night when Johnson came on to report their findings. He\rsaid the study had shown that Pendleton was \"categorically, the single\rworst prison in the U.S.\" We all stood up\rand cheered like he was talking about our football team and we'd just won the\rRose Bowl or something.            It was bad. During my stay, I lived through eight riots, not counting\rthe one that had just ended when I arrived, but for which I paid for with snow\ron my toes and a few other discomforts.            I'd seen a lot of things before\rthis, but there are things that happened in Pendleton that I'll never be able\rto talk about. There were some good things too. I made friendships that were\rstronger than any I've ever had before or since.            My first week out of Quarantine was\rmy first taste of what prison was like. The guy in the cell next to me, a black\rguy, had been slowwalking a debt of a carton of Camels to this guy. That night,\rthe guy who was owed the cigarettes walked by his cell and threw a beaker of\racid in the black guy's face. He'd gotten the acid from some inmate who worked\rin I.D. (Identification Department). That was where they printed and\rphotographed all new inmates. It was some kind of acid they used to develop\rpictures.            My next-door neighbor lay in his\rcell and screamed all night. We were on the second tier and just below us I\rcould see the hack at his desk. He never moved or even looked up all night.\rJust kept sitting there, reading his comic book or whatever. Toward morning,\rthe only sounds coming from my neighbor's cell was little tiny whimpers. When\rthey let us out for breakfast they must have come and dragged his ass out,\rbecause he was gone when we came back to get ready for work.            A few weeks later, the black guy\rcame back from the hospital. Obviously, he hadn't died. He might have wished he\rhad. Half the skin on his face was turned a permanent blotchy pink, the color\rof bubblegum. He'd lost one eye completely and most of the sight in the other.            You could get just about anything in\rthe joint you wanted except a girl. That was at a time when they hadn't yet\rgone to female hacks, so it may be different these days. Although there were\rguys in there you'd swear were girls and after you'd been in awhile, that's the\rway you saw them. They went by women's names and you thought of and referred to\rthem as \"her\" or \"she.\" Any drug you wanted, long as you\rhad money, you could score. Drugs were everywhere. And we ran (shot up) everything. I even knew guys who'd run\raspirin and claimed you actually got a high from it.            One night, a couple of buddies told\rme they'd scored some embalming fluid. They swore it was the best high you\rcould get. I figure they got it from some inmate who worked on the burial\rdetail. If you died and nobody claimed your body, they had a little cemetery\rjust outside the walls for your final resting place.            I was all set to shoot up with them,\rbut we had a shakedown at my cellhouse when we were coming in from work and all\rof J Block was shut down until morning. These two guys from H got out to the\rgym, where they ran the shit. Killed both of them. That was one time I was\rhappy to have been in a cellhouse shutdown."},

Thanks a bunch, Lia! This looks like a great crowd you’ve gathered here.I’d like to talk about novel endings and what makes a compelling finale to your novel. There’s no way I can cover everything that goes into a great ending, but I’ll try to cover some of the more important elements.Before we get to the ending, we need to discuss what leads up to that point. Let’s look at basic story structure. Simplified, a novel structurally consists of a protagonist and an antagonist as the two most important characters. The protagonist has something happen to him or her (inciting incident) that creates a surface problem (that’s actually symptomatic of a story-worthy problem) which will occupy him or her for the rest of the novel, trying to resolve it. The antagonist also has a goal and it’s his or her goal that provides the opposition for the protagonist in resolving his or her goal. The struggle to resolve the problem(s) against increasing opposition occupies the majority of the novel.It might be helpful to define our terms before we begin.Protagonist: Simply the individual through whose persona we (readers) experience the story.I urge writers to never think of the protagonist as the “hero” or even “main character.” To see this character as a hero reduces the character to a one-dimensional, cardboard character, ala “Dudley Doright.” Moral qualities, such as good and bad, shouldn’t apply to the protagonist or the antagonist. Can they be good or bad? Sure, but to define them in that way as their chief characteristic makes it likely you’ll create cartoonish characters rather than fully-developed literary characters. To see this character as your “main character” reduces the value of characterization to the novel and overemphasizes plot. And, there is one protagonist per novel, not several. Not “co-protagonists” or multiple protagonists. That person can have multiple “helpers” or aides or helpers, but it needs to be one person we see.Antagonist: The individual whose goal conflicts with that of the protagonist’s surface problem goal always and sometimes the story-worthy goal as well.It’s even more important not to think of the antagonist as a villain. Even more so than the protagonist, that can really lead to a Snidely Whiplash type of character. Can he or she be a bad or evil person? Certainly, but you’ll create a much more believable and interesting character if you simply view that person as an individual whose goal conflicts with that of the protagonist. The villain can also have as many lieutenants or allies as you wish.Inciting incident: Something that happens to the protagonist that creates and/or reveals the surface story problem to the protagonist. The inciting incident is what needs to begin the contemporary novel. Anything before that event is backstory or setup and shouldn’t precede the inciting incident beginning. If the backstory is important, it can come later, once the reader is invested in the protagonist’s problem. Novels are about one thing only and always—trouble. Today’s novels need to begin when the trouble begins, not before. And, the trouble has to begin with the inciting incident as before that happens there is no trouble, at least not in story terms.Surface story problem: A bona fide problem that is revealed to the protagonist as a result of the inciting incident. While it is a serious problem, it’s not as serious as the story-worthy problem it’s symptomatic of. Usually, it’s posed as a somewhat superficial goal—love, money, solving a crime, achieving success of some kind, etc.Story-worthy problem: The “real” problem of the protagonist and which the surface problem is symptomatic of. It’s usually a deep-seated psychological problem. The story-worthy problem isn’t known to the protagonist at the beginning of the story. It is only through the struggle to resolve the surface problem that the more important problem begins to be revealed, and the full realization is usually achieved in the final scene when both the surface problem and story-worthy problem are resolved. Although the story-worthy problem isn’t revealed to the protagonist until they’ve gone through the struggle to resolve the surface problem, the author should be aware of it so that he or she can create an effective plot to get to that point.Plot: A plot is simply a point-by-point list of all the causal actions that the protagonist takes to resolve the problem. A plot will show such things as: inciting incident, which leads to awareness of problem, first step to resolve the problem, which leads to disaster (failure to achieve the main goal), which leads to step two and so on, against increasing opposition, until the last scene in which the problem is resolved. The “spine” of the book and the plot is the protagonist’s problem and that problem should color every single page in the novel and be behind every action he or she takes. If coincidence occurs, it must always have a negative effect on the protagonist and should never be the source of help or in resolving the problem. If coincidence helps the protagonist, then what you have is what is called a… idiot plot. Don’t go there!Goals: Both the protagonist and the antagonist have goals. Each of their goals is to resolve their individual surface problems. While the protagonist will also end up having a story-worthy problem goal, the antagonist doesn’t. His or hers is only a surface problem that just happens to be in conflict with the protagonist’s problem.These definitions may or may not be instantly clear to you at this point, but after our time here together should be. I’d just like you to be aware of them so that this makes sense as you read on.So, okay, where’s the stuff about novel endings? Relax! It’s coming, I promise.To illustrate all of this, I’d like to use a teaching model I use quite often. The film, Thelma & Louise, written by Callie Khouri. It’s a film most people have seen so it should be a familiar model. You might want to rent it again to refresh your memory.Let’s go through the story.First, the inciting incident. Remember, this is something that happens to the protagonist that creates and/or reveals the surface story problem.The inciting incident in T&L is in the beginning, where the protagonist, Thelma (no co-protagonists here, although sometimes people mistakenly think Louise is a co-protagonist.) She’s not. She’s the Older Mentor character, if you want to ascribe a label to her. The incident occurs when Thelma’s talking to her husband Darryl as he prepares to leave for work. It’s been established that she is required to ask his permission before embarking on her weekend trip with Louise. She starts to ask him twice for that permission. There’s important backstory here, but it’s not revealed until much later in the story when the two women pick up J.T. and talk and Thelma reveals she’s been married to him for four years and dated him through all four years of high school. The backstory is that she’s been with Darryl for eight years and probably in an abusive relationship. That’s shown by the way they talk to each other. All that’s needed. The intelligent reader/viewer “gets” that instantly.Thelma is fully aware she’s in a bad situation, and, from time-to-time has performed actions to deal with it. She’s probably spit in Darryl’s food, gossiped and complained about him to Louise, not given her all in bed, whatever. Other times, she ignores her problem. But, it’s not yet to the point where it becomes the biggest single problem in her life and at a stage where nothing can get in the way of her resolving it. That’s what’s required to raise what’s only a “bad situation” to the level of becoming a story. If she can still ignore it for a time, can alibi what her true state is for a time to herself, can even forget her problem for a time… then it’s not yet a story. It’s only when she reaches her tipping point, when that “straw that broke the camel’s back” moment occurs and reveals to her that it’s the single biggest problem in her life and that she can no longer ignore it, even briefly, that it becomes a story. In T&L, Thelma’s inciting incident is a small, dramatic moment. We’ve seen clearly via the phone conversations with Louise that it’s imperative Thelma ask Darryl for permission to go on the trip with her. She even begins to… twice. It’s the second time she starts to ask his permission that constitutes her inciting incident. It’s what Darryl does to her—remember?—the inciting incident is something that happens to the protagonist? What Darryl does, is something he’s no doubt done before, But—this time it’s different. This time it’s the one time too many that he’s done this. And what does he do? Simple. She attempts to ask him the second time for permission and he crudely and rudely dismisses her, treating her as an annoyance rather than as his wife and a person. It’s the tipping point for her, the inciting incident, the thing that finally reveals her problem clearly to her. (Keep in mind that the word “problem” in story terms doesn’t have the same definition as the lay term. In story terms, it’s more than a bad situation—it’s a problem that the protagonist won’t let go away until it’s resolved.)Here’s the actual scene:THELMA goes through the living room to the bottom of the stairs and leans on the banister.THELMA(hollering again)Darryl! Honey, you’d better hurry up.DARRYL comes trotting down the stairs. Polyester was made for this man and he’s dripping in “men’s” jewelry. He manages a Carpeteria.DARRYL(annoyed)Dammit, Thelma, don’t holler like that! Haven’t I told you I can’t stand it when you holler in the morning?THELMA(sweetly and coyly)I’m sorry, Doll, I just didn’t want you to be late.DARRYL is checking himself out in the hall mirror and it’s obvious he likes what he sees. He exudes confidence for reasons that never become apparent. He likes to think of himself as a real lady-killer. He is making imperceptible adjustments to his overmoused hair. THELMA watches approvingly.(My note. This was the setup. Now comes the inciting incident.)THELMA          Hon.DARRYL(still annoyed)What.THELMA(she decides not to tell him.)Have a good day at work today.DARRYL          Uh-huh.THELMAHon?DARRYL(as if he’s trying to concentrate.)What?!THELMA          You want anything special for dinner?And, that’s the inciting incident. For perhaps the hundredth time (or more!) in their relationship, she started to do what she’s always done in the past—ask for her husband’s permission to go on the trip. But… something’s different this time. With his evident attitude—his crude dismissal of her and of anything she’s trying to say—she reaches her limit. Before this point, she’s just put up with him and played the dutiful wife. This time, her problem is clearly revealed to her. The little light in the refrigerator of her mind just clicked on. This is why it’s important to understand the complete definition of the inciting incident. (The inciting incident is something that happens to the protagonist that creates and/or reveals the story problem to her.) If she has what appears to be a problem but it’s not clearly revealed to her that she has, then it’s not yet a problem in story terms. It has to be revealed and clearly to her. That’s the only thing in the definition that has to be there in the inciting incident scene. The problem—at least to others—may have been there for a long time. She may have even been very aware of a bad situation. But, until that moment when it reaches the level of being the most important problem in her life—a problem that she can’t ignore another minute until it’s resolved—it’s only a bad situation and not a story problem.Also, the inciting incident should be a dramatic scene, not a melodramatic one. And this is. A small, dramatic opening should then begin to build until the biggest scene of all—the final one. Many writers make the mistake of thinking they have to open with not a dramatic scene, but a melodramatic one. If you open with a murder, kidnapping, bomb explosion and the like—where do you go from there? More murders, more kidnappings, bigger bombs? This is not to say a novel can’t open with that kind of thing, but if your novel’s not a thriller, per se, you might want to reconsider that strategy.Some believe the inciting incident was when Harlan tried to rape Thelma. Nope. That’s just the “Point of No Return” moment. That event wouldn’t have even been possible if Thelma had asked for Darryl’s permission. That was the real inciting incident—an event from which everything else derived.And Darryl isn’t the antagonist. Not even close. He’s a one-dimensional, cardboard character. A cartoon. Snidley Whiplash. The antagonist? Hal, the Arkansas cop. Remember, Thelma’s goal, as it evolves, is to escape being caught. Hal’s goal is to catch her. He’s not a bad guy at all (remember, I said to not think of the antagonist as a “villain?”). He’s one of the best and nicest guys in the story. He wants to save the two women, first from going to jail, and in the end, from being killed. His goals are strictly good and honorable. His goal simply opposes Thelma’s goal and that’s the only definition of an antagonist.Thelma’s surface problem is to escape Darryl’s domination… for a weekend. See who and what kind of  person her husband is, creates instantly reader identification for her as well as sympathy and empathy. Already, we’d like to see her have some fun. It’s obvious she’s had very little with this butthole.So, her surface problem is Darryl’s domination of her. But, remember I said the surface problem is only symptomatic of the much bigger, much more important, deeper psychological problem the protagonist faces? It’s very true in this story. The story begins with Thelma trying to resolve the surface problem—escaping Darryl’s domination, even if for just a weekend—but, as events progress, little by little, Thelma eventually comes to the realization that she has a much bigger problem. That she’s forced to exist in a male-dominated world. It’s much bigger than just Darryl.I wanted to go over these things so that the ending—which is what this is all about!—makes complete sense. Now. Here’s the definition of a quality ending:Ending: A novel ending should contain two elements—a win and a loss. That’s in terms of the protagonist’s goals, both surface and story-worthy. Years ago, we used to teach writers that endings should be either “goal-achieved” or “goal-unachieved.” Like most things, we’ve learned better ways to express story structure. An ending that only achieves the protagonist’s goal as well as an ending in which is the protagonist’s goal is lost are both incomplete and unsatisfactory endings. There must be elements of both to make it a good ending.Like everything important in a story, the ending should always be presented as a scene. Never by exposition or summary or the character ruminating in his/her head. Through a scene. And, there are particular requirements for this scene. As Janet Burroway, in her classic text, Writing Fiction, says about resolutions: “Here the epiphany, a memory leading to a resolution, has been triggered by an action and sensory details that the reader can share.” (Italics mine.) It’s a scene that can’t depend on conversation to make it work. It can’t, for instance, have the protagonist talking to a priest who then convinces her of a truth, and that gives her her epiphany. The resolution has to be triggered by an action—and an “action” in this case, isn’t dialog. It has to be a physical action.What’s the physical action in the ending of T&L? That’s easy. They’re just been chased and are now surrounded on all sides by cops who are ordering them to put their hands up or get killed. Surrounded on all sides except in front of them, where the Grand Canyon lies. Sensory details? Plenty! Cops jacking shells into carbines, a helicopter’s rotors swirling dust, an authoritative voice over a bullhorn demanding they surrender. No way out, except… This triggers the epiphany for Thelma. And, what is the memory that leads to a resolution for her? Again, easy. Even though we can’t see it in the film, we understand what’s going through her mind. The memory of Darryl and her abusive relationships, and, even more important, the new knowledge that her entire world is controlled by men as evidenced by what’s happened in their journey. Selfish men, like Darryl, evil men like the tanker truck driver and Harlan, the would-be rapist, manipulative men like J.T., and even good, moral men, like Hal and Louise’s boyfriend, Jimmy. But… all men. At the very end, Thelma realizes her surface problem (getting free of Darryl, even if just for a weekend) is only symptomatic of a much bigger and deeper, psychological problem for her—having to exist in a male-dominated world with no voice at all. She didn’t know this at the beginning. In the beginning, she was only aware that Darryl was a shit. In the end, as a result of everything she’d gone through, she finally comes to the realization that Darryl was only a small part of what she faced in society.And so, she does the only thing left for her to do. She and Louise tacitly agree to commit suicide. They seal their decision with a kiss and then hold hands as they hurtle into infinity. And, that, satisfies the two elements in a quality ending, by providing both a win and a loss. The loss? Easy. She gives up her life. The win? Again, easy. She achieves her independence from men on her own terms. It cost her her life, but the tradeoff was worth it to her.This is a fairly common ending. It’s seen, for instance, in Toni Morrison’s novel Beloved, where the mother kills her child to keep her from having to live in slavery. It’s seen in any number of war novels where the protagonist gives up his or her life to preserve a way of life for loved ones.This doesn’t mean protagonist have to commit suicide to achieve a good ending. This is just one of countless possible endings. But, however you end your story, just make sure it contains both a win and a loss for the protagonist. That’s key.What’s interesting about this movie is that some of the studio execs wanted to change Khouri’s brilliant ending to a typical Hollywood “happy-sappy” ending. One where they surrendered, spent a few years in prison, and were released to live out some kind of Stepford wives’ existence ever after…Thankfully, she stood her ground and they released the intelligent version!Hope this helps you in creating your own endings. Hope to see your work on the shelves of Border’s and Barnes & Noble!BTW, if you’re interested in seeing how actions can inform character arc, you might want to look at a post I have on my blog where I again use this movie to illustrate that technique.Blue skies,Les Edgerton"},

It probably won't sell well in Ft. Wayne...   WE'RE NUMBER ONE (With a bullet)!Some Idle Musings on Food and Sports and the Weather in Ft. Wayne, Indiana            I'm darned proud to be a Hoosier.            Especially lately.            In the last year alone, we were declared by a national magazine to rank near the top, nationally, in obesity.            Just as we were getting over basking in the glow of that singular honor, Miami Herald columnist Dave Barry announced the results of a highly-scientific poll he'd recently conducted... that Indiana had clearly won the title of the \"Silliest State Nickname.\"            Hoosiers.            Yep. Thas' the one. Not to be confused with \"Hoseheads.\" Them's the folks from Canada, I think.            No other state was even close in the balloting. Of course, this was a vote taken in Miami, Florida, so who knows if hanging chads were counted and if not, how accurate the poll actually was.            No matter. We'll take it, by cracky. (Famous Hoosier euphemism.)            With the twofer honor we nailed this year, it may be a good opportunity to update our glorious nickname. Something like, \"Hoosier Tubbies.\" Now, that's got a ring to it, by golly (another interesting Hoosier euphemism), and if we could get the state legislature to act on it (or act on anything), it's not inconceivable that we could end up with an unprecedented \"two-peat\" next year as winners of Barry's poll.            The next year we go for Hoosier Starchbabies and score an unprecedented \"three-peat!\"            Although, I don't understand how our great state ends up skinny-challenged. Have you checked out the grub we eat? I moved here after living in Texas, California and New Orleans and other environs and immediately noticed a difference in the cuisine.            Mondo difference.            The first entrée I was introduced to upon entering \"Hoosierland\" (another adorable Hoosier euphemism) was a delightful little number called... well, I don't know what it was called. I named it \"white stuff.\" Mashed potatoes dumped on top of noodles.            Or maybe it was the other way around. Hard to tell. They're both white. Upon reflection, I think it was noodles on top of mashed potatoes. Noodles are the slimy things, right? And potatoes are the lumpy objects? Then, I stand corrected. It was noodles on top of potatoes. Usually served with white bread slathered with oleo. Washed down with milk.            Really.            Honest-to-God.            I can still remember the one-of-a-kind flavor. Kind of like what I imagine a dish made up of pulverized flakes from the box your Amana refrigerator came in, mixed in with lead-based white paint (glossy) might taste like. And the servings! Hoosier chefs don't serve those little sissy portions like you might get in a four-star French restaurant. Nosiree! (Yet another of those catchy Hoosier euphemisms) Nope—you get a mound of white stuff plopped on your plate, high enough that you have to kind of raise up in your seat to see your dining partner across from you.            Actually, to make eye contact, you'd both have to raise up.            Folks were asking for seconds.            As Dave Barry might say: \"I'm not making this up.\"            I quickly discovered a Hoosier's idea of a spice rack. That would consist of a pair of salt and pepper shakers.            I've learned it's best to pray after you eat in Indiana.            And turn the smoke alarm off until after the dishes (Hoosiers pronounce this word \"deeshes\") are done. Only... we don't say, \"after the dishes deeshes are done. We say, \"We're fixin' to rid up the table and warsh the deeshes.\"            I'm not making this up, either.            I wish I was.            And, speaking of religion, that allows me to lead smoothly and seamlessly into... you guessed it...            Sports!            Specifically, sports as reported by Fort Wayne sportswriters.            Now, I lived in South Bend for quite a while and the sports reporting there is actually quite good. On a par with any newspapers in the country. But, then, they've got an advantage. They have an actual team close by. Notre Dame. A team that people farther than twenty miles away from town have heard of.            Ft. Wayne's a bit different.            The main sports \"team\" in town is a group of dentally-challenged guys who play something called \"hockey.\" Before 7,633 \"Hoosier Tubbies\" wandering around Memorial Coliseum, crabbing about the long lines at the Ice Cream Dots stand. Notre Dame, on the other hand, has ten thousand people waiting to use the restrooms at an average football game at any given moment. There're 20,000 people who couldn't get a ticket tailgating in the N.D. parking lot during games.            Which gives Ft. Wayne sportswriters an inferiority complex. Most of 'em didn't start out to cover a sport drawing a crowd that would be comfortable in a phone booth. They had grand visions of writing Red Smith-like stories about real sports and recognizable teams and individuals. Instead, they found themselves in... Ft. Wayne.            You gotta feel for 'em.            I have to stop here and explain why I picked Ft. Wayne for this discourse. Reason is, this is where I currently live. It's not my first choice (to be honest, it isn't in my list of the first 1200 places I'd pick to live either), but it's where my stuff is and I have to be here to watch it.            If you want to experience what life was like in this country 211 years ago, just come to Ft. Wayne and wander around. BTW, that used to be the official Indiana slogan, displayed on license plates. Wander Indiana. I’m not making this up.I always got images of travelers, lost in cornfields, looking for a way out… There's no other town like Ft. Wayne in Indiana. Or the country. It was settled by German burghers and has managed to retain the mindset of the original settlers. Picture a giant croissant roll, smothered with real butter. That's the official symbol for the Ft. Wayne mindset. That's because of the geography. It's miles and miles from anything. South Bend, a similarly-sized city, is a cosmopolitan environment for a couple-three reasons. There's Notre Dame with a sophisticated student body and professors from all over the world. Smart people. Hip people. It's also in close proximity to Chicago and that helps South Benders keep up with the current century somewhat. It was also settled by more diverse cultures than these Germans here in the Fort. Italians, Poles, Belgians, just for starters.            They've even got the Mafia in South Bend. Even though Ft. Wayne's got three rivers, which you'd imagine would come in handy for dumping unreasonable business associates, the Mafia would never consider setting up a branch office here. The reason? That white stuff people make you eat. Can you picture that guy on The Sopranos wading through a pile of noodles and mashed potatoes? He'd be laughed out of the Cosa Nostra. Plus the fact that they wouldn't be able to film him without going to wide screen technology.            Ft. Wayne gives itself two titles. \"The City of Churches\" is one. That's basically in homage to the entertainment value of the place. Gobs of folks all over the country are packing their Bibles up right now so they can move to a place with hundreds of churches. On every corner. Believe it!            The second title Ft. Wayner's give themselves is... are you ready? \"The City of Restaurants.\"            Go ahead. I'll wait a minute while you get that last little fit of giggling out and compose yourself.            There're restaurants, all right. Tons of them. Drive down the street and you'll see: Church, restaurant, church, restaurant, church... well, you get the picture. Problem is, they all have the same menu, which looks like this:*                                                          *                                                          *Today's Special: \"White stuff.\"Manager's guarantee:Absolutely guaranteed to not have a scintilla of flavor or double your money back. Second and even third helpings encouraged. Our doggie bags are the Great Danes of doggy bags. They're the Shetland ponies of doggie bags! Enjoy!*                                                          *                                                          *            One of the local rags used to have a \"Food Critic\" (I use the term loosely), whose idea of great restaurant was a joint that \"served all the fish (pronounced \"feesh\"—another of those colorful Hoosier euphemisms) you can eat for 99¢.\" She'd rave about all the bread they served and the desserts. If she'd ever opened her own café, an appropriate name might have been, \"Starch and Sugar By The Forklift.\" She got the gig as food critic because of an important talent she possessed. She liked to eat. A lot. Often. She even wrote reviews of fast-food outlets, those places she liked to visit between main meals to keep her typing strength up. Very entertaining and informative. James Beard perhaps she wasn't, but if you wanted to know who served \"all the feesh you can eat for 99¢\" she was your critic. She once wrote a column the main focus of which was the management didn't have crackers on the table to munch on while you were waiting for the main spread and between courses. Another time, she wrote about a dish she'd ordered that had a French name, which literally described the dish. \"Piscé a tete\" or something like that. Translation: \"Fish with the head still attached to the main body and with a sprig of parsley in the mouth orifice.\" Her entire column was a complaint that they served her a fish with the fish noggin still on it and she should have had the option of having it removed.            My favorite was the time she reviewed this restaurant and rattled off 10-11 main entrées she'd partaken of, and then, immediately following her rave of all she'd ingested, she wrote this sentence: \"And you wouldn't think we'd have room for dessert!\" No, you wouldn't, unless you weighed six hundred pounds or were a small country in the Balkans.            Turns out she found some room, somewhere. Enough for a couple of different pies and cobblers and a random scoop of ice cream or seven, if I disremember right...            Go figure.            Since cooking with the head attached results in a more flavorful fish, I can see her point. Her taste buds weren't accustomed to... taste.            I wrote a somewhat critical \"Letter to the Editor\" about one of her columns once and was amazed when collecting my mail one day to discover a personal letter from her, a scathing indictment in which she took me to task for daring to question her food judgment. That blasted away whatever naïve assumptions I had about journalistic integrity and ethics in \"The City of Churches/Restaurants.\" Which works differently here, it seems, than in say, Chicago or Goober Falls, Idaho. Ever since then, I've been sweating out a possible visit from the First Amendment Police to give me the rubber hose treatment for daring to... criticize a restaurant critic. (Statute B-11231-d, Indiana State Blue Laws)            As both Dave Barry and I say, and quite often: \"I'm not making this up.\"            When I'm not enjoying the local delectable cuisine and chuckling over another sport page article, counting the misspelled words and misquotes, I'm usually sitting outside soaking up the amazing weather. Most often, wearing three sweaters, a parka and long underwear. In August. To completely appreciate the seasons here (in order, there's winter, then sleet, then cold rain, then cloudy weather, then some late snow, then two days of summer during which there's a 62% chance of rain and maybe a tornado), it helps to have a historical perspective of how \"The City of Churches\" came to be. General Anthony Wayne was ordered to build a military fort here and he couldn't wait to leave. When he got here and stepped off the Amtrak Silver Wayward Bullet, the place was essentially The Dismal Swamp. (I'm not making this up.) General Tony hated the place and couldn't wait to get killed by an Indian or transferred to a more civilized place, like say, Beirut or Hades.            In conclusion (French word, meaning \"I'm wrapping this baby up so I can catch the \"Man Show\"), I'm sure this highly-accurate, nonpartisan, nonbiased piece will bring a letter or two (written in crayon), providing me with clever, trés-original advice to, \"love it or leave it,\" or, \"if you don't like it here, why don't you move?—we like our city and state and there's no room for Commies like you here!\"            I can't wait.            Just to set the record straight, it's only \"The City of Churches\" I'm not overly-enthusiastic about. I prefer cities and Ft. Wayne just doesn't fit the definition of a city. Feels more like a spread-out collection of housing additions and developments. Maybe it's the \"Caution! Deer Crossing!” signs I see on the \"city\" streets... On the other hand, South Bend and a number of other places do have the wonderful atmosphere \"real\" cities do and I really dig getting to go there when I can.            To balance this op-piece and in the interests of fairness, Ft.  Wayne does have some good things going for it.            Ft. Wayne is proud to be the home of the famous Potato Chip Lady who appeared on the \"Tonight Show.\" I think I can speak for most Ft. Wayner's when I say how chagrined we were when Johnny Carson, during the interview, reached over and ate one of her prized chips. The one that looked like Dick Nixon, I believe.            Talk about a state of mourning for an entire city! I know of several neighbors who switched to the Letterman Show immediately following that horrifying incident.            And Johnny Appleseed had the bad luck to die here before he could get out of town and you can visit his grave any time you want to. Talk about your goosebumps and high entertainment value! Looking down on that lump of grass does something to a person.            That counts for something.            And, things are changing. We're getting slimmer in these parts. Lots of us are jogging to Mickey D's these days and the pounds are melting off, not piling up as fast. And we're not fat. We're merely \"pleasantly-plump.\"            Pass the white stuff, willya? Where're the crackers? A bustling downtown!"},

Lately, I’ve been corresponding with several writers about this subject and it seems as if many of today’s writers don’t really know how to deal with their work being turned down. Not that it’s ever been easy, but it seems as if more people give up on their work earlier than in years past. I thought perhaps it might be helpful to give my own experience with rejection, which is similar to what many other writers in the past have gone through.Actually, this post was triggered by a client of mine, whom I won’t name, but I don’t think she’d mind my using her as an example. I’ll call her “Ruth.”A bit of background. I was hired by Ruth to coach her in the final rewrite of her novel—an amazing book, by the way. After she wrote “The End” I recommended her and her novel to five leading literary agencies. From four of them, she received invitations to submit her entire novel and the fifth requested the first fifty pages. This, in itself, is fairly remarkable. Not a single pass among the bunch! As this was Ruth’s first experience in submitting to professionals, she assumed this was the norm.As it transpired, almost immediately she received an offer of representation from one of the agencies. She emailed me and asked what she should do. I suggested she email the remaining four to let them know she had an offer and would give them a few days to respond before she made a decision. Two of them wrote back with lengthy emails to her telling her how remarkable her novel was (and it is!), but they both passed for legitimate reasons, none of which were because of the quality of the work, but more because of the state of the market. She’s still waiting on the other two who are feverishly reading it before the weekend. She has a scheduled phonecon with the agent who offered representation. We’ll know by Monday probably who she’ll sign with. This is all happening within two weeks of her finishing her novel.Anyway, what prompted me to consider writing this was a question Ruth posed in an email to me during all of this, when she asked: “Is it common to get two rejections?”Here was my reply:Hi Ruth,I had to laugh at your question, \"Is it common to get two rejections?\" Why? Because my first novel got 86 rejections... and that's closer to “normal”... And, it was purely an accident it was taken by the 87th. So, two rejections is... not anything at all. What's really abnormal is to get 4-5 top agents to even look at a manuscript, especially today. To even get an agent to look at it--the odds are that if a writer sent out 20 queries, she'd probably get a request for a partial would be one or two at most. Probably none for a full mss. And, chances are slim that the one or two who asked for a partial would ask for more. It's really a jungle out there. It is much easier these days with email from before when we only had snail mail and had to provide postage for a return and wait for the mails both ways, but it's still difficult. Getting four of five agents to look at a full mss and the other to ask for the first fifty pages is really incredible.Ruth’s question was perfectly legitimate considering this was her first novel and her first foray into obtaining an agent. It also seems to reflect the mindset of many writers these days. It’s just not realistic, as she’ll find out as time goes on and she begins to see the experience of other authors. Although, she’s going to end up with an agent fairly readily and I anticipate publication of her novel and even high sales. It’s that good and it’s a timely novel for a lot of reasons. I think it will be one of those rare first novels that garners awards and enjoys handsome sales.But, her experience is not the norm. Not even close. I might add that what I worked on with her wasn’t a first draft. She’s taken over twenty classes in writing, written innumerable drafts, and had her work edited by a great number of people. I was just the last. She’d spent three years writing it. It was a polished version that she ended up with. She’d absolutely gone the distance and done everything she should have with her novel. In other words, she was prepared for the opportunity that came along.But, even so, it was remarkable to get these responses from these agents, all of whom are considered the tops in the business.Here was my own experience a long time ago. Markedly different as you’ll see.I sent my first novel, The Death of Tarpons, out 86 times to editors. Eighty-six times! My wife Mary describes me as “bullheaded,” while I prefer the much more accurate, “stubborn.”Sending out a novel in those days (eighties and nineties) was vastly different than today. For one thing, we didn’t have email. Al Gore was inventing other stuff then, I imagine. How to find the perfect massage, possibly… We did have email, but very few, if any, publishers were accepting submissions or queries via the Internet. Everyone insisted on snail mail. The following was the procedure in those days for you younger writers who’ve only known the Internet.1. Send via snail mail, a query letter, with SASE (Self-Addressed Stamped Envelop). A one-page letter, created especially for the particular publisher. Took some research to individualize each letter. Pay for stamps and envelops and paper.2. Wait anywhere from a week to six months for a response from the publisher. An average wait would be six to eight weeks. A yea or nay. Sometimes, the next step would be for the publisher to request a partial. Rare to ask for the full mss. Again, this had to be sent via snail mail and had to include return postage and a mailer to return your work in.3. Wait anywhere for a week to six months for a response. Most of the time that was a “Not for us.” Occasionally, a request for the full mss. Again, sent with postage both ways and a mailer for them to return your mss in. These were all hard copy requests. You either printed the copies yourself (no dot matrix allowed, even though most of us couldn’t afford anything else) which represented significant printer ink cartridge and paper costs) or you took it to a Kinkos or other copy shop and paid for it. You could usually resend the same returned mss a couple of times at best. After that, if it looked the slightest shopworn you couldn’t send it, but had to print up a new copy. I remember searching for places that had “specials” at ten cents a page, and rarely, even five cents a page. When you’re talking about a 400-page manuscript at say the bargain rate of five cents a page, plus postage both ways, plus the cost of two envelops, and/or stationary boxes to send a complete manuscript in, you’re talking about a significant outlay of money. Not to mention the time and energy required to print off copies yourself if you chose that route, or even to drive to and from Kinkos. To send a mss in those days represented a true commitment to their work on the part of the writer! The same situation existed for any kind of submissions, including poetry, short stories and nonfiction book proposals.Repeat this 86 times. (Actually, 87, as it was the 87th who finally bought it.) That was my experience. That’s a bit on the high side for most writers who ended up published, but in talking to many of my peers at the time who sold their work, I’d say the average was close to fifty submissions.This was at a time when we didn’t have much money (kind of the same thing these days, actually…) and my wife, bless her, never begrudged a dime of the literally thousands of dollars I spent in pursuit of publication.And, the publisher who did end up taking it did so only by accident. If not for her, I might still be sending it out.What happened was I’d set myself a limit of 100 submissions. Actually, I was almost out of places to send it to.Let me back up a bit…On my third submission, a regional publisher in Houston, called me and was really excited about the book and offered me $10,000 for an advance, a fairly large advance in those days for a first novel. Was I thrilled? You bet. However, I ended up refusing his offer, a decision I second-guess just about every day since then. First, he asked me how autobiographical the book was. About 90-95% I told him. Well, this was the answer he was waiting for, as he got real excited then and said he wanted to bring it out not as a novel, but as an autobiography or memoir. I couldn’t do that, I said, as five to ten percent is fictionalized, and I didn’t think to label it autobiography would be ethical. Okay, he said, visibly disappointed. We still had a deal until he told me the other things he wanted to do with it. One, he said, he wanted to cut certain scenes. A prime example is that in one scene my protagonist’s father whips him with a lived king snake. We’ll have to cut that, he said, so as not to offend the “snake lovers.” That would be what? I asked. Ten-fifteen people? Mostly California residents? I couldn’t do that, I said. For one thing, it was one of the most powerful scenes in the book, and for another, it was one of those “true things” he was gaga about. Our relationship was getting distinctly cool at that point, but we still had a handshake deal until he came out with the thing that broke this camel’s back. I’d named it Spatterdashers and he insisted we rename it, A Boy and His Dog. I distinctly remember beginning to retch when he said that.And that was the end of that. I thanked him and pulled the book from him. At the time, I remember thinking that only the third publisher I’d sent it to had wanted it and had offered a decent advance—therefore, this was going to be a breeze selling it.I had no idea it was going to take over eighty submissions later to do that. If I’d known that, I might have taken his offer.As it happened, the 87th place I sent it to was the University of North Texas Press. In my ignorance, I didn’t realize they had never published any fiction at the time. As the story was told to me later, my opus was sitting on the desk of the publisher, Fran Vick, and she was getting ready to slip a form rejection into it and send it back. Her secretary was a bit late in getting her morning coffee to her, so just to kill a minute or two, she decided to read the first page. A purely by chance moment. In the first page, she happened on the words, “Freeport, Texas.” Which was where the novel was set. The town I grew up in. And… coincidentally, the town Ms Vick was from. Seeing her hometown on the first page, prompted her to keep reading. And, once she started, she said she couldn’t put it down. Result: she loved it and phoned me to see if she could buy it.When it came out, it was nominated for the Violet Crown Book Award and received a Special Citation from the Violet Crown folks. It completely sold out. And, it was the University of North Texas Press’s first fiction offering. They subsequently published a collection of my stories, another “first” for them.And now… to back it up even further (ala a Pulp Fiction plot structure)…A scant two weeks before I sent it to UNT, the same manuscript had been selected for a small workshop led by uber-agent Mary Evans in Indianapolis. During a break in the workshop, Mary asked me to go outside with her and while I was toking on a Camel regular, she said, “This is a truly brilliant novel, but you’re having trouble selling this, aren’t you, Les?” Well, yes I was, kind of… Eighty plus rejections would make it fit that assessment… She said she’d had the same problem with her own client, Michael Chabron, with his first novel, The Mysteries of Pittsburgh. Mary said, that what was happening with my novel was the same thing that had happened with Michael’s. Because my protagonist was a 14-year-old boy, publishers were viewing it as a YA. And, she explained, “teenaged boys are the single-worst demographic in publishing.” As a group, they simply don’t read. I protested that I’d never viewed it as a YA and offered up John Knowles A Separate Peace as an example. “That’s about a teenaged boy and nobody thinks of it as a YA,” I said.Mary agreed, but said that publishers tend to pigeon-hole books and the simple fact that my book began with him at age 14 was dooming it to be considered as a YA. She suggested I do the same thing she’d had Michael do, and that was to write two additional chapters, and transform it into a frame story. Begin, she said, with Cory as an old man looking back on his childhood and make that the new chapter one, and add a chapter at the end, coming back to him in his old age. She said that’s exactly what she’d had Michael do and once he’d done that, it sold to the very next publisher she’d submitted it to.Well, I took her advice. Added the two chapters, transformed it into a frame story, and the first house I sent it to was… you guessed it. The University of North Texas Press. Also, in the original version, the words “Freeport, Texas” didn’t appear on the first page and Fran would have undoubtedly not kept on reading when her hometown didn’t appear at that first glance.This is all to illustrate several things. One, that getting published was a whole lot harder back then, not to mention far more expensive and time-consuming… and also, that like then, luck plays a huge part in getting published. It’s often not enough to just be talented and write even a brilliant book. It’s almost as important sometimes to just be lucky. And, also that listening to people who know what they’re talking about is kind of a good thing to do.The thing is, things have changed and, believe it or not, for the better! Today, with the Internet and most agents and editors accepting email queries and submissions, it’s a whole new world and much, much easier to submit. Of course, that also leads to more people submitting than ever before. I don’t imagine that nearly as many people would send out submissions if it cost them twenty to thirty bucks per submission these days! (I seem to remember the figure $9.20 being the average postage cost, one-way, for a novel submission.) That means that to submit a complete mss, would require $18.40 for postage, a couple of bucks for the mailers and stationary boxes to send it in, printing costs of $15-$20 at five cents a page.So, to answer Ruth’s question: Yes, it’s pretty common to get two rejections…Story about short stories and publishing. Years ago, when I was a student at Vermont College getting my MFA, I was a bit discouraged. I had my novel out before going there and UNT was publishing my collection of short stories, and I was writing a lot of short stories then, but somewhat discouraged at the rate of rejection. I asked my then-advisor, Diane Lefer, what the average ratio of acceptance/rejection was for a “good” writer. Diane said that for an established writer, the ratio was roughly about one acceptance for every thirty submissions. Made me feel lots better as I was averaging an acceptance for every 18 submissions. Again, sometimes it just helps to know other writer’s experiences to gauge where you’re at yourself.Now, for the good news.I’ve painted kind of a “gloom and doom” picture of submissions/acceptances, but here’s the good news. Once you get your first novel or nonfiction book published; once you get your first few short stories published… the doors begin to swing wide open. I’ve since published nine books with more to shortly become published. I haven’t written short stories in years—to be honest, there’s no money in short stories, so I don’t spend the time on them, but on nonfiction books and novels instead these days—but now I get requests from magazines for stories. And, contrary to popular wisdom, when you achieve a certain status, they actually pay decent money for them. (Don’t expect much money to be offered unless you’re somewhat of a “name,” however—you have to earn your chops before that happens.) So what I do these days is I usually “cannibalize” unsold novels in my “only available in my room” dead novel trunk and send those to the requesting magazine. The point is, once you’re published, it gets infinitely easier from then on.Just expect rejection when you first begin. It’s something virtually all of us who are now published went through. It’s not fun at all, but it seems pretty du rigueur for those of us who write. Just part of the deal. If you get published easier and quicker, then my hat’s off to you. If you don’t, then don’t give up. If you believe in your work, chances are that one person you need to say yes, will do so at some point. And it only takes one such yes. If you get a hundred no’s and one yes, you’re a success. And, each no you receive is just one step closer to that yes.Keep writing and keep sending your work out. You may not end up getting it published, but at least there’s the chance you will. If you don’t send it out, there’s no chance at all.Plus, it’s downright cheap to send stuff out these days! Unbelievably cheap! Take advantage of that.One way to handle rejection... Maybe not Politically Correct, but then nothing fun (or honest) is..."},

These are from when I was an associate editor with The Crescent Review over ten years ago. This was a very well-respected magazine--the NY Times dubbed it \"the most democratic literary magazine\" in the world. The reason was, almost all publications don't require their editors to read entire manuscript submissions. Tim Holland, the editor of CR did. In fact, each editor was required to submit a brief plot synopsis of each story along with our recommendations to \"prove\" we'd read the entire story. He felt (as did his editors) that if a person spent the time, effort and money to write and send us a short story, we owed it to that writer to read the entire thing. I can't think of any other publication that does this. At times, we held in our grubby little hands some really putrid stories and it seemed the really bad ones were always the longest ones(!), but we read 'em, every single word.We were asked to provide one of three recommendations for each story. A \"No\" a \"Yes\" or, an even more democratic thing, a \"Another reader\" in the event that we happened on a story we didn't like for personal reasons but saw literary merit it in. The \"Another reader\" manuscripts went to another editor for their take on it.I've taken off the names of the writers as well as the titles of their stories, as it isn't my aim to embarrass anyone. What's left is simply the story description and my recommendation. I thought this might give some writers an \"inside look\" at how editors look at submissions. It might be helpful to see what at least one editor (moi) looks for in a story and what gains a yes and what gains a no. If you ever get a chance to edit a magazine, I highly recommend the experience. You very quickly learn that what you thought were original ideas... aren't. At any moment, ten thousand other writers are probably writing the same story you thought you'd dreamed up by your lonesome...If you folks like, I have about 50 pages of these and would be glad to print some more.Beginning with...Conflict in the English department between repulsive Ursula Krinsky and the narrator-professor over pedagogy. Comes across as a diatribe for the narrator’s pov and reads more like a polemic than a story. Well-written in parts, but too much “back-story” for my taste and too much use of the past perfect tense, which renders it tensionless./NoBegins with a ten-year-old boy witnessing the murder of his teacher by his (implied) homosexual lover Ambrose and keeping his silence about it and then goes into a flashback where his father emotionally abuses him. From that, we get a glimpse of some neighbors who are even more brutish and then see the father in an even more violent scene with the boy, at the end of which he has an opportunity to save his father’s life but doesn’t. Neighbor Ambrose witnesses this and doesn’t tell on him, which is why he returns the favor when Ambrose kills his teacher. Some good moments, but overall, too stereotypical. Also violates Crescent’s cachets against a first-person pov and a victim theme. What is good about it is that it’s actually a “story” and with some work could be fairly good.Set in 1959 and from the pov of 16-year-old Butch whose Aunt Rose has just died. Butch tries to deal with death and his new awareness of life and is in the midst of working all that out. A coming-of-age story that's different from most. The writing style is lively and provides lots of nice little moments and insights. Really delightful./YesA story of nine-year-old Lydia during WWII right after she's just spent the last three years in a Japanese internment camp in East Java. A couple of stories going on here which dillutes the effect. Lots of back story and \"history\" that tend to stall the story. With some work, and focus on the real story here, this could be a good piece./NoRelationship story between son and his mother, written in stream-of-consciousness, lots of resentment, lots of \"literary\" language that seems to try too hard, but this \"take\" is probably only because it's not my cup of tea./Another readerAnother stream of consciousness piece, that I liked much better. (Second of two stories this writer sent.) This reads \"cinematically\" and is quite interesting as well as very effective poetical images. Kind of a take on death and AIDs and fragmentation of modern society-stuff. Style is engaging - fragmented and stacatto./Another readerIn debt, newly relocated from the Right to the Left Coast, the unnamed female narrator manages a long-distance romance while trying to make it as a musician and facing an early mid-life crisis. At odds over finances, each with a different value, a crisis point occurs when she becomes involved in a car-wreck insurance fraud and decides to keep illegally-gotten money and not tell her boyfriend. I really enjoyed the language in this one - great similes and metaphors - had a surprising twist at the end. Just a darn good yarn./YesThis is a story that requires several readings, mostly for the density of a complicated plot and many, many images. Laurie, young female American, living in Germany and studying baroque violin, meets Christoph, an old man along the Rhine and they become friends. He takes her home to meet his wife Bethy and they break bread together, Bethy quizzing Laurie about America and telling her own life story. Over several months, Laurie and Christoph develop a grandfather-granddaughter relationship, which renews his youth and Christoph arranges for Laurie to meet his divorced son Richi and the grandson has the same qualities as Christoph. Ends with the promise of love between the two. Well-written and complex, much like baroque music with its pacing and lushness./Another reader.Plot was a bit unclear to me. Narrator is (staying/working?) at a hotel named \"Angels Flight\" and is offered a job operating the dune lift. I just couldn't get into the read - didn't seem to make much sense. Sorry./NoTwo girls work in a mall, one as a clerk at Men's Casuals, and the other as a floorwalker, trying to snag shoplifters...only she's a shoplifter herself. They go through adventures in a club, score some weed, get stoned, score some to sell, the floorwalker gives away or uses most of it and has to leave the state before they find her./NoCooper has a meeting with his ex-wife Darcy (her request. Cooper has just had angioplasty, and is on vacation with his new wife Lorna. They have his two kids with him. His ex, Darcy is going to A.A. On the way, Cooper reminisces about their marriage and his recent heart problems and anticipates a blame-throwing meeting from Darcy. It turns out she's concerned about their son, Henry, about his bed-wetting. Back at the motel, with his new wife and the kids, he doesn't get anticipated grief from Lorna and they prepare to go to the airport. They go to a mall, first, and Henry and Cooper talk and Henry blames him for the divorce. Taking the kids - Henry and Cheryl - back to Darcy. They think they leave both kids, but on the way to the airport discover Henry has hidden in the trunk. His head is as wet as the morning when his father delivered him and he can think of nothing to say. I really like this story and even though it's long at 19 pages would advocate strong consideration./YesKind of a metafiction, where the author talks to his wife about writing a story and in the process tells her the story he wants to write, about a girl he picked up a long time ago, who had a mole. He told the girl he was a doctor and the mole looks bad; she should have her own doctor look at it. The wife accuses him of lying to the girl - that he isn't a doctor - and that maybe he lies all the time. The author's wife is the reason he can't write - she won't let him lie. Cute story - reminds somewhat of Carver./Another readerMilt Charwell is a mover and is over at his helper George's house, talking about moving a Mrs. Dawson in on the military base yesterday. George was home ill. Milt remembers his helper left his shirt there, so the next day he returns. She's looking at a letter he knows is from her husband who's away on duty. He recognizes it from the day before and has already made up his mind (negative) from the handwriting he'd glimpsed. He gets the shirt and leaves. He knows George is playing around with some of the moving clients and knows he has to fire him, especially when the same yearnings for Mrs. Dawson emerge in himself. Not one of those stories you can explain easily, but one that reverberates after you're done./Another readerA short while back the narrator lived in his parents' house in a neighborhood that has deteriorated. Dreamboat, a young black man from a halfway house across the street, with an electronic monitoring device attached to his ankle, approaches him and offers to paint his house. He can't go more than 150 feet in any direction, so the narrator marks the distances for him. Dreamboat recruits another resident, Ingram, who agrees to do the work while Dreamboat supervises from the house. In conversation, Ingram tells the narrator that Rufus, the parole officer owns the halfway house and collects the government checks that are supposed to go to the inmates. The narrator agrees to rent his house to Ingram, and the next day Dreamboat appears in the front yard and takes off his clothes, all except the tether, which he's trying to remove with a paint scraper. The narrator decides to help him remove it. They get it off and he aids Dreamboat's escape. Nobody comes./YesClyde Harrow, his mind affected by his stint in Vietnam, is known as \"Old Man Rags\". When his daughter dies, his mind finally goes and he quits his job as postmaster of a small southern town. Sam, the new postmaster, a man Harrow had befriended as a boy is nice to him. Harrow goes to his home and dreams of his dead daughter and his shack burns down. Sam finds him dead, dressed in a wig and dress and gets him out of it so he won't be ridiculed in memory. Sees a picture of Harrow's daughter - has feelings of arousal. Hasn't settled on a pov. Some good writing in parts./NoFiction writer Anne is afraid of intimacy, preferring the anonymity of New York to the intimacy of L.A. Married to a bond salesman, Anne came to L.A. to pitch her screenplay, staying at the Four Seasons, and met Nelson, a famous script writer and they now meet every year at the hotel for a rendezvous - this is the fourth year. Emails Nelson that she's in town and he says he has something to tell her. Meets next with her agent, Guy, who's lined up pitch meetings for her. During lunch, he gets a phone call from his lover (Guy's) telling him he's positive for AIDs. As the day goes on, Anne starts to lose her bad opinion of L.A., especially when offers for her script come in. During all this, she gets loving emails from her loving husband John who doesn't have a clue. Then, Nelson emails that he's left his wife and she takes it as a sign that he wants her, so she calls her husband and tells him about her affair. He loves her, is willing to forgive her, but she tells him it's over. What she doesn't know is that Nelson hasn't left his wife for Anne...but for another woman. Somewhat offbeat and quirky. Like it./YesKafkaesque in effect, the unreliable narrator of this piece proceeds from point to point to point in an escalating paranoia and misinterpretation of his environment, triggered by a disastrous \"date\" to the point of self-mutilation. Eventually, he bangs his own head on a regular basis with a hammer. I really like this one a lot./YesTwo old (Scottish) maids, Mary and Martha, live in a neighborhood that has become Hispanic. They play and sing old Scottish songs to each other. One night, two house burglars break in and steal their TV. One of the men strikes Mary when she won't tell him where the money is. His accomplish chastizes him and they leave. The two women go to the police station and when they come home, Mary realizes what they've become… two spinsters. She never sings again./NoWoman has a love affair with a man (Archie) and gradually falls out of love. She breaks it off by lying about another man. Good voice to the piece, but like lots of others./NoConstantly being compared (unfavorably) to the boy next door, Pauly comes to grips with his Jewishness and his family. This is terrific writing, brilliant in places. Highly recommend./Yes(One of three stories submitted)/Owen lives in an efficiency, is attracted to Gloria, a waitress, and takes care of his mother's finances (Mrs. Williams). Mrs. Williams is slipping into senility. His brother Robert is openly homosexual, which publically he finds okay, but privately is bothered by. Robert has AIDs. He dies before Owen can have a heart-to-heart talk with him and then his mother is hospitalized as she is dying./No(2nd story submitted)/Uncle Koji is a typewriter repairman in Tokyo who cannot find a job because of the emergence of computers and who loves to ride trains. As his unemployment lengthens, he begins riding trains and sitting near young girls, and progressively becomes bolder with them. He gets a job as a crowd control officer in a train station whose job is to push people into crowded cars. He loses his job when he doesn't honor the request of an attractive young girl to push her into the train, since he's realized his perversion. He ends up wearing the white gloves of his former office and frequenting train stations to help protect young girls against perverts such as he'd been./Another reader(3rd story)/le/Narrator comments on the plays of Gerald Hutch./NoNarrator's wife Laurel lies near death in a hospital bed. Receives various visitors, ponders his wife's life of alcoholism and as she dies he reconciles himself with her./NoKelly relates his life to a bartender who seems more interested in it than most readers would be./NoBlack man who commutes daily into New York considers his marriage, his life, his race. One day he discovers his train pass is missing, which becomes a metaphor for something missing in his own life. Well-written, but just not there yet./NoClark recounts his sexual progression from a boy to manhood, culminating in screwing his brother's wife. Good writing - should be encouraged./NoA race of miniature people live invisibly amongst us and who mirror our own behavior. Swiftian in nature./Another reader.Philosophical fable about a man who searches for knowledge and finds that things are not at all what they seem to be./Another reader.A recent graduate of high school looks for a summer job, ignoring her father's suggestion to try Norman's Ladies Apparel in favor of a health food restaurant. Marci also refuses to work in her father's diner. During the summer, she comes to achieve an empathy with her father's generation she didn't have before. Couple of small problems, but I like this one./Recommend\"Skippy\" is obsessed with his mother's obesity and he wavers between hetero- and homosexuality and finally seems to decide on homosexuality. Some really good writing here, but overall I kept feeling as if there was something missing./NoAfter an extramarital affair with Donna ends, the narrator has a bad experience with his wife Paula and her camcorder (this was fuzzy, as to what actually happened - too cryptic) and then Donna lets him know she's still available. Turns out there's a twist; Donna is actually in love with Vinnie who works in the same electronics store as they do. Paula gets obsessed with the camcorder, using it on every possible occasion. The narrator tries to sort out his relationships and finds out his wife has been videotaping him and Donna, but nothing seems to change. The writer doesn't seem to know what his story is here - too unfocused - although there are several good moments./NoA common fault and the reason most were rejected is that it was clear the submission was a first draft. With a good polish, more would have been publishable. Hope you find these somewhat interesting!Blue skies,LesGetting wired before my talk at the Writer's Institute at the University of Wisconsin last year...

Edgerton            Tension is the stuff of great stories. In fact, without tension, there is no story, at least in terms of literature. Tension is easy to explain, sometimes difficult to execute. It can also be called crisis or conflict. Without the element of tension, stories fall flat.            Consider this: Dick gets accepted to Harvard, graduates magna cum laude, lands a job in a top Wall Street investment firm. While there, he meets Gwen, a beautiful investment counselor. They begin to date and a year later marry. They have twins, a boy and girl who grow up to be wonderful children, earning top grades in school and eventually progress to adulthood, go to good schools, marry well and give their parents terrific grandchildren. Gwen and Dick never have a fight, invest wisely for both themselves and their clients, and become wealthy. Perfectly compatible, they read the same books, enjoy the same movies, and end up dying in their sleep together at the age of ninety-four. Their funeral is well-attended by the rich and famous, all whom have loved and adored the lucky couple.            A nice story... in real life... but a complete washout as a fictional story. Their story is interesting only to themselves and perhaps their friends and relatives, but to anyone else it is a major snooze.            Now, make Dick black and Gwen white and Dick has an enemy... and you have a story (Othello). Or, they have a great love for each other but Gwen’s married (Anna Karenina). Or, he loves her with everything he’s got but she only goes for him after he’s exhausted his passion (Gone With The Wind).            Mel McKee, an editor and teacher, tells his students that “a story is a war. It is sustained and immediate combat.” He gives four rules for writing a story.                        (1) Get your fighters fighting, (2) Have something --the stake-- worth their fighting over, (3) Have the fight dive into a series of battles with the last battle in the series the biggest and most dangerous of all, (4) Have a walking away from the fight.            A story is about a character wanting something intensely and there is an impediment to his or her goal. That’s it. Keep in mind, the thing the character wants need not be something huge and spectacular, but the character must want whatever it is with great intensity. In David Madden’s novel The Suicide’s Wife, the protagonist wants nothing more than to get her driver’s license, but she feels her identity and future depend on getting that license and a corrupt highway patrolman tries to manipulate her and because she wants her license so badly it becomes a terrific story.            A result of watching too many bad movies and TV series and reading too many potboiler melodramas, is that beginning writers sometimes feel that the best way to introduce drama into their fiction is by way of murders, airplane crashes, bank robbers and the lot, not realizing most roadblocks to desires in real life are much closer to home, in the form of our own personalities, bodies, friends and families and make for much better literature. More passion, says Janet Burroway in Writing Fiction, is destroyed at the breakfast table than in a time warp.            Kurt Vonnegut speaks about story tension in an interview in the Paris Review, when he says,                        When I used to teach creative writing, I would tell students to make their characters want something right away even if it’s only a glass of water. Characters paralyzed by the meaninglessness of modern life still have to drink water from time to time. One of my students wrote a story about a nun who got a piece of dental floss stuck between her lower left molars, and who couldn’t get it out all day long. I thought that was wonderful. The story dealt with issues a lot more important than dental floss, but what kept readers going was anxiety about when the dental floss would finally be removed. Nobody could read that story without fishing around in his mouth with a finger.            What we as writers want to do to our readers is keep them wondering and worrying. So long as they are doing that, they are turning the pages. The easiest (and perhaps best) way of doing this is by raising story questions at the very beginning. A story question is a device to make the reader curious. They aren’t put in question form, but are statements that require further explanation, problems that require resolution, forecasts of crisis, and the like (from James N. Frey, How to Write a Damn Good Novel). A knock on the door late at night. (Question: Who could be there?) Jim meets Nancy on the train. (Question: Will they like each other?) Betty didn’t believe in ESP. (Question: Will this disbelief be put to the test?)            These kinds of beginnings are very effective in creating tension in stories and they can be answered very quickly or they can be long-range story questions that won’t be answered until near the end of the story. Beware of story questions that don’t become fairly irrelevant to the story; the question must not only get the reader involved in the story, it should be justified by the story that follows. If it is a question that isn’t the main question of the story, it must logically lead to that question. A rule of thumb about story questions is that the further the distance between when the question was posed and when it was answered has to be reflected in the payoff. Short distance—small payoff. Long distance—large payoff.            Poor openings that are often used, are openings such as Frey describes in his book:·         Ginger’s bedroom had striped wallpaper on the walls and a desk under the window. (questions raised: none.).·         Ocean City was no place to have fun at night, so Oswald decided to go to bed early and read about how to make a paper airplane. )This is a negative story question; the reader doesn’t want to read on because he doesn’t want to be bored.).·         The old Ford had a rusted paint job and a horsehair seat that smelled like an old pair of sneakers. (Again, no question being raised-description only.).·         The warm sea breeze blew in through the open window and the moon overhead was a golden globe on the horizon of the Santa Cruz mountains. (Sounds like a fiction story all right, but it isn’t going to hook a reader.).            On the other hand, here are some examples of good opening questions:·         The cold passed reluctantly from the earth, and the retiring fogs revealed an army stretched out on the hills, resting. As the landscape changed from brown to green, the army awakened, and began to tremble with eagerness at the noise of rumors. (The Red Badge of Courage. Question: What are the rumors?)·         Someone must have traduced Joseph K., for without having done anything wrong, he was arrested one fine morning. (The Trial. All kinds of story questions are raised here. Why was he arrested? What will happen to him? Who turned him in and why?            To create anxiety in the reader, you must create a sympathetic character, one who most readers will want to see good things happen to. And then, throughout the story, the reader should be worrying about bad things that will happen to the character.            Tension is created by first creating story questions, putting the sympathetic character(s) in a situation of menace (to their goals), and lighting the fuse, thereby making the reader wonder and worry.            Keep in mind that sympathetic characters are not always wholesome characters--they can be the worst individuals on the face of the earth, but there must be something about them that the reader can identify with. That is what is meant by “sympathy” in the literary sense. In the novel, The Silence of the Lambs, Hannibal Lector is definitely not the traditional character that inspires sympathy in the common acceptance of the term (in the nonliterary sense), but he represents an intellectual strength and control over his emotions that many wish they had. This makes him sympathetic in literary meaning. The word sympathetic in literature doesn’t mean we have sympathy for him or her; it means there is something inherent in the character that we admire or desire for ourselves, in Lector’s case, intellectual strength. The fact that he is helping catch another serial killer is his redeeming feature that can allow us to identify with him as readers and keep turning the pages to see what happens.            Writing theorists divide conflicts into basic categories--man against man, man against nature, man against society, man against machine, man against God, man against himself, and most stories will fit one of those categories. This is all very nice but can be confusing to someone beginning a story. This is because a writer needs a specific story to tell. If he or she sits down to pit “man against nature” he will have less of a story than if he pits fourteen-year-old Corey John against a one hundred and twenty pound tarpon in the Gulf of Mexico.            Once you have established tension with your story question, you must keep it going. And escalating to a final act of epiphany in which the main character is changed forever. James Joyce is responsible for developing this idea on which most modern short stories are based. In the twentieth and twenty-first centuries, the true territory of struggle is internal, in the main character’s mind and therefore the real crisis action must occur there. (Read this again and then say it aloud. This is the definition of a contemporary short story.)            Janet Burroway gives a good example of such a story when she gives us a story outline about two brothers on a fishing trip who struggle with each other. The protagonist, for most of the story, holds his older brother in contempt, only to discover at the end of the story that they are really bound together by love and family history. This is a clear epiphany, a mental reversal. An immature writer might mistakenly signal this change in a section whereby “suddenly Larry remembered their father and realized that Jeff was very much like him.” Doesn’t work. Why? Because even though the realization is internal, it must be manifested in an action so the reader is able to share the experience and thereby be moved with the character. The way it should be portrayed is--Jeff reached for the old net and neatly bagged the trout, swinging round to offer it with a triumphant, ‘Got it! We got it, didn’t we?” The trout flipped and struggled, giving off a smell of weed and water and fecund mud. Jeff’s knuckles were lined with grime. The knuckles and the rich river smell filled him with a memory of their first fishing trip together, the sight of their father’s hands on the same scarred net...            Here is a memory, leading to a realization, and it was triggered by an action and sensory details the reader can share. Do you see the difference? There has to be a physical action that leads to the moment of realization that is what makes story... story.            Another technique to avoid like the plague, is the “John Wayne rescue”. This was the hallmark of many bad Westerns and other movies and poorly-written stories. This occurs when the wagon train is circled by Indians and all appears lost...and out of nowhere the cavalry appears to rescue them. Don’t do this! This is just simply bad writing. The ability to resolve a conflict must come from within and it should be foreshadowed, not foisted as a complete surprise on the reader as something completely foreign to the situation. Also, don’t use this technique (John Wayne rescues) to further the action. There is an awful movie that every now and then makes it rounds on late-night television you may have seen that illustrates this. (Just shows you Hollywood will put out anything)            I forget the name of the movie, but the plot line is based on a man and woman being trapped inside a new-fangled, high-security office building they can’t get out of until Monday morning. I also don’t remember why, but a thug is chasing them around the building trying to kill them. They’re out on ledges, running down stairwells, etc. Lots of grubby, stereotypical \"action\" of the lowest rank. At one point, about midway through the movie, the man and woman somehow miraculously get the drop on the bad guy and knock him out with a staple gun. At this point, the movie fails, because they drop the staple gun and leave the unconscious villain and begin running again. This is a grave insult to the viewer’s intelligence. In a life and death situation like this, anyone with any brains at all, would either finish the bad guy off or if they have moral qualms about killing, would stay with him and every time he came to they’d knock him out again. Or tie him up or something. But no, these geniuses elect to start running again. They’re so dumb as characters you want the bad guy to whack them out just for their stupidity. This bit was written into the story just to advance the plot and keep the action going. It’s a trick and any intelligent viewer is going to switch the dial off at this point or walk out of the theater, assuming that they value their time and don’t wish to waste it on movies for the terminably brain-dead. Whenever you get to a place in the story where basic common sense dictates one course of action and you, as writer, have the characters take another (let’s call it an “idiot” course), just to advance the story, then the story is doomed. So beware.            In today’s world, good fiction echoes life itself in that there are no clear or permanent solutions, that the conflicts of character, relationships and the universe can’t be permanently resolved. There are no more “and they lived happily ever after” kinds of stories, at least ones that anyone would want to read. But the story form demands a resolution of some sort. Take a war story, for example. After the initial skirmish, after the guerrillas, after the air strike, after the poison gas and the nuclear bomb, two survivors emerge from a shelter. They crawl, then stumble to the fence that marks the border. Each grasps the barbed wire with a bloodied fist. The “resolution” of this battle is that no one will ever win. There will never be a resolution, and this epiphany leads the reader to realize a change has been effected from the opening scene in which it seemed worthwhile to initiate a skirmish. In the opening question of conflict was contained the possibility that one side or the other would win; in the resolution of the story it is clear that no one can ever win. (From Janet Burroway’s Writing Fiction)            To sum up, one effective way tension is created is from the onset by use of a “story question”. (Created by the inciting incident - will (s)he resolve the problem?) It is then escalated by a series of incidents in which the protagonist tries to resolve the question, until when all else has failed, there is one last scene in which by his or her own initiative, and triggered by an action, the question is resolved, for bad or good. Out of this must come a change in the situation from whence he or she began, a shift in the main character’s thinking, belief, or take on life.

I won’t name the student, but just to let you know, she is a wonderful writer with a rare, original and very compelling voice. She’s already a very good writer and is going to emerge as one who can deliver the kinds of novels that are publishable. Like many beginning writers, she’s struggling a bit with inciting incidents, but with each rewrite she gets closer and closer. The response below is to her second submission in class.(This is almost word for word the comments I provided for her work. I’ve deleted her name as well as the names of her characters. She had much better names for her characters...)(Student’s name deleted), again your writing itself is wonderful. A great, original voice, infused with self-depreciating humor that will win you lots of readers. But… again, there’s no problem here simply because there’s no inciting incident in sight. What you listed as a new inciting incident just isn’t for the reasons given.The problem is that there are two important elements involved in publishable work. One is a compelling voice. The other is that the structure corresponds to what we accept as story. You’ve got the first one… in spades. Now, you need to work on the second—the structure. Which means you need to begin with an inciting incident that will reveal a story problem. A story problem isn’t a bad situation or a bad feeling about oneself. It has to be a compelling problem that the reader will buy as compelling and want to see how the protagonist resolves it.Okay. Here’s what I think is happening with your story. It looks as though Janine has a problem with her weight and her self-image of herself. That’s a potentially powerful story problem to have. The problem is you’re not beginning with the incident that reveals that problem to her properly. Let’s compare your story to Thelma & Louise, because, in story structure terms, you have much the same story.First, it appears evident that being overweight is a condition Janine has had for some time. Perhaps most of her life, even. That means it’s not yet a story problem. At this point, it’s merely a bad situation. In real life, yeah, it’s sad and all that, but it’s not yet the stuff of stories. What has to happen to raise it to that level is for something to happen to her (an inciting incident) that raises it beyond the level of a bad situation and reveals to her that she’s got a problem that she can no longer ignore for even brief periods of time (as it looks like she has before), but has to, from that point forward, devote all of her energies, her every thought, to resolving it. That’s what the inciting incident accomplishes.The thing your story has in common with T&L is that Thelma’s situation (backstory) is that she’s been in a bad relationship with Darryl for eight years. Your character has been overweight for a lengthy amount of time as well (also backstory). Thelma is fairly aware that her marriage sucks and she’s treated like a vassal, but for eight years it’s only been a bad situation. As is Janine’s situation—she’s been overweight for a long time and is aware of it, but that’s only a bad situation. Not yet the stuff of story. Thelma also has been fully aware she’s in a bad situation, and, from time-to-time has performed actions to deal with it. She’s probably spit in Darryl’s food, gossiped and complained about him to Louise, not given her all in bed, whatever. Other times, she ignores her problem. Janine has probably also done things from time to time to address her weight problem—gone on diets, exercised, whatever. But, it’s not yet to the point where it becomes the biggest single problem in her life and at a stage where nothing can get in the way of her resolving it, any more than Thelma has before her inciting incident. That’s what’s required to raise it to the level of becoming a story. If she can still ignore it for a time, can alibi what her true state is for a time to herself, can even forget her problem for a time… then it’s not yet a story. It’s only when she reaches her tipping point, when that “straw that broke the camel’s back” moment occurs and reveals to her that it’s the single biggest problem in her life and that she can no longer ignore it, even briefly, that it becomes a story. In T&L, Thelma’s inciting incident is a small, dramatic moment. We’ve seen clearly via the phone conversations with Louise that it’s imperative Thelma ask Darryl for permission to go on the trip with her. She even begins to… twice. It’s the second time she starts to ask his permission that constitutes her inciting incident. It’s what Darryl does to her—remember?—the inciting incident is something that happens to the protagonist? What Darryl does, is something he’s no doubt done before, But—this time it’s different. This time it’s the one time too many that he’s done this. And what does he do? Simple. She attempts to ask him the second time for permission and he crudely and rudely dismisses her, treating her as an annoyance rather than as his wife and a person. It’s the tipping point for her, the inciting incident, the thing that finally reveals her problem clearly to her. (Keep in mind that the word “problem” in story terms doesn’t have the same definition as the lay term. In story terms, it’s more than a bad situation—it’s a problem that the protagonist won’t let go away until it’s resolved.)Here’s the actual scene:THELMA goes through the living room to the bottom of the stairs and leans on the banister.THELMA(hollering again)Darryl! Honey, you’d better hurry up.DARRYL comes trotting down the stairs. Polyester was made for this man and he’s dripping in “men’s” jewelry. He manages a Carpeteria.DARRYL(annoyed)Dammit, Thelma, don’t holler like that! Haven’t I told you I can’t stand it when you holler in the morning?THELMA(sweetly and coyly)I’m sorry, Doll, I just didn’t want you to be late.DARRYL is checking himself out in the hall mirror and it’s obvious he likes what he sees. He exudes confidence for reasons that never become apparent. He likes to think of himself as a real lady-killer. He is making imperceptible adjustments to his overmoused hair. THELMA watches approvingly.(My note. This was the setup. Now comes the inciting incident.)THELMA          Hon.DARRYL(still annoyed)What.THELMA(she decides not to tell him.)Have a good day at work today.DARRYL          Uh-huh.THELMAHon?DARRYL(as if he’s trying to concentrate.)What?!THELMA          You want anything special for dinner?And, that’s the inciting incident. For perhaps the hundredth time (or more!) in their relationship, she started to do what she’s always done in the past—ask for her husband’s permission to go on the trip. But… something’s different this time. With his evident attitude—his crude dismissal of her and of anything she’s trying to say—she reaches her limit. Before this point, she’s just put up with him and played the dutiful wife. This time, her problem is clearly revealed to her. The little light in the refrigerator of her mind just clicked on. This is why it’s important to understand the complete definition of the inciting incident. (The inciting incident is something that happens to the protagonist that creates and/or reveals the story problem to her.) If she has what appears to be a problem but it’s not clearly revealed to her that she has, then it’s not yet a problem in story terms. It has to be revealed and clearly to her. That’s the only thing in the definition that has to be there in the inciting incident scene. The problem—at least to others—may have been there for a long time or it may be created in the scene. That doesn't matter. What matters and is crucial is that it is revealed to her as a problem.  (As is Janine’s overweight problem in your story.) She may have even been very aware of a bad situation (in Thelma’s case, a vassal state in her relationship; in Janine’s case, her overweight condition.) But, until that moment when it reaches the level of being the most important problem in her life—a problem that she can’t ignore another minute until it’s resolved—it’s only a bad situation and not a story problem.The scene above--taken directly from the shooting script—would be written a bit differently as a scene in a novel. Remember, the only things that can be in a screenplay are what can be seen or heard.* A novel has an additional advantage—we can get inside the character’s mind.*(Not entirely true, as this script shows. Even though many screenwriting books tell us this—that the only things in a script are what can be seen and heard, the astute screenwriter also knows that someone important—a human being who can make a decision whether to buy it or not—will be reading it. So, even though you’re not supposed to put anything but visuals and aurals into a screenplay, a smart screenwriter also supplies little asides that make it a more entertaining read. In the portion of the script above, for instance, that’s represented by the “He exudes confidence for reasons that never become apparent. He likes to think of himself as a real lady-killer.” (This is his thought and technically shouldn't be in a screenplay) and the “wrylies” (sweetly and coyly) wouldn’t be there in a screenplay where the screenwriter followed all the so-called “rules” of screenwriting. But they would be if the writer was a smart writer and wanted to sell the script…The same scene written as a scene in a novel would show Thelma’s thoughts when Darryl dismisses her. In a film, that has to be shown.In a movie, we “get” what’s just happened by seeing it. In T&L we “see” the little “click” that goes on in Thelma’s eyes, and, almost immediately afterward, we see her first action to resolve the problem. Her action? She doesn’t ask for permission. That’s it. The entire story that follows emanates directly from this inciting incident. If she’d asked for permission, he would have denied her. It’s their history. (As a note, many people think the inciting incident is when Louise shoots Thelma’s would-be rapist. Not at all. That’s simply the “point of no return.” They wouldn’t have even arrived at the rape attempt and shooting scene if Thelma had asked Darryl’s permission.The surface problem evolves and mutates and changes, but it has to begin with the inciting incident. This is what you must have in your story.There are two things you can do to make what you have here work, (student's name). One, rewrite your inciting incident statement so that it is an inciting incident. Second, write that scene. Actually, you can use what you’ve begun here. One possibility is to have them go to the beach, spread the blanket, unpack the basket, etc. and then change the last two lines of what you have here. Like this:“I hope you don’t mind that we have a picnic,” he says. “A…” he hesitates, “…healthy picnic.” He shines me a weak smile.And then, show us her reaction via her thoughts and actions. Like this, perhaps:            I could only stare at him. So this was where my life had led me. Go on a weight-watcher’s picnic, eat some carrot sticks… and get my marriage proposal.            Wonderful. This has to rank as the most romantic moment of my life. Julia Roberts, eat your heart out.            “Sorry, Claude,” I say, once I can get my mouth to work. “Why don’t you take me back home. I think I left my carton of Chunky Chocolate out on the counter. I wouldn’t want it to melt.”And then go on to develop her understanding more deeply of her story problem. What’s at stake for her and give her second action to resolve it. Show the depths of her despair and make it a truly big deal to her, one that she’s not going to let go of until it’s resolved. In this example, her first action is to do what she just did. The above is a small, dramatic moment and it keeps with your self-depreciating and very likable voice for her and take on herself and life, yet clearly shows a realization of her problem. Something like this is going to get the reader solidly in her corner and want to see what she does.The other thing to watch is what you indicated might happen—that some Prince Charming does come along. That’s fine, but just make sure he comes along as a result of something she’s done to try to resolve her problem and not just appearing as an act of fate or coincidence.You’re not very far off from achieving a great opening, (student). Hope this helps!Blue skies,Les                                                               IIn my classroom... Well, it is online..."},

Let’s take a real-life example of how details convince others. Let’s assume there is a man, unemployed for six months, whose wife has been carping at him (justifiably) to get a job, but he hasn’t actually looked for months. However, he wants to convince her he’s trying his best to secure employment. On Monday, he has promised her he will go down to the unemployment office and see what they have. Monday evening, when she returns from her own job she asks him if he went as promised. It may go something like this:            “Did you go to the unemployment office today like you promised?” Mary asked, her eyebrows raising and her tone skeptical.            “Of course I did. I was there bright and early. They just didn’t have anything I was qualified for. At least I made the effort.”            “Right,” she said. “I believe you, Tony. I really do.” There was pure sarcasm in her voice. Leaving the room to go upstairs and change her work clothes, she spat out one word as she went up the stairs. “Liar!”            Now, this is a passable scene (barely) but the man doesn’t convince his wife and he certainly doesn’t convince the reader. Now, imagine the same situation but structured a little differently:            “Did you go to the unemployment office today like you promised?” Mary said, her tone skeptical.            “Yeah,” Tony said. “Not that it did much good. They didn’t have a single job I was qualified for. Something weird happened, though. There was a lady just in front of me in line and she was nine months pregnant. Just as she got to the window, she started screaming and yelling and collapsed to the floor. People came running from everywhere and somebody called 911 and guess what! She had her damn baby right there! I couldn’t believe it! It was a boy. She was wearing this blue dress and when the blood got on it, it was the weirdest thing. Instead of turning it red, it turned it black. Anyway, it screwed everything up. I bet it was another half hour before they all settled down and I got to see a clerk. Not that it did any good. You’da thought maybe that would have brought me good luck, since I got to jump a place in line, but there wasn’t even one single, solitary job I could do. Unless I lied and told them I could handle heavy equipment. I thought about even doing that--lie--but I knew they’d figure it out as soon as I crawled up on that caterpillar seat that I didn’t know what the hell I was doing. How was your day? A little less traumatic, I hope?”            See the difference? In the first example, whether Tony was speaking the truth or not it didn’t matter - Mary didn’t believe him and we don’t either. In the second example, by use of detail to embellish his story, it would be difficult not to believe Tony. There’s a pregnant lady - she’s the one in front of him - she’s wearing a blue dress that turns black where the blood spotted it - and so on and so on. By the use of details, he has turned a weak lie into a story that would be hard to disbelieve.            Tony also used something else to suspend his wife’s disbelief. He used tension. What could have been a tenser situation than what he was describing! Tension keeps the reader turning the pages and overlooking the fact he or she knew when beginning the story - that it was fiction and therefore a lie.            James Frey, in his book How To Write A Damn Good Novel, II informs that the fictive dream is created by the power of suggestion. He goes on to say that “the power of suggestion is the operant tool of the ad man, the con man, the propagandist, the priest, the hypnotist, and, yes, the fiction writer.” That’s exactly what we are doing when we write fiction--we’re running a con game. We’re lying to readers. The trick is to get them (the reader) to believe the lie.            Besides the use of details and creating tension, the writer must provide for the reader an emotional involvement. This is done by creating sympathy, identification, and empathy for the protagonist. Once we care, on some level, about the character the story is about, we will suspend our disbelief and keep on reading.            Sympathy for a character is created in a number of ways. Sympathy does not necessarily mean admiration, which Frey points out. He offers the character of Jake LaMotta in the film Raging Bull for an example. LaMotta beats his wife, seduces underage girls, has a horrible temper, suffers from paranoia and speaks in grunts. He is a total savage. Yet the LaMotta character in the movie gets enormous audience sympathy. Why? Because, at the start of the movie, LaMotta is living in ignorance, degradation and poverty and so the audience feels sorry for him, and therefore will follow him on the screen through his story, regardless of the fact that he is a brutish lout in almost all respects.            Sympathy is how a reader gains emotional access to a story and without it there is no involvement and the reader will put down the book or story.            Second, the reader must identify with the character. This happens when the reader is not only sympathetic with the character’s situation but also applauds his or her goals and wants the character to achieve them. Frey again gives some very good examples:            In Jaws, the reader supports Brody’s goal to destroy the shark.            In The Red Badge of Courage, the reader supports Henry’s desire to prove to himself he isn’t a coward.            In Gone With The Wind, the reader supports Scarlett’s desire to get her plantation back after it is destroyed by Yankees. (I can relate to that, being a Southerner!)            The way to achieve identification is to give the main character goals and desires that the reader will view as desirable him- or herself.            The third technique in achieving emotional involvement for the reader is empathy. Empathy is an even more powerful emotion than sympathy. A husband suffering birth pains along with his wife is an example of empathy. Empathy is simply the reader putting himself in the shoes of the character. One way to do this is to use the power of suggestion. Use details to suggest what it is like to be the character and experience what he or she is experiencing. Using my own story “My Idea of a Good Thing” in Monday's Meal, Raye is not a particularly admirable character--she’s addicted to alcohol, for example. It would have created little empathy if I had just drawn her as this weak-willed person who just can’t say no to a drink--but when you show the reader what her struggle is like, then most people can identify with her on some level and will then gain empathy. For instance, most people aren’t alcoholics, but most of us have fallen prey to some form of addiction. Maybe it’s cigarettes, maybe it’s chocolates, maybe it’s always falling for the wrong man or woman. There are lots of examples. By using details of the internal struggle, the reader can identify with their own private struggles. Reaching for a bottle of Stoli may evoke images within the reader of reaching for the pack of Marlboros or that pint of Haagen-Daz Chocolate-Chocolate Chip in the supermarket.            Once you have established sympathy, identification and empathy for your character, you’ve created a strong emotional bond between that character and the readers. One final step is needed to bring the reader into that hypnotic state of suspended disbelief, called the plenary state in hypnosis. We are striving for the same effect.            Inner conflict.            This is the key to transporting the reader. It’s the storm that rages inside the characters heart, mind and soul. In literary fiction we have an advantage over media like film in showing inner conflict. In films this conflict can be shown only in exterior ways. In the written word and in plays, we have more tools since we can actually go into the character’s minds and we can use dialogue more abundantly than one can in movies. Too much dialogue in movies usually results in a kind of “talking heads” kind of production, but entire books have been successfully written almost entirely in dialogue. And what is a stage play without dialogue!            To create inner conflict we need to show the character’s guilt, doubts, misgivings and remorse and we need to show the character struggling with decisions. There have to be decisions to be made to achieve the goal of the character and they can’t be easy decisions. Nothing that is black and white. The best literature is shaded gray. There should be pros and cons to each decision on the way to goal-achievement, and whatever is gained should be with some loss. Scarlett O’Hara, for example, ultimately gains her beloved Tara, but at the cost of two men who loved her and for whom she had love, albeit with bad timing. She gains the thing that is most important to her but in the process loses something almost equally valuable. This is the stuff of literature.            Frey again gives an excellent way to think of inner conflict. He suggests thinking of it as a battle between two voices within the character: one of reason, the other of passion--or of two conflicting passions. Within the character him or herself rages a protagonist and an antagonist.            Again, using my own story, Raye has a voice inside telling her she must stop drinking or die and another voice convincing her that if she does quit the booze, she will lose her soul or at least that which makes her an artist and therefore human. Which is preferable? To live physically and die emotionally or to do the reverse? In a perfect, happy-ending, fairy-tale kind of story, she could have both. She could dry out and find she plays even better than before, but that isn’t real life (at least not Raye’s “real life”).Try this: Pick a story you especially like (you can use the one you’re writing now, if you choose), and see if you can pick out how the author has created sympathy, identification and empathy for the main character. Then, identify the internal crisis in the protagonist’s mind. This is only for your own use - not to be shared with the rest of us and is designed to have you look at stories in their bare essence. Basically, you will be looking for what the character wants and why did you (reader) care enough to keep reading to see if the goal was achieved.            It's important that the author create this in the beginning of her story - empathy, sympathy and/or identification for the central character. Else why should the reader continue?            Answer: He/She won't…"},

Edgerton Hi folks,Thought it was time for some \"writer\" stuff. Short stories originate from many sources. Sometimes they evolve from a character, something he or she says or does. A scrap of conversation overheard. Sometimes from playing the game “what if,” where the writer takes a situation she is familiar with and asks herself “what if” the incident took a different turn. Other times a word will be the seed that leads to a completed story. My first novel began in such a way, with the word spatterdashers. I saw the word used in a Paris Review interview and became intrigued with it, eventually using it for a metaphor throughout the book. Originally, it was the title although the publisher changed it for publication to The Death of Tarpons. Actually, we had a bit of an argument over this. She claimed that she didn’t know what the word meant until I explained it (it was the original form of the word that’s been shortened over the years from usage to “spats” meaning an article of clothing men wore to “prevent spatter from dashing their trousers.”). I (reluctantly) agreed, and then, shortly after my novel came out, another novel came out titled Palimpsest by Gore Vidal. She pointed out that he was Gore Vidal… and I wasn’t… and I refrained from mentioning that as an editor she should have known what that term meant and she didn’t. She won, I lost… Some stories are almost exact representations of an actual event, changed only slightly to meet the requirements of fiction writing. There are many more sources for story ideas, almost as many as there are stories! Ideas are everywhere; indeed, the problem with most of us is insufficient time to develop all the story ideas rattling around in our brain pans!Choose your story premise carefully, making it one you will feel comfortable staying the course with until the short story or novel is completed.A premise is a simple thing, but the tool by which most good stories are created. As author James Frey explains in his text, How to Write a Damn Good Novel, II, “A premise is a statement of what happens to the characters as a result of the actions of the story. That’s it, nothing more. It isn’t the plot. The plot is basically the causal actions of the story. In the premise is included, as Lajos Egri says in The Art of Dramatic Writing, “character, conflict and conclusionFirst let’s look at what a premise isn’t. It isn’t a moral. It isn’t stated as something like “Obey the Ten Commandments or Else!”. It isn’t a theme. A theme is a recurring fictional idea, expressed as things like “true love,” “duty to country,” stuff like that. A wonderful example of a premise, on the other hand, is the one expressed in the well-known story of The Three Little Pigs. That story’s premise could be stated as: Foolishness leads to death and wisdom leads to happiness. That’s it. By the way, most of these examples are taken from James Frey’s book, an excellent guide for writers. He gives another great example of a premise in the Bible story of Samson and Delilah--the premise of that tale being that Repentance leads to a glorious death. As Frey explains, the Samson story’s premise is really stating that: God’s love leads to great strength, which leads to heroism in battle, which leads to haughtiness and arrogance, which leads to temptations of the flesh, which leads to betrayal, which leads to defeat and disgrace and blindness, which lead to repentance, which leads to a restoration of superpowers, which leads to a glorious death. The premise, as stated above as “Repentance leads to a glorious death,” is just a shorthand way of saying all of that. A premise says that through a causal chain of events, one situation will lead to another and will eventually lead to a resolution. It’s merely a way of saying what the chain of events is that leads the character(s) through conflict to the conclusion. Keep in mind that a premise should be about a single aspect of human life, not multiple aspects. A short story doesn’t allow enough room for more than one aspect ordinarily.The great thing about developing a premise early on in a story’s creation, is that you now have a frame to build your story on. Another nice thing is that if you have a premise, you can create a story out of nothing more than that. You have a roadmap to follow and when your mind takes side trips you can easily steer it back onto the main highway. Premise is one of the most powerful tools you have in your writer’s toolbox. A premise also is a useful tool once you begin editing your story. Anything that doesn’t follow the premise should be cut.Many times, writers will argue that the way they like to write is to create a character and then let them go. Let the characters write the story. The only problem with this is that many, many times the characters won’t write a very good story. They’re drifting, rudderless. You might end up with a good story using this method, but the odds are against it. Again, there is always the exception that proves the rule. I have to confess that when I write stories, in my beginning draft, there are times when I don’t have a clearly defined premise. But...when I sit down to begin rewrites I always have one, developed from what I’d written in my first draft. And, on those occasions when I don’t have a premise, I struggle more than any other time. Once I have a premise, I can begin easily to whack out the irrelevant portions, and begin to create what Flannery O’Connor called the “unified effect”. This is the one element all great stories have in common, and it is best achieved by guiding your story by the North Star called Premise.There are three kinds of premises. Chain reaction, opposing forces, and situational. Chain reaction premises are the easiest to understand. You have a character, something happens to him that sets off something else and so on, leading to a climax and resolution. Many of Raymond Carver’s short stories have chain reaction premises. Opposing forces premises are where two forces are set against each other and one wins. Good examples of these kinds of stories are many of Shakespeare’s plays, such as Romeo and Juliet and Robert Benchley’s Jaws. The final kind, situational, describes the kind of story in which a particular situation affects the character(s). Stephen Crane’s The Red Badge of Courage illustrates a situational kind of premise - a coward finds himself in the army during a time of war and strives to overcome his cowardice.Another mistake many writers (including this one) make, is confusing an amusing or interesting anecdote for a story. If you apply the theory of premise to this kind of material, it becomes clear instantly that what you have is not a story at all, not in the sense that we regard stories. (Especially publishable ones!)Let’s look at some examples of how to develop a premise from your story. Let’s say you have a protagonist named Mary who is an alcoholic. She has recently hit her “bottom” and realizes she needs help in overcoming her problem. She begins attending A.A. meetings and gets involved in a 12-step program. Things go along fairly smoothly until she meets a guy (Emory) at one of the meetings, becomes sexually interested in him and he asks her to go to a bar with him. Not to drink, he injects; just to talk and get out of the “institutional atmosphere” of the A.A. meeting. (The meetings are held in a hospital). While there, he confesses he’s a musician and has just signed a contract with a big recording company, but he feels he’s a charlatan in accepting their money; what they heard him play was technically perfect, but he was sober at the time and his music held no “soul”. His conflict is that he wants more to be a “real” musician, i.e., one with “soul” than one who is commercially successful. Therefore, he has just decided at that very moment to fall off the wagon and begin drinking. Mary, a musician herself, sees a kindred soul in Eddie, and goes home to wrestle with her own demon. Should she make the same decision as Emory, or is it more important to save her health and life? In the end, she sits in her apartment, staring at a tumblerful of whiskey she has poured. We don’t know if she will drink it or not, but we feel she will, from the way it is set up. What is the premise of this story? It could be stated this way: “Someone with a fatal weakness may fall prey to that weakness if she associates with those who cannot control their own failings, especially if they are similar in makeup.” By the way, the above is based on a short story in my collection, titled \"My Idea of a Nice Thing.\"Remember too, that a premise isn’t a “moral” and shouldn’t be stated as such.Does this give you a better idea how to “see” the premise in a story? If you still have difficulty in determining the premise of your story, read Chapter Four of Frey’s book if you like. It’s on my list of writing books on this site should you wish a convenient way to order it.Here’s a real-life analogy that may help, also. I was a hairdresser (my “day” job) for almost thirty years and my wife and I frequently had to train new stylists we'd hired. Cosmetology schools, in general, don’t do much in the way of teaching hair-cutting theory. The haircutting portion of their education usually consisted of teaching the “steps” in three or four haircuts. They are taught to follow steps 1 through 10 to achieve the cut they are learning, whether it be a version of a “layer” cut, a one-length cut or whatever. They are learning what we call “cookie-cutter” haircutting. Unless they pick up haircutting theories on their own--which some do--they are the ones we call the “born” haircutter--most of them have little but a faint idea of how the structure of the haircut provides the finished look. They don’t realize, in the main, that every haircut in the world is achieved from the various angles the hair is held and cut at. What we did in our salon is to try and teach an understanding of haircutting angles and their result when performed on various types of hair. Rather, we provided a system in which the stylist teaches herself. We asked each beginning stylist to pick out ten styles a week in a fashion magazine and to diagram the angles used to achieve that style. In other words, we asked them to articulate the “premise” for that hairstyle. Very quickly, the stylist began to understand the structure and in short order could then cut any style she sees or visualizes. She became an artist, not merely a cookie-cutter automation. This is different from many hairstylists, who progress by adding to their repertoire by learning the “steps” in each style. For instance, such a stylist, if she has lasted long enough in the trade, begins to put “Cut #13” on this person, “Cut #6B” on another client. Such a stylist has learned the mechanical steps required for a variety of cuts, but hasn’t a clue as to how these steps came about. She’s not an artist yet, and if she continues her haircutting education in this manner probably never will. (I think a lot of architects and other \"design folk\" fall into this category!) She can put out a serviceable style on most folks, but will never become an innovator, creating styles of her own. On the other hand, the stylist who actually learns the theory of angles and observes what cutting various types of hair at different angles achieves, is on her way to becoming a successful stylist. Once she is well-versed in angle theory, she can then begin to experiment with angles, thereby creating unique styles, at which point she can begin realistically planning nice vacations and deciding which toney restaurant she wants to dine in that evening.Story writing is much the same process. There are many who perfect the craft of writing stories, but their product is bland and insipid and doesn’t breathe the life of greatness. In fact, the only reason their stories make it into print occasionally, is that they are technically perfect. It is a fact of reality that the way many editors select stories to be published is that they go through the stack of manuscripts awaiting them and look for reasons to reject them. This list can consist of dozens of things, from improper submission format, failure to enclose an SASE, to a misspelled word or the improper change of point of view of the narrator. When this kind of editor happens upon a manuscript that is technically “perfect”, i.e., all of the “rules” have been followed, sometimes this is the story they select. If your aim is merely to get published, learn all of the so-called rules and once in awhile you’ll see a story of yours get into print. However, if your aim is not only being published but in the creation of memorable stories, learning how to develop a premise will be of great value to you. Once you understand the concept of a premise and use it diligently in your work, you will begin to achieve what Flannery O’Connor called “a unified effect” and your work will begin to assume the kind of power all truly great stories have in common.Harking back to the example of the beginning hairdresser asked to diagram hairstyle angles, here’s an exercise that you can use to sharpen your own skills at developing premises. From now on, whenever you finish reading a short story or a novel, write down what you believe to be its premise. Once you’ve done that a few times, you’ll be surprised at how easy it is to do and you’ll find it remarkably easy to apply premises to your own work. In fact, it will become impossible to read a story thereafter without seeing its premise (or lack of one!). At first, don’t be too critical that you’ve gotten it exactly right. With but a little practice, you’ll begin to zero in on what the author intended, quicker in better stories. In fact, I’ll make a little bet, in that when you start to look for the premise in stories, the fiction you’ve judged as not that good are the stories that have a fuzzy premise or that wander from it. In quality stories, the premise is usually sharp and in focus. That’s because that writer understands the power of this tool and everything in her story that doesn’t contribute to the premise of the story ends up on the cutting room floor where it belongs.And plot? How does plot figure into this? Well, all plot is, is a summary of activity within the story. This happens, which causes this to happen, which causes this to...and so on. My own opinion of plot is that it’s hugely overrated. There are supposedly only five (six? seven?) plots in existance and it would be difficult to find more than that. You can use plot to discover your premise by simply loosely outlining what is going to happen in the story. For example: Protagonist comes to realization she’s got a drinking problem, goes to AA meeting, meets another alcoholic who’s a musician like herself, witnesses him fall off the wagon to achieve his art, comes to a crossroad herself by pondering his example. That’s a pretty basic plot and the one I used in the aforementioned story. The premise, I’ve already stated. The problem with plot is that other ideas occur as you’re writing your story and pretty soon you’ve taken a side road away from your original plot and end up abandoning the story. If you’ve developed a premise and a detour presents itself, so long as you don’t vary from the premise the story will complete itself. Some of this I have to ask you to take on faith. As the old joke goes - “Trust me!”Try to develop a premise for your story in one or two sentences or a paragraph. If you have already come up with a complete story idea, this shouldn’t be too hard, and if you haven’t, it may be even easier. Develop a premise on an idea that intrigues you, one that contains all the ingredients--character, conflict, and conclusion. Perhaps you’ve always been interested in the effect of opposites in relationships. Your premise might be “Given a potentially threatening personal disaster, a conservative husband takes the part of his liberal-thinking wife and makes an uncharacteristic decision, one that is personally harmful to his ego, but which proves his love for his wife.” Can you see the possibilities that articulating a premise gives a writer? You could further edit this premise down to something like, “To achieve true love, a man (or woman) has to suffer, as well as overcome personal biases.”Once you have a premise, writing the story becomes much easier and will stay on track to its final destination.Hope this helps!Blue skies,LesTThis is me, cutting my daughter Britney's hair.

I’m soooooo excited! This material was published a few years ago, but the government seized it and deemed it classified material and restricted it to a rare few who possessed the proper clearance, which is “Over the Top, Pinky-Swear, In the Stratosphere Top, Top, Really-Top Secret.” Only lit professors who specialize in the works of Samuel Richardson and in particular, his novel, Pamela, or, Virtue Rewarded, have been deemed to have the proper clearance and credentials to view this revealing document. Even then, they have to demonstrate they know the gang signal and the secret handshake to gain access to it.I had to petition the government under the Freedom of Information Act for its release, and it was only because I did the smart thing of hand-delivering my appeal on a Sunday, when all of the bureaucrats were out of the office, attending the annual Capitol Office Worker’s Bingo and Lobbyist’s Picnic, held on the pastoral grounds of the Watergate Hotel, and luckily, a janitor was there, dusting their awards for going over budget, and I was able to convince him to locate the necessary rubber stamp.For those writers who have read all the writer’s how-tos, attended all the writer’s conferences, logged onto all the boring writer’s blogs (except this one, natch!), and all the agent’s blogs and websites, in hopes of discovering the secret to publication—this is the only source you’ll ever need to learn the inside secret of getting your book published. What follows is the document, with a few spots marked out as per the government’s usual deletion of especially sensitive material, still considered classified.This is dedicated to you!Without further ado, I present:THE SECRET OF GETTING PUBLISHEDThere are only three rules to guaranteeing your opus will get published.

They wonder what an ugly guy like me sees in a beautiful woman like her. We’re kind of the “Lyle Lovett-Julia Roberts” of our set. I’ve tried to figure it out myself and the best I can come up with is… a case of extreme nearsightedness on her part.It’s like how we met. We were both sitting there, minding our beeswax, in the reception area of the Witness Protection Program office, sitting on their plush faux-Corinthian leather couch. Waiting to be called in to get our new identities and we struck up a conversation. Just idle chit-chat, like where are you from, what’s your major, what was your crime, what’s your sign.I never did find out exactly what Mary had done to earn entrance into this prestigious program, but I know it had something to do with large numbers of sheep and Black & Decker power tools. Once I knew that much, I decided not to press her for details. She might have told me.All I know is she never wears wool.The only other clue I have to her past existence is that whenever we go to church, she has to find a seat with her back to a wall. I do the same thing in bars, so it gives me a pretty good idea what kind of environment she came from.I think what attracted her to me was my sense of humor.Like the time we moved into a new neighborhood and I told all the neighborhood kids that Mary had been in a horrible, disfiguring accident and as a result she had a steel plate in her head, a wooden leg, and a glass eye. “No!” they said, about the glass eye, and then I bet them that if they could guess which eye was the fake one, I’d give them a dollar. “She’s been bugging me for a new one,” I told them, “but those suckers cost about eight grand. I don’t think anyone can tell it’s glass.”“We can’t drive near junkyards,” I also informed them. “Because of that darned steel plate in her head. Those big magnets they have will just suck her out of the car window. Fwoop! and she’s gone.”After I challenged them to figure out which was her glass eye, all of them came back and told me it was the left eye and I kept my word and paid them each a buck. A few minutes later, I heard a loud shriek and saw Mary crumple to the ground on the far side of the yard. Turns out one of the little rascals believed me about her wooden leg and decided to check it out for himself and had launched his field goal kicking technique on it. “Wrong one,” I told him, and: “If you like those pricey chicklets in your mouth you better run for home. She gets up, you’ll be sucking your steak out of a straw.” The wannabe-football player ran away on sturdy eight-year-old legs, yelling for his mama. After Mary calmed down and rubbed the cleat marks on her non-wooden leg, she saw the humor in it, and she was even laughing out loud when she told me I’d be allowed to spend the night on the couch and not have to go to a motel. “Don’t even try to sneak upstairs,” she said. “I’ve put my gun under my pillow with a full clip and one in the chamber.” She’s a riot!Good times!Or, the time we went to the mall with our boy Mike and Mike and I played our dressing room game. It’s where one of us goes into a dressing room in a clothing store and the other one waits outside until some shoppers wander by, and gives the signal, usually a series of coughs. The one in the dressing room then yells out, “There’s no damn toilet paper in here!” Mike and I love doing this as often as we can. The first time we did that when Mary was along, she didn’t grasp the humor of it, but later, when we were retelling it to friends, I saw her smile.We have some zany times at our house! Like one time, when Mike was six and he was laying in our bed with Mary, just bonding with his mom. He was watching an X-rated movie on TV and she was reading. I walked in and just stood there at the foot of the bed, and when they both looked up, I said in complete somberness, “Mike, there’s something I have to tell you. Your mom and I have talked about this for years and can never figure out how to break this to you, but you just keep getting older and time slips away more and more, and I’m just going to tell you.”I paused and swallowed hard.“Mike,” I said. “You were adopted.”Well, his jaw dropped and his eyes bugged out. I waited a few seconds and then said, “But they brought you back.”Humor is all over our house! In every corner!When Mary and I first started dating, I didn’t have a car. It blew up in the incident that got me into the Witness Protection Program and due to what I was told was a budget crunch, they didn’t spring for a new one. So, Mary drove.When she picked me up, I asked her to just cruise a few feet in front of me so I could chase the car for a block or so. It was part of the exercise regimen I was on to lose a few pounds.Well, with her fine-tuned sense of humor, she turned that on me. Whenever we’re out and I say something she takes exception to, she just turns to me and says, “Lie down by your dish.”“That’s not mean,” she explains to the others. “When we first started dating, Les would chase the car. And then, he always wanted to hang his head out the window and feel the wind on his face. He understands about the dish thing.”This next one is a true story. Not that the above stories aren’t true; this is just truer. When we were dating, I kept thinking she’s the one, but I wasn’t quite sure. So I decided to give her the “test.” It was mid-December and I took her to a movie in the Northcrest Shopping Center. It was a popular movie and there was a long line which we slipped into. About half way to the ticket booth, I performed the test to see if she was worthy. What’d I do?I cut a fart. A very loud one. Immediately after it cleared my buns, I turned to her and said, “I’ll take the blame for that.”She didn’t say a word. Just turned and walked toward the door.She passed! She handled it! I knew then she was the girl for me.We’ve had a great run. Lately, though, she’s been doing something I don’t quite understand. Lately, at night, just before I drop off to sleep, she gives me a gentle kiss on my forehead and just as my peepers are starting to close, she whispers in a barely audible voice:“Go toward the light.”What the heck does that mean?mMary and Matt C., a friend of ours at the Writer's Institute at the University of Wisconsin. She's just told me to lie down by my dish."},

All credit for these ideas goes to him!I’m convinced this is at the heart of many unfinished novels and short stories.What does the term mean? It’s that germ of an idea for a story triggered by any number of stimuli. It can be a glimpse of something—the “smell of the rain on the road at dawn” for instance. Driving home from a night of partying, hung over, you turn onto a country blacktop and see a man hitchhiking in Army fatigues in the fine mist that’s falling. Aha! There’s a story about this guy, you think. You begin to imagine a character who’s passing through town—and you kind of visualize a story about him. If you’re David Morrell, you end up with a story titled, First Blood.Or, you hear a story about a man whose mother has just died and the police came to inform him and they’re put off by his seeming lack of emotion about the tragedy and become suspicious. If you’re Albert Camus, perhaps you write a story based on that anecdote you’ll title, The Stranger.All of us as writers get ideas triggered like this and any number of other ways. Thinking about the scene or idea makes us feel that there’s a story there. Usually, when we see or conceive of a story idea that way, it elicits a powerful emotion from us. The guy in our vision, standing on the road at dawn in a drizzle, wearing fatigues, triggers a feeling of sadness, say. We have an urge to write this guy’s story so that the reader will feel this same intense feeling of sadness as we do.And so, we break out the Bic, turn on the ‘puter, put a piece of white paper in the Underwood and begin to write. And it fizzles out.Why? As Blake Snyder says, we’ve simply fallen in love with an inspiration. That’s all it is. There’s no story there yet mostly because we haven’t yet come up with a story. All we’ve got is a guy standing in the rain on a blacktop and a feeling that this is a story. It’s gossamer. It’s not a story because we haven’t taken the time to think beyond this image very much.I’ve got a student in a class I’m teaching at present who I think is at this stage. He’s an extremely gifted writer, but the story he’s worked on for a long time now isn’t working. I suspect it’s because he hasn’t yet thought out a story. He has an idea for a story, but ideas aren’t stories. There are infinite numbers of story ideas floating around and most of them will never become stories because they never progress beyond that stage. That image of that road.I don’t think this man will mind if I use his story as an example. I’m not going to name him and only the other students will know who he is should they read this, and he’s a very confident writer—as he should be—totally without ego and with a ton of talent, approaching brilliance, so I don’t think he’ll mind at all.His image of THE SMELL OF THE RAIN ON THE ROAD AT DAWN is of a young man, who upon the occasion of his twenty-first birthday discovers he’s been adopted. I don’t know if this is an image he’s gained from a  real-life event or just one he’s imagined, but it doesn’t matter.A powerful image. One that lends itself to all kinds of dramatic possibilities. However, I don’t believe our writer hasn’t thought much beyond how that will translate into a story. Is there a story there? Well, sure. I just don’t think he’s thought what that story will be. He’s been inspired by a glimpse at a dramatic moment in a life and senses there’s a story there. The problem is, he needs to find 400 pages of material to tell this story in, and I don’t think he has more than ten pages at most at this point. He hasn’t thought much beyond the guy finding out about the lie his adoptive parents have told him all of his life and his first reaction—getting drunk and/or getting into a fight. I suspect he hasn’t gone much beyond that in his mind, other than some vague idea of going through some kind of murky struggle to resolve his problem. In fact, when he began this story in class, he admitted this was the case, when he told me it “was a work in progress and changes on a daily basis” and that he’d “only started this a few weeks ago” and “was still trying to write his way into it, if that makes sense.” As I told him; no, it doesn’t make sense. He’s posing himself an almost impossible task to try to fill the 350-400 pages a novel requires with no more than this.This is a story doomed to failure, I’m afraid. And, I think it’s a very apt illustration of what happens to most of us when we begin a story with only “The smell of the rain…” image in our minds. The story peters out. We think up one, maybe two things that our protagonist will go through, and then our imaginations dry up. What usually happens is that at this point, another story idea presents itself and in much the same way as this one did, and we’re off in pursuit of that one, planning someday to return to the original one. Before we know it, we have a dozen unfinished novels sitting in our file cabinet.The problem is, the image we begin with is so powerful to us that we think that building a story around it will be easy. It is… for about three or four pages into a short story and perhaps ten-twelve pages into a novel. Sometimes, we can even get as far as 70-80 pages of a novel completed before we run out of steam. What’s happened is as Snyder says, “That flash of scent, sight, and sound makes us think we’re onto something.” We may be… but not yet. What we need to do is to take that image into a work that makes sense to others.That means… hard work.I suspect many of us who write are looking for easy answers. Secrets. Here’s a writing secret: There are no secrets. It’s hard work. If it was easy to write well, subsidy and vanity presses wouldn’t have any business. That’s the only easy way there is to achieve print. All it takes is a checkbook… and no pride. Or a misguided sense of what constitutes quality writing.First, that image you have is basically just the logline. You’re kind of putting the cart before the horse to begin a novel with just that. A short story can be tackled without nearly as much forethought as a novel, although I’d still recommend giving it some thought before putting pen to paper. But, a novel, in my opinion, requires a lot of planning and thought before sitting down in front of the computer to be successful.In my own case, I have to mull over a novel for about two years before I begin writing it. That may or may not work for others—we each have what works for us and it’s not the same for everyone. Don’t take that as a literal timeline. I don’t think about a novel for two years, then sit down and write it, send it out, and then start thinking about the next one for two years, then… I’ve always got multiple novel ideas running around in my mind—at any given time at least four or five—so whenever I finish one, I’ve got several more I’m ready to plunge into. And, many times, I’m working on several novels at the same time. In fact, at this moment in time, I’m rewriting three novels and working on two new ones. But, I would never begin a novel a week after coming up with an idea. That would be the way to failure, at least in my case. I know from experience that a story of that length needs time to mature and for me to work out the logic of it and see if it’s indeed, a story that will occupy my interest for the length of time it takes to write it. Make no mistake—it’s hard work to write a novel and I wouldn’t enter into that fray unless I was as prepared as I could be.And that’s what I suggest for those who get that “Smell of the rain…” kind of image and inspiration for a novel. Sit on it for awhile. Think about it. Kick the tires. See if it has legs. See if you can see any depth in it. If something else comes up and diverts your attention away from it, that probably means the idea really wasn’t novel-worthy to begin with. But… the idea that won’t go away, that begs to be told, that begins to unfold in your imagination over a period of time of at least a month or two and hopefully even longer—that’s probably an idea that has legs and one you can run that marathon with. Keep in mind that ideas are cheap. They’re everywhere. There are at least as many ideas as there are politicians who will promise you something and promise you it won’t cost anything. Legions of ideas…If you do that one thing—let that “Smell of the rain…” image percolate for at least a month at minimum—and at the end of the month it still burns that white-hot heat it had when it first came to you, then you might just have an idea you can spend the time and energy on that it will take you to fill up nearly a ream of paper. If it “disappears” from your thoughts for long stretches of time, what you probably had was just a gossamer. Go with the idea that won’t let you go.And then, when it becomes a bestseller and you’re on the Letterman show, you can do what Snyder advises. Use it as a story to tell on the show about how you came up with the idea.Just keep in mind always that whenever you get one of those “Smell of the rain on the road at dawn” moments, that it’s just the start of an idea and that’s all. As we say in poker, “Don’t bet the rent money on it.” Not until it won’t let you go and you have no choice but to write it or seek therapy.And get Snyder’s books. They’re amazing!

In reality, this won’t be an “annual” post unless I do one next year since this is the very first one. I plan to do one next year, though. If I remember...And… I’m aware that it’s late, but I thought that appropriate, since I always forget it until about a week later, despite a loving wife (Mary) who considers it her mission in life to let me know about things like this. The only problem is, she always lets me know the day before. Like I’m expected to remember it that long!To make up for not sending a card on time, I decided to send Mom more than just one of those syrupy Hallmark cards. This year, I sent her a cassette tape of the movie, “It’s a Wonderful Life” starring that irrepressible boyish Jimmy Stewart from my private collection. (This is the movie where he isn’t dressed up like a giant rabbit, in which he’s also irrepressible and boyish.)Then, the second I got home from mailing it to her, I realized I’d made a grievous mistake. I hadn’t sent her the movie I thought I had. It dawned on me that I’d sent her an entirely different movie. To be exact, my copy of the classic film noir, College Girls Having Monkey Sex, Part XIV. If you haven’t seen it, it’s the one where the coed from Vassar has her boobs pointed in opposite directions and her co-star ends up with whiplash trying to treat them equally and stay on his mark. (“Mark” for you non-theater majors is the piece of tape the director places on the floor to show the actor where to stand.)Oops.The reason I realized my faux pas, was that when I got home I thought I might want to watch a few minutes of it and couldn’t locate it and then remembered I’d labeled it… you guessed it… It’s a Wonderful Life… in the unlikely event Mary went through my collection looking for a something to watch.I ran all the way back to the post office in hopes I could talk the mail guy into letting me have my package back, but it seems they have rules against that kind of thing. You can guess how that turned out, if you’ve ever had to deal with the United Nazi States of Mail Carriers. Guy treated me like I was the Unibomber. I called him “Cliff”and “Newman” but he didn’t get it.I was in a sweat when I found it had already been shipped, but then I remembered Mom didn’t have a cassette player. Or a VCR. Or, even a TV. She’d sold her TV when The Ed Sullivan Show went off the air a few years ago.The luck of the Irish!Realizing I better do something more than send her a tape she couldn’t watch, I asked Mary if we could take her out to dinner.            “When?” she said. “On Father’s Day? That’s the next holiday.”I laughed. (That’s it. I just laughed) Then, I said, “Of course not, silly. This weekend.”“Only if you don’t use that name in the restaurant that you always do,” she said.I agreed and called Mom to give her the good news. “We’d like to take you out to dinner for your big day,” I said. “Where would you like to go?”“Would this be an early Mother’s Day for 2011 or the late one for 2010?”I laughed. (That’s it. I just laughed. I’ve been trained by Mary.) Then I said, “Of course not, silly. The second one. 2010. The battery in my calendar died.”Golden Corral was her first choice, but I talked her out of that. “They’re closed,” I lied. “There was a big pileup of people on walkers and the health department closed them until they widen the ramp. Thirty-six people suffered aluminum whiplash. There are herds of  lawyers everywhere and you couldn't get in even if it was open.”She sounded skeptical, but then said her second choice was Red Lobster. This, to a guy who’s lived in New Orleans half his life and has actually eaten real seafood was like the chef at Ruth’s Chris Steak House grabbing a square hamburger down at Wendy’s on his day off, but hey, it was my mom and it was her day. I looked forward to gazing at their menu with pictures of the nine-pound lobsters on the menu and them seeing the actual three-ounce one they served. To be fair, the actual meal is the same size as the picture when you put them up next to each other.She decided to drive down from where she lived in South Bend to our home in Ft. Wayne, a true adventure for the other drivers on the highway since she’s 88 and drives older than her actual age. You’ve heard that saying? “(Blank) drives like old people fornicate? Slow and jerky?” That’s Mom. If you ever see those long lines on winding country roads where there are 117 cars trailing behind the John Deere tractor, it was Mom who taught that tractor driver how to navigate our rural byways. I suggested she might want to start out the night before to get to our place on time, but she didn’t think that was all that funny.“You’re not too old to get a spanking, Mr. Smartmouth,” she said. Well, yes, I am, Mom. I have gray hair and arthritis and can remember when phones had dials. Besides, how are you going to catch me? I can crawl faster than you can walk. I didn’t say anything like that to her, of course. After all, she’s my mom and deserves respect. Besides, as long as I knew I could outrun her that was enough. I didn’t have to rub it in.Before she hung up, she said, ”You’re not going to use that name you always do in restaurants, are you? Because if you do, I’m not coming.”“No, Mom, I’m not. I’m grown up, now.” Jesus! What do she and Mary do? Get together and compare notes?She gets here, only two and a half hours past her ETA, and we all climb in the car and head for the gastronomical delights only available at national chains.We get to the Red Lobster and I’m anticipating something on my plate that looks like a medium jumbo shrimp that they’re going to try to pawn off as a Maine lobster and we all go in. This takes awhile as we’re proceeding at Mom’s pace which is about as fast as the last day of school.“We should hurry, Mom,” I said. “They close in only six hours.”Mary gives me a dirty look. So does Mom, who says, “You’re not too big to get a spanking.” I consider showing her my driver’s license to show her my age as she’s obviously forgotten, but I don’t. It’s Mother’s Day. Well, not really—that was last week, but we’re operating on the theme of Mother’s Day and I want to remain true to the spirit.I hustle ahead of them and give our name to the hostess.When I come back, Mom says, “How long?” and Mary says, “You didn’t give them that name, did you?”“Twenty minutes,” I say to Mom, and to Mary I just give a pained look, as if to say, “How could you even think I’d do that?”We pass the time listening to Mom complain about the present government and ask to see a menu so  she can make her choice, which is always the same. The lobster/shrimp combo.  I think she just wants to check to make sure they haven’t taken either off the menu. Although, if they ran out of one, they could just serve the one that was left and tell the diner it was the missing one. Who would know?Then, she lays a bomb on me. “I love that movie, you sent me,” she said. “I’m going over to your sister Ann’s house to watch it when I get back home.”And then, our table is announced over the loudspeaker.“Donner, party of three.”I get two dirty looks from the women I’m with.“That’s us,” I say.I love Mother’s Day!mMy wife Mary, just before leaving for Red Lobster on Mother's Day. She's just warned me not to use \"that name\" for our reservation. Is it just me or does she look skeptical when I tell her I won't?"},

He was really a great dog. Mike won a state photography contest with a picture of Buddy reading a book. (All of our animals are required to read books in our house and submit a book report when done)  Our son Mike won the PTA State Championship in the Reflections photography contest when he was in the sixth grade with this photo of his dog Buddy. Check out the title. Mike got the idea himself and set up the shot. He went to Border's Bookstore and got Harry Potter glasses for him to wear. My wife Mary saved the day as we couldn't get Buddy to sit still long enough for Mike to take the shot, when she got the idea to put peanut butter on the rug in front of him. Buddy gave a lick and then lifted his head to try to get the peanut butter off of his tongue and that's when Mike got the shot. He was the first state winner at his elementary school.

Hope you enjoy it.I just realized that in signing books, I'm leaving myself wide-open to have my own handwriting analyzed... Oops...There’s no way I can cover handwriting analysis thoroughly in a couple of posts (or even fifty posts!), but I’ll try to give some of the major points. Again, I’d highly recommend Andrea McNichol’s HANDWRITING ANALYSIS: Putting It to Work for You for a broad view and a starting point. It’s a marvelous book and will give you a great introduction to the science of graphology and it’s just plain entertaining!Just a few of the things a handwriting analysis can reveal about the writer are:1. Drug use2. Cheating3. Criminal behavior4. Health or the presence of disease5. Which potential mate is more considerate6. Who cheated his customer7. Who’s lying about his age8. Who is liable to cheat with numbers, such as accountants and bookkeepers.9. Level of intelligence10. Strong vs weak work drive11. Extroversion vs introversion13. Who has more energy14. Who’s more reliable and predictable15. Which person wants a divorce16. Which person is a convicted killer17. Who is more aggressive and who is less aggressive18. Who is more depressed and who is happier19. Who tends toward the emotional side of their personality than the intellectual and vice versa20. Who is narrow-minded21. Who holds back his/her feelings22. Who feels more economical23. Who ventures out more24. Who’s more organized25. Who thinks more about the future? About the present? About the past?26. Who feels defensive and has something to hide27. Who’s more reliable and predictableMany, many more!In short, just about everything to do with a person’s personality and nature!Here’s what Carl Jung said about handwriting analysis:No one can get out of his own skin. We act as our psychological past, i.e., as our cerebral organization dictates. For this reason, we are bound to expose ourselves in exactly the same way as we do in our own handwriting.Graphology is the study of all graphic movement. It’s not simply “handwriting analysis.” It’s not our hand or our toes or our mouth (in the case of those who’ve lost limbs and relearned how to write) that decide how we’ll write and make our marks on paper. Those decisions come from our minds and are actually “brain writing.” Those brain prints reveal who we are—how we think, feel and behave. Although our moods may change, part of our handwriting will always remain the same, just as part of you always remains the same.A very telling study of a group of juvenile delinquents was conducted in which the kids were asked to substitute positive handwriting traits in place of their negative traits and their antisocial behavior were significantly changed to more social behavior.There are three aspects of human beings that are reflected in graphology, the physical, the mental, and the emotional. The physical aspects revealed are our identities, the state of our physical health, and the presence of drugs, alcohol or other foreign substances in our bodies. Mental aspects revealed are our intelligence and aptitudes. Emotional aspects that can be determined from our handwriting are how we think, feel and behave.Some interesting facts:1. The slant of your letters reveals the degree to which you express your real emotional feelings to others. It doesn’t say to what degree you have feelings, but to what degree you’ll express them to others. Slanting to the right is to express your real emotional feelings—to be demonstrative, affectionate, passionate. A right slant also indicates a person oriented toward the future. About 70% of American adults have a rightward slant their whole lives.A vertical slant is a person suppressing their real emotional feelings. It’s the slant associated with diplomacy in that you neither express nor repress your feelings—you stay on top of things. It means “head over heart” or thinking rather than feeling and it also indicates a person more oriented toward the present.A leftward slant indicates a person who represses their real emotional feelings. To think one thing but say another, to lean over backwards to avoid emotional situations. Such a slant is associated with those who do first and last what’s best for themselves alone, who are overly materialistic and overly concerned with outward appearances. It also means a person oriented toward the past.It may help to picture slant as a person standing. What does the person leaning toward you indicate? The person standing straight up? The person leaning back from you?There can often be different slants within the same writing sample or even within the same sentence. This is very telling and I don’t have space here to show all the things this indicates.An interesting case study is looking at a sample of Jackie Kennedy’s handwriting shortly after Jack Kennedy’s assassination. It has a decided left slant. It indicates a writer that, at the time, was “cold, reserved, indecisive, not straightforward, masks feelings, hard to fathom, difficult to get along with. Her personal pronoun I (a very revealing word) has an even more pronounced left slant. Also, her signature (also very revealing) is at a distance from the body of the letter examined, indicating a person who is disassociating herself from what she just wrote. The actual note read: “I should have known that it was asking too much to dream that I might have grown old with him.” When her husband was assassinated, reporters reported that Jackie “showed no emotion whatsoever. You wanted her to cry, to do something, but… nothing. That’s typical of a leftward slanter. She also had another characteristic in that sample—a feature called “clubbed stroking.” It’s a feature that usually indicates the potential for cruelty.About 70% of Americans write with a rightward slant, 5% with a vertical, 15% with a leftward slant, and 10% with an unstable slant. A high percentage of teenagers, especially girls, will experiment with a backwarded slant. At the time of this experimentation, the teenager may be experiencing unhappy or rebellious feelings. A very high percentage of gourmet chefs exhibit a rightward slant. They’re very emotional about their work!There are traits associated with individual letters. One seen at times is the “maniacal d.” That’s a small-case “d” that unexpectedly slants far to the right. It indicates… you guessed it… maniacal behavior. What it actually indicates is a loss of control over hand movement to the right, indicative of loss of mental and emotional control. This is a person who is suddenly pulled off balance, and out of emotional control, prone to explosive behavior. The further rightward these d’s or other letters lean, the more the writer is at the mercy of his emotional outbursts. And the more frequently these Maniac d’s appear, the more often the writer goes off the emotional deep end. This is a trait that quite often shows up in the writing of many of the most notorious murderers of our time. Andrea shows an example of this in Steve Grogan’s writing, a member of the Charles Manson family. It’s in Lee Harvey Oswald’s script and many others, including the Zodiac killer.Nearly perfect writing may also be a sign of emotional stress. When writing is too pretty, too perfect, too tight, everything alike as though it had been produced by a typewriter, it means the writer is compensating for an inner feeling of loss of control. These writers are often one step away from cracking up. This type of writer, at this period of their lives, often put rulers under their writing, and are people who write too mechanically. Many go along in life, seemingly handling everything until, boom! They lose control and go berserk. Again, as I said in the first post of this subject, at times this is job-created, particularly among elementary teachers and especially during the time they are teaching cursive writing to their students.A sign of above-average intelligence is a writer who combines print and cursive and observers may remark that it looks “sloppy.” This is a positive sign, unless it is so sloppy as to be unintelligible, and then it becomes a negative sign, indicating a person who doesn’t really wish to communicate clearly. Extremes of any trait can indicate a negative, rather than a positive trait.Beware the accountant who writes down numbers that are hard to make out! There’s a reason they do this and they’re usually unaware that they do… or they’d change so they didn’t get caught…There are dozens and dozens of traits that an analyst uses to determine the writer’s personality and predict behavior from. No one trait by itself is reliable. It’s also important to take several samples, written at different periods, if possible, to get the most accurate assessment.I hope I’ve whetted your appetite a bit to find out more about this fascinating science. Again, I’d highly recommend Andrea McNichol’s book to begin with.Just don’t have your novel’s detective characters saying they can tell a writer’s age, sex or if they’re left-or right-handed!"},

It’s much too big a topic for a simple reply. Hope this helps, Kari, and everyone else. It’s very important to be accurate in our facts in novels and stories (and screenplays, but no one much pays attention to facts in movies…) My lovely wife Mary, as seen through my big feet. (Us professional photogs call this \"framing.\" I trust you caught the irony there...) You'll meet Mary further down in a little story about felon's hooks and vacuum cleaners...First of all, to establish the bona fides of handwritiing analysis or graphology--it's a reputable and acknowledged science. It's accepted in courts in all 50 states, and courts don't allow anything that isn't provable or scientific. They don't allow tea leaf reading or horoscopes, for example, or allow dog whisperers or horse whispers to take the stand and present evidence. There are several leading teaching medical schools that have a graphologist on hand to diagnose various diseases and illnesses. I had an interesting experience years ago with a teaching colleague when I noticed a trait in her handwriting and said to her that her handwriting showed she had pain and disease in her shins. Shocked, she looked at me and said that no one knew this, but that she had severe shin splints. It showed in her handwriting through a trait called “stasis.” There are four leading universities at present that offer accredited courses or degrees in the U.S. In many western European universities, if you get a degree in psychology, you're required to take a course in graphologhy to obtain your degree. It's a bona fide, legally-accepted science. There are provable tenets, in other words. And, there are three things you cannot tell by handwriting analysis: age, sex, and handedness. Those are all old wives' tales. Also, I'd beware of Internet sources for facts, particularly Wikipedia. Those are notoriously unreliable. Anyone can post anything on resources like that and most are just opinion and not to be trusted.Everybody's handwriting is different. Within a family, a son or daughter's handwriting will often resemble the parent or guardian who was the most influential (not necessary the most loved), but it's still unique to that person.What most people \"think\" looks like \"male\" handwriting is that it's larger or perhaps \"sloppier.\" The fact is, there are just as many women as men who have large or sloppy handwriting. More accurately, large handwriting is a trait of being an extrovert. Sloppy handwriting is often a trait of higher intelligence than average. Small handwriting is a trait of being an introvert. No one trait defines a personality. It takes literally dozens to produce a reliable picture.“Waverly” handwriting can be an elderly person’s handwriting; it can also be the result of disease or ill-health. It can also indicate emotional illness. By itself, it doesn’t indicate age at all. It also doesn’t matter what cursive system a person was taught by, Palmer or otherwise. It really isn’t “handwriting” analyasis. Properly, It is graphic movement. A person doesn’t even have to be able to write to have their writing or doodles or drawings studied and by the same elements as handwriting is accessed. Children who haven’t yet learned to write can be analyzed with the same traits as those can do write, just as easily.Your handwriting is your handwriting and it is unique to you. Even if it resembles your dominant parent, it’s still unique to you. There are dozens and dozens of traits that need to be analyzed to give an accurate picture. Just a few include: slant, baseline, margins, spacing, pressure, size, speed, zones, printing vs connected writing, connecting strokes, signatures, the personal pronoun I, and many, many others. No one trait can identify the three things mentioned and even with all the traits analyzed, those three things can’t be told.If a person is say, right-handed, and loses that hand and learns to write with his left hand, his handwriting will, over time, become the same as the right-handed writing. If he loses that hand also and learns to write with his foot or even his teeth, the handwriting will eventually become the same. Handwriting is a function of the brain and exhibits personality traits. I had a student years ago who had suffered a stroke and had lost the use of her right hand. She learned to write with her left. About a year before I had her in class, her feeling returned and she reverted back to her right hand to write. When I told the class that about it doesn’t matter which hand you write with, if you write long enough with the other it will become the same as the original hand. She gasped and said I was exactly right. The next day she brought in samples from before when she wrote right handed and later samples she’d written just before her feeling returned from her left hand, and a sample of her present writing. All three were exactly the same. That doesn’t mean the day after she lost use of her right hand, her left-handed handwriting was the same—that’s impossible. But, after about a year of writing with her left it had gradually returned to the same handwriting she had produced with her right hand.The thing I felt was wrong in the book I mentioned was that the character professed his take on handwriting as “fact” and it was absolutely wrong. That this guy was a detective compounded the error. He didn’t say he “thought” his dead girlfriend’s hair seemed longer; he stated it as an absolute fact that it was. That’s different than a character giving an incorrect opinion. He observed the dead woman and reported what he “saw.” Which was impossible. Hair does not grow after the body dies. Impossible. And, what made it worse was that he didn’t say it grew a tiny bit—he indicated it had grown a lot, had been growing for the two years since she had died. And, then, this same character interpreted a handwriting example as being “male” and then from an “older” person. Neither are possible to determine. This ruined this character’s reliability for me and ruined the book as well and probably will keep me from reading any more of this writer’s books. These are extremely easy facts to research and verify (not from Wikipedia, sorry!). In fact, if anyone’s interested a good source to begin a study of the science is Andrea McNichol’s Handwriting Analysis: Putting it to Work for You. It’s very accessible and easy to understand. Andrea teaches the subject at USC and has solved hundreds of crimes for law enforcement agencies through graphology, including the legitimacy of the Howard Hughes will, the Ted Bundy murders, the Hitler Diaries, and the Billionaire Boys Club case. She’s regularly called in to solve in-house theft by Fortune 500 companies.In fact, most people are unaware of this but the majority of Fortune 500 companies employ handwriting analysis of their candidates for middle- and upper-management hires, and increasingly for routine hires. They just don’t tell the applicant. There’s a large firm in Louisville who has the lion’s share of this business, analyzing hundreds and hundreds of thousands of handwriting samples for the business world. If you ever interview for a job and the ask you to just “jot down a paragraph or two about your life goals” or “where you see yourself in five/ten years,” it’s almost certain they’re going to send that sample to the Louisville firm or another like it. They won’t tell you that’s what they’re doing, but it usually is.Here in Ft. Wayne years ago, I interviewed Barry LaBov for his international company, LaBov and Beyond. Barry’s company pioneered on-hold phone messages and does all kinds of advertising business, such as create jingles for companies for advertising. Among their clients are Disney, Chrysler, Ford, G.E… in short, just about all of the major corporations. Their business is unique, in that their employees not only have be to salespeople, they also have to be musically-gifted. They don’t hire “off the street,” and Barry told me it takes an average of two years to train an employee to where they begin contributing to the bottom line. Who they hire is extremely important to them. He said that because of that, they used to use all the best personality tests and profiling and all the best sophisticated tools available to make sure they hired the right people. Even with the best scientific tools there were, his retention rate for employees was less than 60%. He was talked into hiring handwriting analysis on his hires and was skeptical. But, he swears by it now. His retention rate today is almost 99%. In fact, he said at the beginning they were going to hire a woman who was at the top of all their scientific charts as to personality, prediction of success, etc., and it was between her and another woman who didn’t test nearly as high, but seemed qualified. The second woman exhibited a much higher score than the first one and Barry said he almost didn’t hire her, but he did and he said she’s turned out to be the single best employee he’s ever had. She was promoted to senior v.p. and still is. The other woman went to a competitor and did great for a year and then the negative traits the handwriting analysis had predicted surfaced and the competitor was not only forced to fire her, but pressed charges against her for intellectual theft. Today, Barry says he wouldn’t hire a janitor without a handwriting analysis. It’s so much more accurate than anything else.Here are some traits that stand out. Keep in mind that some handwriting is occupation-determined. For instance, most folks think doctors have terrible handwriting, barely legible. Well, it is, many times. It’s occupation-related. They write so many prescriptions that their handwriting deteriorates. Engineers, many times print everything (doesn’t matter for analysis if it’s printed or cursive or even what cursive method they learned). That’s because they write lots of memos and they have to be clear. That’s job related. Although, there’s another factor at work with engineers. Many of their personalities tend to be “things-oriented” rather than “people-oriented.” That makes a person who is or has learned to be wary of other people Therefore, many of them print in their casual life as well, and that’s considered a negative trait. People instinctively realize that their handwriting reveals their personalities and when a person prints, you have to make sure it’s not just a job-related habit. It may also indicate a person who doesn’t want others to know the “real” him. A person who not only prints, but always prints in all capitals, is really a person who doesn’t want others to know the real person he is. Doesn’t mean he’s a psychopath or anything; just means this is a person who will probably not reveal his inside self to others until after a long time when he finally feels he can trust them.Most people hide their real selves. The thing is, they can hide it from others, even close relatives like a wife or husband, but they can’t hide it in their handwriting.There are several extremely negative traits. One that always stands out is the “felon’s hook.” I can’t reproduce it here, but it’s a writer who doesn’t write the descenders on letters like y or j, for instance. Instead of a loop, like most of us use, it’s more like an upside-down U in the descender. Studies show that over 87% of those incarcerated will exhibit a felon’s hook in their writing while they’re incarcerated. My wife has one that appears in her handwriting when she’s fibbing or lying about something. (She won’t handwrite anything for me any longer, but she doesn’t realize I can tell just as much from her printing. Hope she doesn’t read this!). A few years ago, we had to spring for a new vacuum cleaner which we really couldn’t afford but had to have. She bought one and then spent the first week cussing at it as it didn’t perform like she thought it should. “Take it back,” I suggested, but she said she couldn’t. She got in a no-return clearance sale. “Well, I guess we’re stuck with it then,” I said, and she reluctantly agreed. But, it was clear she hated it. Well, the next Monday which was both of our day off, I went to get coffee and when I got back, Mary was gone. She left a note saying she was just running out to the mall for a little bit. That was all it said. Very innocuous. When she got back, I said, “What kind of vacuum cleaner did you buy?” She was absolutely shocked. That’s exactly what she’d done. She was going to tell me… when she figured out a way to do so without having me have a cow. “How’d you know?” she asked. I showed her her note… and the felon’s hook she’d used for the g in running. That told me instantly she was fibbing about something and since that was the logical thing—the thing we’d been discussing intensely, I knew that’s what she’d done.In my classes, when I talk about handwriting analysis, I tell my students to write a chatty letter to their best friend and to put in a small lie and I’ll see if I can find it. Just about every time, my batting average is 100% Not 90%. 100%. Ask Sarah F. who’s on here if she’s reading his. We’ve taught together and she’s seen me do this. I won’t reveal how it’s done… gotta keep some secrets. I don’t even read what they’ve written. Don’t have to.The worst trait in handwriting analysis probably isn’t what you think. The most negative trait is handwriting that looks almost perfect. It looks almost exactly like the cursive writing we saw back in third grade in the books that taught us cursive writing. Now, this can be job-related—if the writer is an elementary school teacher and feels it important to provide a good model for her students’ handwriting, then that’s job-related and normal. What makes it a negative trait is if the writer doesn’t normally write that perfectly and then you observe their writing getting more and more perfect. If you see that happening in a friend or loved one, I’d suggest talking to them. They may well be suicidal. It’s important that you realize that if this is the person’s normal handwriting, it doesn’t mean much. It’s only when it begins to change toward perfect writing. What’s happening is that a person who starts to have thoughts of suicide is a person who perceives their world is out of their control. They feel they can no longer control their world… but they can control their handwriting. And they begin to do so. I told a class I taught this at the University of Toledo a few years ago and a very shy girl I’ll just call K, came up to me and said I was exactly right. (I already knew I was…) She said she’d attempted suicide eight times and had always kept a diary and she knew without looking that every time she got close to an attempt, her handwriting grew smaller and smaller and more than that, it began to get more and more perfect. She brought in her diary to class the next day and shared her story and showed us the places where she’d made suicide attempts and sure enough. In the days leading up to each attempt, the handwriting noticeably got more and more perfect, until the days she tried to take her life (and she really tried—none of them were that “cry for help”) and on that day her handwriting looked like it was traced out of a third-grade handwriting copy book. It was classic. Just passing this on so that if someone you know and love begins writing like this, at least sit down and have a talk with them. You may find you’ll be glad you did.I can write more on this subject if you guys want me to. If several post interest in learning more, I’d be happy to provide more. It takes about three years of intensive study under an accredited graphologist (there are two nationally-recognized organization, and I was fortunate to be able to study under the national secretary of the most prominent one.). One more story. I taught one time with a woman who was a lawyer and introduced her to it and she was fascinated. The upshot was, she studied the science, became accredited and within three years became a millionaire. How? She formed a company that picked juries for lawyers by their handwriting. She’s more accurate than any other method and she can’t handle all the business. Today, she has three other full-time people working for her and is ready to go national. She’s already well-known in the region she lives in and has more business than she can handle.I always tell my young students I can give them a way to become a millionaire within three years and I can. So far, no one’s taken me up on it. Takes a lot of work and study. Handwriting analysis is the single most accurate gauge of personality that exists. If that’s so… and it is… then a person who learns the science enough to be certified, could hang out her shingle and cater to one group only and she’ll be swamped with business. An average analysis by a certified graphologist will run from $100 to $500. It takes half an hour to an hour to provide a thorough analysis. What do you think a certified person would make if she opened a business just for women to see what their proposed fiancée was really like? See what his true personality is. See if he’s a liar or honest? All of those things and more are revealed by graphology. Especially women who had been married before and maybe has a child or two and has already been burned? Men, as well, but this is a business I think will attract more women than men. Do the math. How many people do you know would pay to find out the true personality of the guy or woman she or he was considering marrying?Just going back over your questions, Kari, to make sure I didn’t neglect any of them. You cannot tell a person’s age by handwriting—any age can have wavy handwriting and every age does. You can’t tell sex. Women don’t write a bit differently than men. We think they do when we see writing that perhaps looks bold. Well, just as many women have a bold hand than men. No difference in that population whatsoever. We just think there is, but there isn’t any difference. And, you absolutely cannot tell if the writer is left- or right-handed. We see lefties who learned to write on those desks built for right-handers and we mistakenly think because of the angle they hold their hands that their handwriting is slanted differently. Not in the least. The way the writing slants says nothing at all about which hand they used. If it leans predominantly left, that’s a trait that says this person plays life close to the vest—he doesn’t reveal himself readily or easily to others. Usually somewhat reserved. Writing that leans to the right indicates a person who’s a “hale, well-met” kind of guy. A born salesman. The minute he meets you, he’s your best friend. He’s the social guy. One whose writing is straight up? A person between the other two. Not as standoffish and nonrevealing as the left-slanter and not as forward and as much of a party animal as the right-slanted writer. He’ll become your close friend quicker than the left-slanted one, but not as quickly as the right-slanted one. However, you can’t determine personality by a single trait, but that’s one of the things slant reveals.Let me know if y’all would like more on this,okay? Those interested in looking at this closer, get Andrea’s book. You can get it cheap on www.abebooks.com. Thanks for posing the questions, Kari. Hope I've covered them okay. I love talking about this stuff!HoswoawH"},

In this material, I show how actions both define character and show character arc, among other things.I’m shopping the proposal for this book around. Any feedback you can give me would be appreciated.(Audience filing in for my presentation of Thelma & Louise at Microburst, at Phoenix College) The writer who can master the art and craft of defining their characters by their actions is going to be the author whose work gets read. By lots and lots of folks… Enough, hopefully, that you’ll never again have to say to someone about the novel you’ve written that it’s “only available in my room.”Movie people do this better than almost anyone. We can learn a lot from these Hollywood folks!            Most of us as fiction writers flesh out our characters with the use of description, via dialogue, by the interior thoughts of characters and by similar methods. All of these are good techniques and work well in the short story and novel. However, if the author ignores the use of using physical actions to help create their characters and to also show how they’ve evolved due to the events that happen along the way in the story (that character arc us writing teachers are always talking about), they’re missing what can be the most powerful tool of all. This is an area we can really make our novels come alive and impact the reader on a much deeper level.The use of description is perhaps the weakest of the novelist’s tools in terms of character description. What of the following makes more of an impact in the reader’s mind? To read: “Elizabeth was an arthritic old woman.” Or, to read: Elizabeth labored up the stairs, a painful step at a time. She paused at each step, grasped the handrail with both hands and forced her ancient legs up yet another step. The second example wins, hands-down. Why? Because we “see” an action the character takes and because we see it happening it has an emotional impact on us. In the first example, we’re “told” what the character is (arthritic). Doesn’t make much of an impression at all. Not even close to the impression we get when we see her inching painfully up the stairs.This is important enough that I’ll say it again: Characters are defined best and on a deeper level by their actions. As are their character arcs. You know, that deal where the character emerges at the end of the story a different person than when the story began as a result of all they’d gone through during the course of the tale. Why? Because they experience what the character does and what the character experiences at the same time the character does. They’re not being “told” this character has undergone a sea change and asked to take it on faith—they “see” it with their own eyes, and are therefore convinced to a degree not remotely possible with the author “telling” them there’s been a change via their thoughts or any of the other aforementioned techniques.            A movie that illustrates brilliantly how all this can be accomplished through the character’s actions is screenwriter Callie Khouri’s Thelma & Louise. We’ll be looking closely at this film in this chapter and others, as it’s one of those rare movies that provide many, many teaching moments that can be valuable to fiction writers.            The basic plot of Thelma & Louise, is that two friends plan to go on a weekend getaway fishing in the mountains. On the way there, they stop at a roadhouse for a quick drink or two and Thelma gets sexually attacked by Harlan in the parking lot. Louise saves her friend by putting a gun to Harlan’s head just as he’s trying to penetrate Thelma. Situation defused, Harlan just has to say one last insult and Louise shoots and kills him. The women flee the scene and the rest of the movie is basically a chase scene, ending with the women opting for suicide rather than to go prison.            The plot is fairly simple on the surface, but the characterizations Khouri has created of these people make this an extremely complex film. What is magnificent about their characterizations is that they are each revealed chiefly through their actions. Virtually every single line in the script and every moment on the screen can be studied to your gain. I’ve watched this movie more than a hundred times and each time learned something new, both from the script Khouri has created and from the brilliant work these talented actors and the director Ridley Scott bring to the project.First, let’s look at the physical actions Khouri has given to character Thelma (as played by Geena Davis) which define her character and brilliantly carry the viewer through as she transforms into a “new” person at the end. Louise is also given actions to define her character and arc, but we’ll mostly be looking at Thelma’s. Once you’ve read this, then the script, and then watched the movie, take an extra step and go back and see how Louise’s actions inform her character as well.*                                                          *                                                          *The setup*                                                          *                                                          *            We’ll begin with the “setup.” The structure of movies is that roughly the first ten minutes serve as the “setup.” This is where the principle characters are introduced and we learn who they are and what their situation is and the inciting incident and story problem are dramatized.            In the beginning of the setup of Thelma & Louise, there are a series of intercuts between the dual protagonists. We see Louise (played by Susan Sarandon) at her work—slinging hash in a Denny’s-type restaurant. We see Thelma at home with her emotionally-abusive and immature husband Darryl (played by Stephen Tobolowsky), a guy who’s transcended the role of male chauvinist pig to that of male chauvinist hog.            What actions does she perform that define her character? The very first one is her dialogue with Louise. The movie opens with Louise at a pay phone at the restaurant calling Thelma, asking her if she’s ready to leave on her trip. Here’s the way it looks in the script:*                                                          *                                                          *Louise(at pay phone)I hope you’re packed, little sister, ‘cause we are outtahere tonight.(By the way, when Louise calls her “little sister,” this also defines their relationship. As you’ll see, Louise begins in an almost “mother” role and Thelma as the child and in the very first line of dialogue in the movie, Khouri has already begun to define that relationship. An interesting aside to this is that this was virtually the only thing that director Ridley Scott changed from Khouri’s script. Instead of—as she had written—the words “little sister”—he changed it to “little housewife.” Reason? He thought the audience would think that they were literally sisters. Didn’t trust their intelligence…)*                                                          *                                                          *            Thelma responds with her first dialogue, which likewise immediately begins to define her character.*                                                          *                                                          *INT. THELMA’S KITCHEN—MORNING Thelma(whispering guiltily)                        Well, wait now. I still have to ask Darryl if I can go.*                                                          *                                                          *            Right off the bat, we can tell from what she says to Louise that she’s one of those “dutiful little wives.” We don’t know at this point if Darryl is her boyfriend or husband, but we do know from what she says that she feels she has to get permission from him, and that bespeaks volumes about their relationship, whichever it is.            But, as Louise answers her offscreen on the phone, and we hear Louise’s voice, Khouri gives Thelma a great piece of “actor’s business” (action) that really shows her character and where she’s at in her relationship with Darryl. Here’s Khouri’s action for her character (italics mine):*                                                          *                                                          *Thelma has the phone tucked under her chin as she cuts out coupons from the newspaper and pins them on a bulletin board already covered with them. We see various recipes torn out from women’s magazines along the lines of “101 Ways to Cook Pork.”*                                                          *                                                          *            If that action doesn’t show us who Thelma is and what kind of person she is, nothing ever will! In less than fifteen seconds on the screen, Khouri has given us both a bit of dialogue and a specific action that deliver us a three-dimensional character and speaks volumes about who she is.            Then, after she hangs up from her conversation with Louise, Thelma goes to the bottom of the stairs, leans on the banister, and yells up, “Darryl! Honey, you’d better hurry up!”            Again, with dialogue, she’s shown she’s the dutiful little wife, pandering to her husband almost as if he was a little child and she the mom urging him to get up. You can just tell that this is a daily routine and that she has to be the “mom” to her husband… and we get all this before we even see Darryl. By her dialogue and by her actions. All in about thirty seconds.            Darryl makes his appearance and Khouri defines his character also by his actions. First, by the way he’s dressed and the way he acts. Khouri gives him this appearance: Darryl comes trotting down the stairs. Polyester was made for this man and he’s dripping in “men’s” jewelry.            She further defines his character by his response to Thelma’s urging him to “hurry up.” He says, “Dammit, Thelma, don’t holler like that! Haven’t I told you I can’t stand it when you holler in the morning.”            Less than a minute has gone by in the story and we’ve already got a crystal-clear view of these two people and of their relationship. Thelma then replies (sweetly and coyly), “I’m sorry, doll, I just didn’t want you to be late.”            Next, Khouri provides the character of Darryl with a very revealing bit of action, when she writes: Darryl is checking himself out in the hall mirror and it’s obvious he likes what he sees. He exudes overconfidence for reasons that never become apparent…He is making imperceptible adjustments to his overmoussed hair. (Then, another action by Thelma that further defines her character. Italics mine.) Thelma watches approvingly.            In the briefest span of time, we see these two people for exactly who and what they are. All delivered via their actions (mostly) and a bit of dialogue.            Louise's character is defined even before Thelma's, in the very first scene. She's waiting tables and one of her \"tops\" has a group of teenaged girls, whom she admonishes for smoking, citing the well-worn chestnut that \"smoking will stunt your growth.\" This action informs us of her character and role in the movie—that of the mother. Immediately after she's chastised the girls, she goes into the kitchen for a break and has a cigarette herself. Not only does it define her mothering character, it shows us that she's an unreliable character. She preaches one thing but does another. Pretty much what a normal parent might do!            There are countless other examples of how Callie Khouri defines each and every character by their action—virtually everything the people in her story does defines their characters. There isn’t any “actor’s business for the sake of actor’s business” anywhere in the script. These aren’t things they just “do” while delivering their lines. They do serious plot and story work.            Let’s move on.*                                                          *                                                          *Guns to create character arch*                                                          *                                                          *            Tools and how characters use them are very effective ways to create a character's growth. In Thelma and Louise, one of the most important actions Khouri uses to deliver Thelma’s character arc in the story is when the two women meet at Thelma’s house to begin their trip. Thelma has elected to bring along a revolver and it’s the way she physically handles it that is a particularly brilliant piece of writing by Khouri. Thelma picks up the gun gingerly by the thumb and two fingers, obviously terrified of the weapon when she takes it out of the drawer to pack. That action is reinforced when, minutes later, she reveals to Louise she's brought the weapon and she again holds it as if she's afraid it will go off and shoot her when she follows Louise's order and puts it in the older woman's purse. By the end of the story, she’s whipping the gun around like Doc Holliday’s been mentoring her out behind the O.K. Corral. This one simple action and the way it evolves during the story by itself beautifully shows the viewer how far Thelma’s come and how she’s emerged as a much different person as a result of what she’s undergone.*                                                          *                                                          *Smoking to show character arc*                                                          *                                                          *            However, Khouri doesn’t use just this one action to create a character arc for Thelma. Smoking is another one. We've already talked about Louise toking on a cigarette after she's admonished the teenagers for smoking. At the beginning of the trip, Thelma pantomimes smoking a cigarette, imitating the older and more world-weary Louise. The action is of a child, imitating an adult. As events progress, she eventually becomes a true pro, chain-smoking to beat the band and looking like she’s been at it since she was twelve and a half. At the beginning, while Louise smokes a cigarette during their phone conversation (adult action), Thelma munches on a candy bar, the act of a child.            The physical action of smoking is used in many places in this movie to symbolize important points. For instance, after their money has been stolen by J.R. (played by Brad Pitt), Louise has completely given up. Rather than “tell” us she’s quit the good fight, via some awkward dialogue, Khouri uses the physical action of smoking to show us. Waiting in the car, while Thelma goes into a convenience store/gas station (which she’s going to hold up, unbeknownst to Louise), she lights up, takes a desultory half-drag and then tosses the cigarette away. More than any dialogue ever could, this simple action of resignation shows the audience exactly the level of despair Louise has sunk to. She’s given up the only pleasure she had left in life (smoking). A second or two later, she takes out a tube of lipstick and begins to apply it, almost as a lifelong habit in her role as a “woman,” (a woman as defined by men) only to toss that away as well. Hard on the heels of giving up smoking, she’s now given up any pretense of being what society deems a woman should be as well as her very life, symbolically. With these two simple actions, we are completely convinced of the complete despair Louise feels. She’s stripped bare of everything. Her old life and old person is gone. It's at this point that she begins to achieve true independence. Only by giving up her old life can she proclaim her right to freedom from the tyranny she's lived under all of her life... from men in particular and from society in general.*                                                          *                                                          *Packing*                                                          *                                                          *            In the setup, both women pack for their camping trip to the mountains. There is a vast contrast to their packing \"styles\" which serves to further define their characters by that action. Louise, the \"mom\" and adult, is in control. She wraps garments in individual plastic containers and arranges them neatly in her suitcase. Thelma, in contrast, throws handfuls of clothes into her suitcase and at one point, just dumps her drawers into her suitcase, as a child might. She's definitely not in control of her life, as evidenced by her chaotic packing method. It mirrors her existence, just as Louise's style does hers. If you knew nothing about either woman, as soon as you saw each of them pack, you'd make the firm conclusion that one was in complete charge of herself and the other was more than a little \"scattered.\" You wouldn't have to hear either of them speak or do anything else to figure this out.            Over and over, actions show us both women and how they evolve. In the beginning, Louise is not only a control freak, she's also obsessed with cleanliness. In fact, there's a scene when the antagonist Hal (played by Harvey Keitel) breaks into Louise's apartment runs his finger over a table surface, looking for dust and there isn't any.            Another scene that reinforces her neatness and control jones, is when the women are waiting for drovers to get a herd of cattle around them. \"Don't you scratch my car!\" Louise screams at the men. Later, when they've achieved their freedom, her car is dirty, dusty and just downright filthy... and she doesn't even notice it. Evidence again that her character has evolved.*                                                          *                                                          *Hair*                                                          *                                                          *            Huh? you say. (I heard you.) How is hair a physical action?            Let's take a look.            Remember at the beginning, Khouri has established Louise as the \"in-control\" mother (adult) figure and Thelma as the scattered, undisciplined \"child.\" Louise packs carefully; Thelma tosses her things willy-nilly into the suitcase. Louise smokes; Thelma chomps on a candy bar. Thelma is terrified of guns and Louise is an old hand at firearms. And so on.            Now, look at their hair when the trip begins. Louise's is neat and pinned up. Under firm control. Thelma's hangs loose and free. Hair is important in this movie. Not only does it reflect the individual character at the moment, it also reveals the state of the relationship between the two women at a given point in the plot.            As the story progresses, Louise's hair begins to come down at various plot points. As she inches closer and closer to her freedom from men, the hair comes down, little by little. I won't go into every single scene where hair plays a role, although it does in just about all of them—watch the movie and focus only on the hair and the times when it is up or down or in-between on each woman and you can quickly see how hair affects what's going on and the present state of their relationship with each other.            There is a point, two-thirds through the film, when the two women reverse their roles. Thelma becomes the mother, the one in control, and Louise reverts to being a helpless child. Shortly after that, the two begin to move toward equality and their hair symbolically reflects that stage perfectly, in that both women are driving down the road and both have their hair partly \"up\" in the exact same \"do.\" Not only that, but to further strengthen their new-found equality, they are both singing along in perfect harmony to a song on the radio. All actions.*                                                          *                                                          *Spitbath*                                                          *                                                          *            Let's imagine a hypothetical scene. A mother has just picked up her little girl at the playground and they have to be at the girl's best friend's house for her birthday party. The woman's daughter has grime on her face from the dusty playground. What does the mother do? Why, she gives her a spitbath, of course. That's just what moms do! I know from (painfully embarrassing) personal experience. Who among us hasn't been an actor in this familiar drama!            Look at the scene immediately following the killing of Harlan. They're fleeing the scene and then Louise orders Thelma to pull over. Thelma's got gore on her cheeks from the bloody nose Harlan gave her when he hit her during his attempted rape. What does Louise do? (After she throws up of course, and re-enters the car, ordering Thelma back to the passenger side.) She gives her a spitbath, an action right out of Parenting 101! You can find it on page three.            Again, right after the shooting, Louise enters the restaurant bathroom and spies a tiny drop of blood on her cheek and begins rubbing it furiously, showing by her action the emotion she feels at killing Harlan.*                                                          *                                                          *Sex*                                                          *                                                          *            I saw your eyes light up at this topic heading. Don't deny it. Just means you're normal.            Sex is powerful, isn't it. We pay attention when we encounter sex on the screen or among the pages of a novel.            Many writers write sizzling sex scenes that are definitely worth the price of admission. But... most of the time, those scenes don't do all that they could. Khouri gets Prius mileage out of her big sex scene, the one where Thelma and J.R. (Brad Pitt) make love. As Janet Burroway tells us in her wonderful book, Writing Fiction (the most widely-used writing textbook used in America), that character changes must always be occasioned by a physical event. Khouri uses this maxim brilliantly.            Up until the point when J.R. steals their money, Louise is in charge—the parent—and Thelma is the child. When they run to the motel room and find out J.R.'s stolen all their money, a role reversal takes place. Louise gives up and reverts to being the child—all hope is gone in her eyes. It is then that a miracle happens. Thelma becomes the parent in charge. (Incidentally, this scene is foreshadowed by an earlier scene in a similar motel room, when Thelma collapses on the bed in tears, clearly the child, and Louise takes charge.) It's Thelma's coming-of-age moment.            How can Thelma change this drastically? Remember, character change must be caused by something physical that happens to the character. Have you guessed what the physical action was that allowed Thelma to do a 180?            Sex.            That's right. But... not just any old sex. After all, she's been married four years and dated her husband Darryl for the four years of high school before that and has had lots of sex. But, what J.R. and she had was a different kind of sex for her. It was adult, mature sex. Not the version of teenager backseat dalliances she engaged in with her husband. No, this was grownup sex between two adults who approached each other and had sex as equals. And, it was because of this that she transformed into an adult and was able to take charge. Without this kind of sex, she would no doubt have stayed the child she was and would have most likely collapsed in surrender and defeat on the bed right along with Louise, as she'd already done in previous scenes in one way or another up to that moment.            This is the biggest turning point in the movie and the most dramatic moment and Khouri does it up right. First, she makes sure Thelma's defining moment isn't obscured by anything. Louise leaves their room first and it's clear she's going to be having sex herself with her boyfriend Jimmy (the Michael Madsen character). But... we never see even a glimpse of these two between the sheets doing the nasty. Why? Because Khouri wanted to make sure that the most important scene in the story wasn't obscured or overshadowed  in the least which it might have been if we'd been witness to both women and their lovemaking.+                                                          *                                                          *Booze            Another action Khouri provides Thelma to establish her character and illustrate her character arc, is that at first Thelma buys liquor in “miniatures,” the same thing a young person might buy. Later, when she has adult sex with Brad Pitt, one of the symbolic things that happen during their lovemaking is when they sweep the empty miniature bottles onto the floor. Then, when she robs the convenience store, she takes the “adult” or regular size liquor bottle. Just another action to show how she’s progressed in her character arc.            There are other actions in this fine film that the screenwriter Khouri employs, but these should give you a very good idea of not only how to use such actions to inform your character and his or her developmental arc, but how vital providing them is.            Now. How might we use these techniques for our fiction? Good question! Here's some suggestions.*                                                          *                                                          *Proscription*                                                          *                                                          *            Since Thelma & Louise first hit the movie theaters in 1987, the country has undergone a universal negative change in its attitude toward smoking. That means that it's probably best not to adopt Khouri's ingenious use of cigarettes in your story in an anti-smoking climate. What's kind of interesting is that while smoking has mostly vanished from movies, when it does appear, mostly it signals that this is a \"bad guy.\" Instead of wearing black, the villain these days is puffing on a Marlboro Red. What might you substitute? Well, there are any number of possibilities.            Let's say you're writing a coming-of-age novel or at least a novel with coming-of-age elements and you want something like Khouri's symbol to show the passage of your character from childhood into adulthood. What are some artifacts or actions that we associate primarily with adults and not with children?            One that comes to mind is drinking. If you watched the movie, you'll recall how Khouri has Thelma buying whiskey in those little \"miniatures\" when she was in her role as a child. That's how a kid might buy booze. When she \"grew up\" after experiencing \"adult sex\" with J.R., she switched to regular(adult)-sized bottles. To show your character as achieving adulthood you might show her switching from flavored vodkas to regular martinis, or you might set him up by having him order drinks mixed with colas—say a rum and Coke—to a Jack and water. (Although there seem to be plenty of adults who still enjoy pop in their adult beverages...) A better example might be having your character always running around in t-shirts with athletes' names on the back. To show he's achieved maturity, you could have him toss his Michael Jordan tees and begin wearing shirts without logos or jocks' names on the back. I heard a radio dj commenting on this one day and open it up for discussion among his listeners and the consensus reached was that after the age of thirty, a man just looks silly walking around with another guy's name on his shirt.            The point is to be observant and see what actions kids make that adults don't. In one of my short stories, \"Blue Skies,\" the protagonist experienced an epiphany when he noticed that his mentally-challenged daughter Celsi still ate her sandwiches that were cut diagonally by taking the first bite from the center. He knew she was never going to get better when he and his wife and Celsi were out for her sixteenth birthday and she still took her first bite out of the middle. His observation was that most adults he observed always bit the tip of the sandwich off first.            There are plenty of examples around. Just be observant and you'll find them.            And don't limit yourself to just coming-of-age actions. Use actions for every significant change in your character. For instance, you may want to write a story about a man who has terminal cancer and your story is about the stages such a person might go through in coming to terms with his fate.            Let's say that right after \"Charley\" learns of his impending doom, he goes through a period of utter hopelessness. From that he segues into a kind of hysterical hedonism, where he does everything he's always wanted to do, but was too conservative to do while healthy. From that you may have him moving on to a period in which he takes huge risks with his life. Maybe you have him buy a motorcycle—something he's always wanted but didn't for a couple of reasons. One, he was simply afraid of motorcycles, and two, he didn't feel the family's budget could accommodate one. Now that he's only got months to live, he races out and plunks down a check for a new Harley Sportster. His wife is beside herself. He tears through town at breakneck speed, at little or no concern for his safety. She's really worried because he refuses to buy a helmet. She even goes out and buys him one for his birthday present, but he never puts it on.            And then, something happens. He has an epiphany. (What the epiphany is and how he gets it is your job—you didn't think I was going to write the whole darned thing, did you?) Something happens that somehow gives him hope and makes him come back to earth and realize that even though he's terminal, he's still responsible for his family and that if he were to get in a wreck and survive, the hospital bills might just finish off what little savings they have left. He also gains a small ray of hope that the doctors may be wrong—that he may somehow beat the death sentence.            To show his realization by a physical act, you can have him go to the garage where he's discarded his wife's present and strap on the helmet. He's really grown here, by this kind of action. He didn't revert to where he was before—he's still going to ride his cycle and he isn't overly afraid to do so—but he's going to do it responsibly now.             See how this physical action stuff works? It's kind of cool, isn't it!            Now. Go out and figure out your own actions to give your characters. Your stories will resonate as they never have before."},

At the invitation of Dr. Martin (Marty! Etchart of Phoenix College for their annual writer's festival, Microburst, I gave a talk to the college's creative writing students and several teachers on Friday and then on Saturday gave a presentation on the film Thelma & Louise, illustrating writing techniques fiction writers can use from the movie.I stayed with my long-time friend, Tom Rough and his lovely wife Lisa and their incredibly smart daughter Nicola, and they showed me an amazing time. I'm posting some of the photos of them and the film presentation. I forgot to bring my camera for the workshop.This morning, I got a call from my friend here in town with whom I have a standing bet that I find an error in the local rag, the Ft. Wayne Journal-Gazette (which I refer to, fondly, as the Journal-Afterthought), and this time it took me less than a minute to find the first mistake. I'm beginning a new award, which I'll call the WHY NEWSPAPERS AREN'T DYING; THEY'RE DEAD, AND HERE'S WHY AWARD. I was a surprised as I'm sure you are that they've earned the first award.Here's what I found in the sports section. I'll highlight the mistake.From the Journal-Afterthought:Would you like to serve as a student reporter for a TinCaps game?Newspaper in Education and the Fort Wayne TinCaps are seeking student reporters for eight summer games. If you are you  interested in bringing your family to a game, interviewing a player, visiting the press box and then writing about the experience, please write a paragraph or more stating why you should be selected and send it to: (blah, blah, blah...)What's really cool about this, is this is part of their project \"Newspaper in Education\" where they use the paper to help \"educate\" schoolkids.  I think they've really earned this award! What I'd suggest to the kids who want to win this student reporter gig is that they turn off their spellcheckers and learn to insert superfluous words in their  text. Heck, they'll probably want to hire the winner as an editor! Anyway, here are some photos from my trip and Microburst.Early arrivals at the Thelma & Louise presentation, grabbing some of the munchies Phoenix College provided.Dr. Martin (Marty) Etchart, director of Microburst and moi, just before we went into a full house to give my presentation. Dr. Etchart has asked me (and I accepted) an invitation to teach creative online classes for Phoenix College and I met several of the students who will be in my classes. Great people!Some of the early audience filing in. When we began, the auditorium was full and a truly great crowd who contributed greatly to our conversation. The building was a Jewish temple the college had purchased and it was perfect for showing a film.Some of the participants during the breaks buying my books, Hooked and Finding Your Voice which the college provided. The bookstore folks who ran it were terrific salespeople and sold a ton of books and I had a ball signing copies....As you can see... The front of my buddy Tom Rough's house. I wanna move in! Tom's the co-owner of Taglio Salon, one of the top salons in the U.S. They employ 50 people, including stylists, colorists, and support personnel. Interesting thing--Tom doesn't talk about his clients very much--a professional thing, but the day I gave the workshop, a woman asked me something about Twilight by Stephanie Meyer, and that night I was talking to Tom and it turns out she's a client in their salon. I didn't even know she lived in Phoenix, but it turns out she's building a home near Tom and Lisa's place. He told me a funny story about something that had just happened in the salon with Ms. Meyer, which I can't repeat. Not that it's bad--it's not--it would just violate professional ethics to disclose something about a client to others. Tom and me on his back patio enjoying a 1984 bottle of something really good (Tom used to own a wine store next to the salon and is a collector and he broke out the good stuff!) and his homemade mac and cheese, followed by incredible steaks. Lisa's taking the shot.Lisa, Tom's wife and incredible hostess! And, the gorgeous mountain that's their backyard view. I wanna move there!Lisa, Nicola and Tom at the parking lot of a national park they took me to which, unfortunately, with my Halfzeimer's, I've forgotten the name of. It had a gorgeous lake, surrounded by mountains and was breathtaking. (Not the parking lot--the stuff all around the parking lot...)Like this...One of Tom's neighbor's houses that I really liked. He lives in Carefree, AZ. A hawk perched on one of the cactus in Tom's back yard.The boulders at the entrance to Tom and Lisa's gated community, named, aptly, \"The Boulders.\" The views and vistas they see every day just blew me away!The boulders from a different view. They're just awesome!A javelina in Tom's back yard. I also saw a coyote sneaking past their yard and didn't get my camera in time to get a shot. Jackrabbits everywhere, roadrunners (beep! beep!), bobcats, mule deer, and all kinds of critters!And the view from their living room out into their back yard. Thanks for everything, Tom, Lisa and Nicola! You guys rock!I just had the most wonderful time I think I've ever had, thanks to the Roughs and Marty and all the folks at Phoenix College!"},

Tom went to Chicago to work for Sassoon's and became the manager there. He went from there to Scottsdale where he co-founded one of the top salons in the southwest, Taglio's. Here's their webpage in case anyone's in the area and wants the best haircut they'll ever get! (http://www.tagliosalon.com/)Anyway, Tom's got an extensive wine collection which he promises we'll put a dent in. Plus, I get to hang with Phoenix writers and the director of Microburst, Martin Etchart, a super writer himself. If anybody here is near the Phoenix area, please try to come to the Thelma & Louise presentation--it's open to the public, while the workshop is composed of students at the college.I'm so looking forward to this trip!I've got my reading material... Linwood Barclay's No Time for Goodbye. I've read this before, but now I'm studying it for tension techniques. I'd highly recommend any of his work for seeing how a master creates tension on the page. In my opinion, he's the best at doing so. You can get it here. No Time for GoodbyeIf I get a chance, I'll try to post stuff while I'm there, but I may (hope!) be too busy to do so.Blue skies,LesAt a Notre Dame game they won last year... (There weren't that many...)P.S. When I go someplace that requires a plane to get there on, I can't help it--feelings of my own frail mortality arise... That's why I'm thankful to Francine P. for giving me this advice....\r<!--\r /* Font Definitions */\r @font-face\r{font-family:\"Cambria Math\";\rpanose-1:2 4 5 3 5 4 6 3 2 4;\rmso-font-charset:1;\rmso-generic-font-family:roman;\rmso-font-format:other;\rmso-font-pitch:variable;\rmso-font-signature:0 0 0 0 0 0;}\r@font-face\r{font-family:Calibri;\rpanose-1:2 15 5 2 2 2 4 3 2 4;\rmso-font-charset:0;\rmso-generic-font-family:swiss;\rmso-font-pitch:variable;\rmso-font-signature:-520092929 1073786111 9 0 415 0;}\r /* Style Definitions */\r p.MsoNormal, li.MsoNormal, div.MsoNormal\r{mso-style-unhide:no;\rmso-style-qformat:yes;\rmso-style-parent:\"\";\rmargin:0in;\rmargin-bottom:.0001pt;\rmso-pagination:widow-orphan;\rfont-size:11.0pt;\rfont-family:\"Calibri\",\"sans-serif\";\rmso-ascii-font-family:Calibri;\rmso-ascii-theme-font:minor-latin;\rmso-fareast-font-family:Calibri;\rmso-fareast-theme-font:minor-latin;\rmso-hansi-font-family:Calibri;\rmso-hansi-theme-font:minor-latin;\rmso-bidi-font-family:\"Times New Roman\";\rmso-bidi-theme-font:minor-bidi;}\r.MsoChpDefault\r{mso-style-type:export-only;\rmso-default-props:yes;\rmso-ascii-font-family:Calibri;\rmso-ascii-theme-font:minor-latin;\rmso-fareast-font-family:Calibri;\rmso-fareast-theme-font:minor-latin;\rmso-hansi-font-family:Calibri;\rmso-hansi-theme-font:minor-latin;\rmso-bidi-font-family:\"Times New Roman\";\rmso-bidi-theme-font:minor-bidi;}\r@page Section1\r{size:8.5in 11.0in;\rmargin:1.0in 1.0in 1.0in 1.0in;\rmso-header-margin:.5in;\rmso-footer-margin:.5in;\rmso-paper-source:0;}\rdiv.Section1\r{page:Section1;}\r-->\r  I want to die in my sleep like my grandfather.

Dumb plot twists and incorrect “facts” are killers when it comes to destroying the fictive dream for a reader.A single error in a book or a film can destroy the entire credibility of the work. The second-worst thing a writer can experience is an editor finding such an error in a manuscript. The worst? Having a reader find such an error. That means the editor missed it and virtually nothing makes those folks angrier. Kind of embarrasses them.Even though the rest of the book may be perfect, the reader will have doubts about the integrity of all of it if he or she finds a single error. I’m going to go over just a few of the ones I’ve seen (no room to list them all!) and it would be kind of cool if others would share the ones they’ve spotted and that bother them.A couple of years ago, I was sitting on a panel at the annual Writer’s Festival of Literary Arts in Aurora, Illinois, next to one of my favorite writers. I won’t name him as it’s not my intent to cause anyone embarrassment, but if he reads this, he’ll know it’s him. This was an extremely well-known writer, whose every book lands at the top of the NY Times bestseller list.While we were waiting for the audience to file in, we were talking and I mentioned I’d just read his latest mega-seller. I hesitated, but then decided to pass on what I’d read. He’d had a military man communicating with another military man via radio telephone, and he’d had the guy say, at the end of their transmission, “Over and out.”“______,” I said. “You know there’s a glaring mistake in your book.” I pointed out the “over and out” dialog. “That’s impossible,” I said. “No military man would ever, in a million years, say that. ’Over’ means, ‘invitation to transmit,’ while ‘out’ means, ‘transmission over.’ You can’t issue an invitation to transmit and then say the transmission is over. I hate to say it, but I’ve only ever seen that in bad movies.” An amateur might have said something like that, but never a bona fide military man.He was shocked. “You know,” he said. “I know that. And, I had a military man vet my book! He never caught it.” I didn’t say anything to the writer, but I can’t imagine a military man letting that get by. Must have been in the Reserves, I figured. A “real” military veteran would have caught it in a heartbeat. And, he couldn’t blame the proofreader entirely. After all, he was the one who’d written it.The upshot was the writer thanked me, and said he’d have it corrected in future editions and that he’d never hire this guy to proof any of his material ever again. He was embarrassed and I would have been, too. He’s a literary star and so that one glitch won’t prevent him from selling future books, but if this had been his first novel, it very well could have harmed him greatly.Recently, I read a novel by another suspense/thriller writer acquaintance—again, a top bestselling writer who even has a writing how-to book out there, and found several serious errors in this novel. First, he had a character looking at a piece of handwriting and saying that it looked “masculine.” That’s impossible. There are three things that handwriting can’t reveal. Age, sex or handedness (if the writer is left-or right-handed) cannot be revealed by handwriting. Laypeople, who haven’t studied handwriting analysis or graphology, subscribe to myths like this, but it just ain’t so. You absolutely cannot tell any of those three things from handwriting. Later on, he compounded the error by having the same character, looking again at the handwriting sample, and saying it “looked like an older man” had written it because it looked “waverly.” Again, not possible to tell a person’s age by their handwriting.Two glaring errors, based on the same thing. The third error, however, was the most egregious. This same character finds the body of his deceased wife who had disappeared two years previously, and he’s upset because her hair was longer than he’d liked it before she was murdered. It was longer, the character says, because “hair grows after death.” The first two mistakes I could possibly understand—there are many misconceptions about handwriting among laypeople—although, it would have been fairly easy to research and correct this—but this last one is one of the hoariest of all old wives’ tales—that hair “grows” after death. That’s been disproved about… oh… maybe a couple of hundred years ago? That it sometimes “appears” to have grown after death is simply the result of body tissues shrinking in decomposition, sometimes giving it the illusion of having grown. Any eighth-grade biology student could have told my author friend that. Any funeral director or even the lowest of employees in a funeral home could have told him that. Well, for me, reading this guy is over. A single mistake can be excused, like the first author I mentioned. When I see three in one book, as much as I like this guy, there’s no way I’ll ever be able to believe his characters again. He’s simply too sloppy in his research. And he has a doctorate and even taught in a prestigious school. If he’d only asked a kid about some of his facts…There’s a huge error in a popular movie that drives me crazy and because of this error, I’ve never seen the ending of the movie. I just couldn’t believe the rest of it once I’d seen this mistake. My level of believability was completely destroyed. The fictive dream had been utterly destroyed.The movie? Dances With Wolves. In a scene about a third of the way through, Indian boys steal Kevin Costner’s horse and are fleeing with it and chattering elatedly among themselves. Convenient subtitles are provided as they’re speaking in their native tongues. One of the boys says, “They’ll write songs about us!” I emphasized the word because this was one of the dumbest things I’ve ever seen in dialog, book or movie. The thing is, Native Americans not only don’t have a word for “writing” in any of their languages; they don’t even have a concept of writing. If these boys had been raised, say, on a reservation and gone to a reservation school, yeah, perhaps they would have learned the concept of writing, but these were true aboriginals and had never been exposed to writing in any form. In fact, the only contact the entire tribe had ever had with a white person was with the love interest, whatever her name was—a now-adult woman who had been captured years ago when she was a child when the tribe killed her family.If the Indian boy had only shouted out, “They’ll sing songs about us!” it would have worked and been believable. The instant he used the word “write” it was all over for me. I looked up the original script and the screenwriter had it right. He’d written that they’d sang songs, properly. Whoever rewrote the subtitle or had ordered it rewritten was the one who was the dummy. For this one, I’ll blame the director, the editor, and whoever rewrote the original screenwriter’s screenplay. But, from that moment on, I didn’t believe anything in the movie.The other thing that will cause me to walk out of a movie or close a book, never to return, are “idiot plot twists.” There’s a truly awful movie that was released in theaters and then made it to TV re-run land that still shows up on the tube now and again. I saw it in the theater and actually walked out. It wasn’t until it turned up on television that I ever saw the end.I can’t recall the title (it was so horrible I’ve sublimated that knowledge), but the premise is that, for some reason, this couple who are either man and wife or romantically entangled, find themselves in this new-fangled office building with a nifty new security system. The entire building shuts down on Friday evenings and doesn’t open up until Monday morning. No one can possibly get in or out during this time. Again, I can’t remember why, but this couple finds themselves trapped in the building and know they can’t get out until Monday morning. No big deal—they can survive on candy bars and sodas from the vending machines. Except… there’s a bad guy in the building with them and his mission is to render the pair room temperature. Again, I forget why this guy wants to dust them, but he does. It’s not important to the story why.Anyway, the first third of the movie involves setting up the situation and the bad guy trying to catch and kill the  dude and his babe. So far, so good. There’s no doubt in the man and woman’s minds that this guy wants to ice them. He’s chased them all over the building—up and down elevator shafts, through various rooms and different levels, etc. He comes close a few times, but they always manage to escape in the nick of time. And then… The plucky couple race into a huge room that’s being remodeled, just ahead of the bad dude. There are piles of lumber and all kinds of tools lying around. The man grabs some big tool—a nail driver or something—and the dynamic duo hide behind a pile of lumber. The bad guy enters the room, and the two hold their breath, and eventually the bad guy comes around the corner of the lumber pile and… POW! The good guy lays him out with the power tool. Knocks him cold as a mackerel, to use a cliché I, for one, never get too tired of hearing.Movie over, right?Not quite.At this point, the question the writer of this opus needs to ask him- or herself, what would a logical person do now? This is the standard all writers need to ask themselves throughout the writing of their stories. Their protagonist should act the way a person of at least average intelligence would act. I use this movie for an example in many of my classes and ask the students what they would do if they were this man and woman. The situation is: The good guys have knocked out and disabled the bad guy. It’s just Saturday and they have to remain in the building until Monday to escape.Here’s the typical answers college students give:1. Kill the bad guy.2. Tie him up. (Remember, this is a building site with all kinds of materials at hand.)3. Take turns guarding him while the other sleeps and when he wakes up, knock him out again.Other variations of the same thing. Makes sense, right? If you have a moral thing about killing somebody, just tie him up or keep knocking him out. If you have no compunctions about killing someone that was trying to kill you, just bash his brains in.Okay. What did these two geniuses do? Sit down—you’re not going to believe this.They drop the nail gun and run away to hide somewhere else.I’m not making this up. I wish I was.This is an idiot plot twist—just written to keep the chase and the movie going. I actually walked out of the theater at this point and demanded my money back. And got it.These two people deserve to die at this point. It’s obvious they’re from the low end of the gene pool and the danger is they may have offspring and there’s that genetics thing. Their kiddies may well grow up to be as stupid or stupider than they are and the bad thing is… they’ll be out there in society with us! Driving cars… If that doesn’t scare you, nothing will.This is a moron plot, akin to those “John Wayne cavalry finishes,” of yesteryear’s godawful movies. Where the wagon train is surrounded by murderous redskins who are about to lift their scalps and… at the last possible second, over the ridge comes John Wayne with the cavalry!Actually, this is an even worse plot than that. This is unparalleled stupidity of the nth order.When I finally watched the end of this turkey on TV, it turned out pretty much the way I figured. Their “escapes” from the bad guy came closer and closer and they were everywhere in this building, up and down elevator shafts, out on ledges thirty stories above the street, all that kind of melodramatic crap as you’d expect from this kind of Hollyweird baloney. I don’t remember the exact ending—I’m sure they escaped at the end through some kind of miracle move and with a lot of FX and expertly-applied makeup to show their wounds. Doesn’t matter. You begin rooting for the bad guy as soon as they leave him and run away to hide. At least he’s got some smarts. At least if he catches and kills them, it’ll prevent them from breeding and that would be a major blessing to mankind in general. Do you really want idiots like this driving cars on your block or handling power tools like chainsaws in your immediate vicinity?This kind of plot is why I don’t watch teenage horror movies. I don’t see most of them as horror, but more as broad comedies.Look at some of these things. There’s a bad guy who stands about 6’8” and is always dripping with blood and wears a hockey mask. The police force in the burg he always lives in can’t catch this guy. Even Barney Fife would catch a guy this obvious, I think. Does he just look like most of the other citizens? Doesn’t he ever have to go to the local 7-11 for a loaf of bread occasionally? I mean, he never looks a bit different in all 13 movies…And then, this group of college kids arrives at the Dismal Swamp Resort. When all the other kids in America go to Florida, this group of geniuses opts for a weedy lake, crawling with leeches and  in the middle of nowhere. There’s a clue right there that these aren’t Rhodes scholars…And then, five minutes into the movie, one of the comely coeds in short-shorts, goes to take a leak and finds a head floating in the toilet. She lets out a shriek and they all come running, but about five minutes later, everything’s pretty much back to normal. How, exactly, does she think that head got there? The guy was barfing and the lid fell on him? But, they all go back to normal except they’re “kind of” worried about things. At this point, and every point thereafter, all this brainy band need to do is to pile into their Land Rover and drive away, maybe call the state troopers. But then… the movie would be over. Can’t let that happen!Moron plot twists…One by one, the evil guy knocks the merry band of anal retentives over until there’s only one left. The blondest blonde with the shortest shorts… natch. He’s saving the best morsel for last… Again, long ago we began rooting for the bad guy. He’s the only one with at least a double-digit I.Q. These “leaders of tomorrow” for sure don’t have brainpower even close to his.This is when it really gets funny. The bad guy—remember, he’s about 6’8” and can’t run for shit—he kind of looks like Lurch, stumbling along—is outrunning the frisky little filly of a coed who is flat-out flying…and he catches her! A miracle! How on earth did he ever do it? She must be running in circles like rabbits do. Come to think of it, there are an awful lot of movies where the victim runs as fast or even much faster than the bad guy, but somehow the bad guy manages to catch them… Kind of a Hollywood tradition…Like I said, most horror movies are comedies.Does this sound a bit anal? Am I a bit harsh in my judgment? Perhaps so, but I don’t apologize. The main tools we have as writers are words and stories that make sense and if writers are sloppy in their usage, then I’m not going to purchase their products any more. This attitude drives my wife Mary nuts, sometimes. I’ll quit eating at a restaurant if they misspell words on their marquee. I figure if they’re this sloppy about the language, what goes on in the kitchen? I don’t want to take the chance.This kind of stuff goes on everywhere and it seems to me as if it’s increasing. Take newspapers, these days.We have two newspapers in town. The morning paper, The (Ft. Wayne, IN) Journal-Gazette is a joke. I’ve had a standing bet with a friend for years that he can call me on any day of the year and within five minutes I can find an error in the paper—spelling, usage, punctuation, syntax, whatever. He’s phoned me over the past ten years perhaps thirty times and I’ve never lost the bet. He could have called me every single day for the past ten (or longer) years and I wouldn’t have lost the bet. I won’t place the same wager for our evening newspaper, The News-Sentinel. I’ve never once seen a mistake in it. Not a single time. I’m not saying they don’t make errors, just that I’ve been unable to find one. Which paper do you think I trust for the news? What’s a tragedy is that the Journal-Gazette (which I fondly refer to as the “Journal-Afterthought, as I’ve read all of their news at least a day before online and is why newspapers aren’t dying; they’re already dead) participates in a thing called “Newspapers in Education.” They promote their rag as an instrument in the public schools. (The private schools have more sense. They want their students to actually succeed in college…)The thing is, if a book has a glaring error, it’s pretty good evidence that the reader can’t trust the writer. I’d give that writer one chance. If it happens again, there are plenty of other writers I’ll support with my dollars instead who do take the time and expend the energy to get things right. It’s the only way I can vote on the subject. And, even though it seems people think we have more knowledge these days readily available on the Internet, it also seems to me that more books have incorrect facts like this than they did years ago. And movies… well, that’s Hollywood, where Harvard MBA’s run the show. I wouldn’t expect them to be accurate… I’ve seen too many Oliver Stone and James Cameron movies to think otherwise…How about you folks? Have you experienced something like my examples that turned you off to a writer or a film? Or maybe you’re not as anal as I am and you don’t care? I’d like to hear from both sides."},

And, some of it is my own, and most of this can be found in my two writing books. Cover of Flatmancrooked in which I had a story.  There are two basic building blocks that make up all stories.Scenes.Sequels. That's it. Once you know how to construct scenes and their sequels you've mastered stories.To do so, you need to know five things:1. How to plan a scene2. How to plan a sequel3. How to write a scene4. How to write a sequel5. How to use them togetherFirst what is a scene? A scene is nothing more than a unit of conflict lived through by the character and the reader.All of the big moments in your story are scenes or at least they should be. If you want something to assume importance to the reader, you have to cast it in scene form.Second, what is a sequel? All a sequel is is a unit of transition that links two scenes.     Here's how you handle them:The framework of a scene is merely a blow-by-blow account of somebody's time-unified effort to attain an immediate goal despite head-to-head opposition. That's it. There are two functions of scenes, one, to provide interest and two, to move your story forward.       Providing interest.       Because it pits your focal character against opposition, raising the question to the reader of will this character win or won't (s)he?        Example: John is trying to get a date with Marsha. It's near closing time in a nightclub. Will John get the date...or will she turn him down?Moving a story forward.It changes your focal character's situation and while change doesn't always constitute progress, progress always involves change. In our dating situation, our protagonist is in a far different situation if he's turned down than he was at the beginning of the round. Also true if he succeeds in getting a date from Marsha.What unifies a scene? Time. You live through a scene and there are no breaks in the flow of time. Once the bell rings, there's no time out for the fighter. Until the bell rings again, he has to stand and take his lumps - minute by minute, blow by blow. No place here for flashbacks or anything that will divert from the action and tension of the scene.Scene structure is very simple. It consists of:A. Goal B. ConflictC. Disaster (It has to end in disaster or that's the end of the story)Here's how it works. Take our paramour, John. His goal is to obtain a date from Marsha. Marsha has a goal, too. To keep him from obtaining a date too easily, lest she be thought of as \"easy\". Remember, all major characters in scenes have goals - not just the main character or protagonist.,John introduces himself, delivers a bon mot. Marsha laughs, in spite of herself. John smiles in triumph. When he does, a piece of spinach appears in his front teeth. Marsha points it out, making a joke. Embarrassed to death, John tries to come back with another witty remark, but his confidence is shot and his remark is weak. She sneers, walks away. Disaster.Goal - conflict - disaster. All the parts are there. It's a scene.Let's make it more complicated.John walks into a nightclub and approaches Marsha. He has a goal. He wants something. Something always falls into one of three categories:A. Possession of something...a girl, a job, money, whatever. B. Relief from something...blackmail, domination, fear.C. Revenge for something...a snub, a betrayal, a loss.In this case, John wants a date with Marsha. But how does he propose going about achieving this goal?Here's an important point: A goal is not a goal until it's specific and concrete and immediate enough for the character to take some sort of action toward achieving it. The essence of goal choice is a decision to act by your character. And, ideally, this decision should focus on a target so exact that you could photograph your character performing the act to which (s)he aspires. If you can't, the goal isn't specific enough. To \"win love\" as a goal is weak. Can't photograph \"love.\"  \"To get Marsha into bed\" is much stronger. You can photograph someone having sex. Or kissing, if you prefer a less-explicit photograph for this instance. This is one of the biggest tips I can ever give for making scenes strong. Make the goal of your character in the scene something you can photograph. A goal this sharply defined will always sharpen up the way you write it. Truth.John's goal is to take Marsha out to the Grateful Dead concert tomorrow. (I know, I know...that dates me...) There, aided by the adrenaline created by the flashing lights and music, he hopes to get her into the sack.Enter conflict.Conflict is just another name for opposition. A character trying to walk through a brick wall. It's an irresistible force meeting an immovable object - two forces trying to gain mutually incompatible goals. For one to win, the other must lose.First, he states his case. In this instance, by flirting. The reader needs to know what your hero proposes to attempt. Or at least that he proposes to attempt something. If no attempt is made, there can be no struggle.If Marsha is as eager for the date as John is, you have no conflict - no reader-intriguing, interest-provoking question of who wins and who loses. Therefore...no scene.So we make Marsha not laugh at his witticism. It seems she's got her eye on somebody else in the nightclub.And that means John is going to have to fight to win his goal.John asks her, point-blank, if she'll go to the concert with him.She tells him she'll think about it.If he takes no for an answer easily, we can assume one of two things. Either he didn't really want the date very much after all, or, he lacks the strength of character to fight for what he wants...which means he's weak and ineffectual and why should anyone give a darn what happens to a character like that?But, let's make John strong and he does want the date. So he fights, using anything and everything in his arsenal.Finally, Marsha agrees. Cool, right?No. Not cool. We've made it too easy for him. The conflict is too limited and the scene too soon ended.So maybe they can argue some more?No. Endless arguing quickly becomes mind-numbing and boring.What to do? Answer - bring in additional external difficulties related to the situation. Offer new developments, more complications. Make it harder for John to win. Build up the opposition to his goal.The guy Marsha has her eye on walks over and begins talking to her. She warms to him immediately. Now you've got a scene that's really cooking. John has to fight harder. He remembers something. Marsha has mentioned in their conversation--she loves dancing. He's seen the new suitor dancing earlier and he's terrible. He asks her to dance. She hesitates; clearly she wants the new guy (let's call him Rocky) to ask her instead. But, Rocky hesitates himself (he knows he's a lousy dancer) and she reluctantly agrees to the next dance with John.Do you see how much more meat this scene now has? A new complication (Rocky) has upped the stakes, provided new opposition. John (as any worthy protagonist would) doesn't give up at this, but renews his efforts, searches for a way to defeat his opponent (and that has to come from something within himself, not from outside forces helping him).At this point in our scene, things are looking up for John. He knows he's going to wow her on the dance floor, turn the tide in his favor. Those three years of dance lessons are finally going to pay off! At this point, the smart writer introduces something new.Disaster. Disaster is a hook. And a hook is a device for catching, holding, sustaining, or pulling anything - in this case, your reader.To this end, a disaster offers a logical but unanticipated development that throws John for a loss. Something happens to put him behind the eight-ball.On the way to the dance floor, John trips over something and twists his ankle. Disaster. Rocky sees this, comes rushing up, takes Marsha's arm and leads her onto the dance floor. John has lost. The scene ends in disaster. But not entirely. You are probably wondering, \"does a scene always have to end in disaster?\" Yes. Except for the final scene in the book and that can go either way - success or disaster and success usually works the best as that's when the reader has followed John for page after page of failures...and then he finally triumphs. But it must also do something else. It must raise an intriguing question for the future. A question designed to keep your reader reading. You're almost at the end of this scene but not quite. John is laying there with his twisted ankle, his goal lost (temporarily). As he limps off the floor, he determines that he will return when his ankle has rested up for a few minutes and have that dance with her. He's lost, for the moment, but you've created incredible tension for the reader who is going to read on to see if later on he does indeed, return, dance with her and win a date. See how that works?A scene is a tool that makes the most of conflict. It organizes the conflict elements, then telescopes them and intensifies them. Without this, the prose lies flat and wooden upon the page.Your next logical question is, \"is that everything in a story - scenes?\"No. What's remaining is sequel. I'll get to that later. But first, let's look at some things that cause scenes to fail.1. The orientation is muddled.                   The reader has to know where (s)he stands. Which means (s)he needs a character to serve as compass. Even if your focal character isn't on stage, the scene still must have a focal or pov character.2. The focal character's goal is weak.It's not sufficiently specific and concrete. The remedy? One, keep the goal a short-term proposition. Make it something the focal character can logically achieve in a relatively limited, time-unified, face-to-face encounter. Two, be ruthless in forcing yourself to reduce the goal to a single, photographable act. Keep the goal the target the character shoots for and as such keep it the center of attention in the scene. Other goals may present themselves - another girl may appear who seems to like John. Temporarily, this may distract him. But you absolutely have to keep other targets such as this to a subordinate level or your scene will swerve off course immediately.3. The character himself is weak.Why doesn't he quit is the key phrase here. If enough is at stake for him, he'll fight. The reader has to know that this date with Marsha is something he desperately wants and will fight for.4. The scene lacks urgency.And what's urgency? Time pressure. Which means there must be some reason for John to act to attain his goal right now. The concert is tomorrow night. This means John has to act now.Urgency.5. The opposition is diffuse.A swarm of anopheles mosquitoes may prove more dangerous than a rabid dog, but the dog offers unified and obvious menace and that's why a lot more people come down with malaria than are bitten by rabid dogs. It's also the reason why unified opposition is more useful in building reader interest than is fragmented opposition. You don't want four guys bidding for Marsha's interest; you want one. Rocky. Small, annoying oppositions wear our your focal character rather than overwhelming him. But heroism lies in striking back and your character needs one central figure he can defeat and thus resolve his problem. A single villain. Broad social injustices may well be at the root of your hero's problem, but the reader won't much care unless you personify them in the person of one individual that represents those forces.6. The opposition is weak.The strength of your antagonist is the strength of your story. Write this down! Writers who lack confidence in their protagonists, sometimes try to solve the problem by making their antagonist weak. This translates into weak scenes and an unpublishable and boring book. The only remedy is to create a powerful antagonist. Under stress, your protagonist may prove hardier than you think.7. The scene is fragmentary or trivialIt exhibits a lack of adequate external development. If someone spills a drink on John's trousers, that isn't enough meat to build a scene upon, unless it leads to further complications.8. The scene is monotonous.Same problem as 7. The key symptom here is a tendency of your characters to go over and over the same ground, haggling, arguing and rehashing the same issues endlessly. How to solve? A. Throw in more external development. Throw in an unexpected twist. B. Give the characters more diversity. Extra facets and modifying traits will keep them from growing dull and predictable.9. The disaster isn't indigenous to the scene.A disaster should be unanticipated, yet logical. It means that it should grow out of your material. Not acts of God, etc. What I keep referring to as \"John Wayne cavalry rescues.\" A drunk could have wandered onto the dance floor and knocked John out as he was dancing. But the drunk would have little relationship to the story beyond mere complication and readers draw more satisfaction from motivated action.Now. Sequels.A sequel is a unit of transition that links two scenes. It gives the reader your focal character's reaction to the scene just completed and provides him with motivation for the scene next to come. It has three functions.1. To translate disaster into goal.2. To telescope reality.3. To control tempo.It translates disaster into goal by providing a bridge that gives your character a plausible reason to strike out in a particular direction that will bring the character into further conflict.John faces what's happened. He's been defeated. So, should he give up the chase for Marsha? Should he seek out someone else to take to the concert? Should he just forget the whole thing and resign himself to masturbation? The possibilities are endless. Yet, only when he reaches a decision as to which road to take can your story proceed logically. This is one of the jobs of the sequel. The decision-making area - the bridge from one scene to the next. Remember, a scene is a unit of conflict. The reader reads through it because (s)he likes to live through a struggle to find an answer to the implied question of who wins and who loses. But, sooner or later, every battle ends - on a hook, a question, a disaster. Your reader is eager to find out what happens next. (S)he wants that moment when your story forces once again come into conflict. And this is where you have to be careful. Conflict for conflict's sake isn't enough, simply because it's meaningless. It carries no clear-cut cause-effect relationship to what's happened before. The reader demands that your character's efforts have meaning. They must be the product of what's happened before and they must also be the product of intelligence and direction. Without logic and plausibility all the tension is lost. Fiction is concocted on a suspension of disbelief. If your story people act irrationally or without cause, the reader's intelligence is insulted and (s)he'll quit reading. And this is where sequel comes in. Implicitly or explicitly it reveals how your focal character chooses his or her new course of action. It tells your reader this is a sensible person, one (s)he can accept and get behind. Sequel traces your characters chain of logic, how he rationalizes what's just happened. Therefore, sequel is aftermath. As such, it telescopes reality. Making a decision may take time and it may demand movement. Often, it calls for the introduction of new material, even undramatic material...to help your character decide what to do next. Consider John. It may take an hour for him to make up his mind what he wants to do. Presented in detail, such a time lapse in this case of even an hour will bog down your story. You could show him getting a couple of drinks, talking to other girls, attending to his ankle, etc. But, you'd lose the reader. This is a time for summary. It's telling, not showing, and believe it or not, there's a place for telling in a story. This is that time. Using summary, you telescope the events of that hour. And that controls tempo. A story is a series of peaks and valleys - big moments and small. It's not a continuing climax. The sequel allows the reader to gather his or her thoughts and relax a bit before the next scene. It's in sequel you work for tone and mood and capture the flavor of John's life. You slow down here to control the tempo.What unifies sequel and holds it together? Topic. Topic is the subject of a discourse or any section of it. The subject of our story here is John's reaction to his plight with Marsha. It's his preoccupation with the problem the preceding scene posed. It says in effect, \"I've been defeated, humiliated, overcome by a disaster. What can I do now?\" With that preoccupation riding him, John works out an answer. Then he pinpoints it in a decision to attack a new goal. Therefore, sequel has a 1-2-3 structure.1. Reaction2. Dilemma3. DecisionHere's how that works. Let's build a sequel to John's defeat. He sees Rocky and Marsha on the dance floor, and Marsha looks deliriously happy. Another blow to John. He questions why he would even want to date her when she's so infatuated with another man. He wonders if he should just quit. But then, he remembers something about Marsha, how her eyes softened when he first approached her. He senses that if he just does the right thing, he can win her affection. He thinks through what he knows. He knows Rocky's a lout. The problem is, Marsha doesn't seem to realize that. How can he make her see the difference between them? He  makes his mind up to ask her to dance. He knows she loves to dance and he can see Rocky's terrible at it. That's the key to success, he thinks. His ankle feels better. The song ends and he walks toward the dance floor as another song begins...and Rocky sees him, grabs Marsha and begins dancing with her again. John turns away, eminent defeat staring him in the eyes...when...he spots another girl (Helen), an old friend he's danced with many times. Who just happens to be a great dancer and they dance well together. He considers a new plan. Why not dance with Helen? When Marsha sees how well he dances... He hurries over to Helen. He's made a decision. First step - impress Marsha. It's a new goal for John to strive toward. And count on it, conflict will inevitably follow. At least it will if we make proper use of our scene pattern. Reaction...dilemma...decision. All the parts are there. It's a sequel.And we're off to a new scene.Now, sometimes there can be longer sequels. Maybe (probably) this doesn't work and time has run out - the club closes. This may call for a longer sequel until John can once again pursue Marsha. Maybe she leaves with Rocky. Now, instead of an hour, he has almost a full day to convince her to go to the concert with him. There's still that element of time to create tension, but there's a bit more of it. Now John can go into flashback if that's needed to show the reader why he's so enamored of Marsha to begin with. He can do a lot of things here, but over it all you have to maintain the tension of time evaporating for the fulfillment of his goal. Sequels are the places for summary, flashback, telling instead of showing, etc.Finally, you need to integrate scene and sequel. They must complement each other and link together smoothly into that unified cohesive whole we know as story. Here's how.1. You control story pacing by how you proportion scene to sequel. Big scenes equal big interest. Long sequels, in turn, tend to indicate strong plausibility. You must decide which element is most important to you at each given point. Blood and guts melodrama may jump from death threat to fistfight to rape to ambush, virtually without sequel. It's all conflict; no transition. Doesn't work. Characterization, the most important element, is lost. On the other hand, the narrative can reside solely in the character's mind and the only hint of strife is when he raises his eyebrows at his wife's snotty remark. Bo---ring. A story needs both drama and introspection. Action reveals character...or at least it should. Simply put, a scene encompasses overt action (don't mean here the layperson's definition of \"action\" but the literary one.) and the sequel deals with the protagonist's reaction to what just happened in the scene, which poses a new dilemma to him and ends with a decision on how to deal with the new dilemma...and a new scene...leading up to what appears to be a victory, but ends in a new disaster...which leads to a new possibility as the character enters sequel where the character reacts to what just happened, which poses a new dilemma and ends with a decision on how to deal with that...and a new scene....and so on.And everything increases as the novel or story moves toward a final climax.Hope this helps!"},

It’s always the first lesson I give in both online and “on-ground” creative writing classes. I decided to post this because recently, on another forum, I’ve been seeing a lot of conversations based on outlining. What I’ve observed from their remarks is that the great majority have only experienced one kind of outline—that old composition thing with the Roman numerals that go on for pages… What I’m going to show here is a very different kind of outline. One that makes sense. Is infinitely simpler and actually works.Let’s cover some history first…Like a lot of writers, I wasted a lot of time in my writing career simply because I ignored what is probably the biggest \"secret\" in creating short stories and novels. I didn't outline.Outlines were a particular type of hell English teachers visited upon you - those horrid things with Roman numerals and topics and subtopics and all that junk. Yuch! Outlining took all the fun out of reading a book.I also read interviews with writers who said they never outlined. It would destroy their \"creativity\" many claimed. The way to write a story was to create a character, start them out in trouble and kind of follow them around as they had neat adventures. What it took years to realize was that my characters had great adventures and it was kind of fun following them around...until somewhere between pages eight and twenty when they would peter out. I had a drawerful of some of the best starts of stories you ever saw. Problem was, they never went anywhere. And most of them never came close to an ending. Oh, a few did, the really short ones. There were even one or two that came to a respectable length...after rewriting them twenty times.What I didn't realize for the longest time was that writing involves the processing and integration of large blocks of trivial bits of information. As the length of my stories grew, so did the complexity. All of a sudden, I was on page thirteen and I suddenly remembered I couldn't have my character chase the bad guy...because on page two I'd given him bronchia asthma. I had to go back and \"cure\" him. What I didn't realize was something pretty obvious. A story, like the life it represents, is basically complex. Stories aren't built like a line of dominoes, it more resembles a web, and when you tug a bit harder on one of its many strands, the whole business vibrates. And changes shape. Not only did I have to remember the many details and their connections, I had to keep them in a logical order. Virtually impossible.I even managed to write several books in this manner. Looking back on those days I cringe. What an awful lot of energy I needlessly wasted!Here was my typical process. I bet at least some of you have gone through the same procedure. I'd get a great idea, so great that I'd have to drop the baby if I was holding him, and fly to my typewriter. (Remember - this was in the days of yore when they had those ancient artifacts...) As fast as my fingers could fly, I'd write. A hundred words would accumulate. Then, two hundred. Then...well, then I began to run into problems.Something I did in the first hundred words didn't quite fit with the three hundredth, but I wasn't quite sure what it was. Something was just \"off\". It would bother and confuse me, but I didn't want to deal with it. So, I'd push on, fix it later, whatever it was. Just get the stuff out, in the white heat of creativity. That's what rewriting was for, right? To fix stuff that didn't fit.Only now the writing really slowed. The next fifty words were the hardest. I was running out of steam. The idea I'd begun with seemed stale, trite. If I could even remember the original idea. Crap! I'd say, finally, slamming shut the typewriter case. Maybe tomorrow the Muse would redescend...Hardly ever happened. On the morrow, a new idea would strike, with the same kind of heat as the first one and I'd be off and running with that one.With the same results.In no time at all, I had boxes of unfinished stories. Sound familiar?Well, I learned a trick. I won't go through the whole sorry history of how I wasted time and learned, little by little, to work smarter. What happened, after many centuries (well, it seems like that now) was that I began kind of jotting down a half page of notes. I even began figuring out my endings before I began.Now I began to finish stories. Not a lot, but a lot more than I had previously. After a couple of years of this, I began to expand my notes. Never once did I think of what I was doing as \"outlining.\" There weren't any Roman numeral. How could that be an outline?And then...one day I got one of those Joycean epiphanies. What I was doing was an outline! But, these weren't outlines like Missus Grundy had us doing back in P.S. 121. These were just notes. Notes kind of organized. And I discovered something else. Those old writers were liars. Hemingway, Steinbeck and Shakespeare - they all claimed they didn't outline, but they had to. Their stuff all held the kind of integrity that only comes in thinking through a project first before you pick up the saw. They just said they didn't outline. All of a sudden, I knew better. Those guys probably didn't think they outlined either. I doubt if any of them had Roman numerals on their notes either. I'd bet money they had notes, though, and copious notes...and copious notes organized into some kind of system. Before they ever picked up the ol' writing quill and wrote \"Chapter One\". Probably what a lot of them did was write a first draft...and then used that for their \"outline\". Without calling it that, of course, or even thinking of it in that way. Hemingway didn’t outline—he had 80,000 word outlines (also called a “first draft). Same thing, just a bit cumbersome and time-consuming to create. I bet that's what they did though. They weren't any different than I was. Or you. If any writer begins their story without knowing precisely where they're going, any mistakes they make at first, any tiny omissions, take on added significance as he or she proceeds. As length grows linearly, complexity expands exponentially. Fact of life. The writing life anyway.If one is muleheaded enough, a story can be bulled through without outlining. Even fairly long stories. It's kind of a masochistic exercise though. It may take twenty, even thirty rewrites to get a decent story that way.Don't ask me how I know this. I'll begin crying. I'll have to. My wife knows I recall experiences like this and keeps all the sharp instruments locked up.Novels are the worst experience in the world without an outline. After you spend several years learning to juggle thousands of details in your head - you can get pretty good at it - you can write longer and longer material. Except, that no matter how good you get at retaining all this stuff in your head, you'll probably end up stuck on about page ninety. That seems to be the magic length for novels. Not quite long enough by about three hundred pages. Short stories seem to peter out around between pages six to eight.If you've got an outline you just don't have these problems. Stuck? Glance up at your outline and instantly you'll be reminded where you are in the story and your perspective will return. The dizzy feeling will recede.Okay. Sales pitch for outlines over. I learned my technique from taking screenplay writing classes. Those guys always outline. That's how they can write scripts so quickly. I took a class in this program with Martin Goldstein and I wrote a 108-page script in two days. And Mr. Goldstein says it's a great script - has attached himself to it as the producer and not only that - this \"two-day\" script was just named a semifinalist in the Academy Foundation's Nicholl’s Fellowships in Screenwriting awards. Not bad for two days work! I wrote the first 64 pages in about eight hours and the remaining 44 pages in about ten hours. Piece of cake. Of course, I spent about a week and a half on the outline. I do write quickly, so don't use my times as a model. Without an outline, I'd still be writing...Let's get to these puppies. Here's how you create an outline for your story. Ready?1. You make notes to yourself as you imagine the story played out.2. You arrange those notes.3. As the writing proceeds, you refer to them.That's it. Or so I thought at the time. It was a lot easier than what I used to do, but there was still something I was to learn.I got lucky. I happened on a book that really opened my eyes as far as outlines. I honestly can’t remember the book—I’ve got thousands and thousands and thousands of books, literally—and I wish I could so I could give the author his proper credit (I do remember it was a man), but he gave me the best outlining tool I’ve ever come across. It’s nothing at all like those ten-pound puppies with the Roman numerals as you’ll see.The outline I propose you try that I took from this guy’s book on writing consists of five simple statements that describe the major actions through which the story will be told. One statement for each major focus. And each statement will be short, consisting only of two to three words. A human noun, a strong, concrete action verb, and (most of the time) a direct object. (We won't count articles such as \"a\", \"an\", and \"the\" as words.) The simpler an outline is the more it focuses on the important relationships in your story. Words actually count for more in an outline than in the story. An outline like I'm proposing should have no more than fifteen to twenty words in it. Twenty words max for a 400-page novel. In a story, the almost-right word can sometimes suffice, but in an outline, it has to be the perfect word. Another difference between this version of an outline and the ones Missus Grundy had you do is that the statements in her outlines represented topic sentences and as such specify what comes at the beginning of the section they represent. That's because in logical writing, the writer states her premise first and then develops it.In dramatic stories, however, the dramatic action that makes your point comes at the end of each section - where climaxes belong. What this means is that your outline statements represent endings, not beginnings. This is an important point to keep in mind. This is ultra-important to grasp. I’ll say it again: Your outline statements represent endings, not beginnings. I think this is why we hate those old Comp I kinds of outlines. It doesn’t allow any room for creativity at all. This does.In almost all novels, there are three major movements involved as the protagonist struggles to resolve his or her problem. There are dozens—maybe even hundreds—of smaller movements, but by and large, there are almost always three major movements or crucial points. That’s what this kind of outline will show. First, the inciting incident that kicks off the story. Then, the result of each of the three major movements. Finally, the resolution. Five statements. That’s it. The whole of your novel is contained therein. With enormous freedom within it for those who are afraid their creativity will be stifled…This is so important to grasping this that I’m going to belabor it a bit. Each statement represents the result of the major action taken to resolve the problem. Not the  beginning and development of the action. Major difference and for those that don’t get this, it’s always because they haven’t shifted their thinking and definition of outlines from those old comp definitions and models. Again, it represents the outcome of the major action. How you as the author get to that outcome is totally up to you. It gives you complete creative freedom. Look at it as the same thing as driving from New York to Los Angeles. You know that’s your goal. Get to L.A. There are a thousand ways to do that. You might drive down and go through Arizona. You might go north and go through part of Canada. You might zig-zag northwest and southwest the whole way. You might go directly west in a straight line. What’s important is that you end up in L.A., right? That’s what this kind of outline does. It gives you your outcome (arriving in L.A.), but it allows you complete freedom in how you get there. I know I keep repeating this, but I also know from experience how ingrained those godawful comp I outlines are in our brains, that it’s important that you grasp the difference.I'm going to use my own story I Shoulda Seen a Credit Arranger in my collection titled \"Monday's Meal\" to illustrate a typical outline. The first statement will be:Complication or inciting incident:Debt endangers Pete (This is the complication that provides the occasion for the story. Every story must have an inciting incident to kick-start it. Something must happen that changes the protagonist's world and by doing so, creates a problem/goal. This is where stories must begin - not with setting or backstory. Act I, as it were.)Development: (This is the second part of the outline. The development steps that lead to the resolution. Act II, as it were, following Aristotle's Poetics)1.Tommy cons Pete into a kidnapping2. Pete and Tommy botch kidnapping3. Pete escapesResolution: (This is the third and final step. Act III.)Pete pays for mistakeHere’s the outline without the extraneous material:Debt endangers Pete.Tommy cons Pete into a kidnappingPete and Tommy botch the kidnappingPete pays for mistake.I used this for the 18-page  short story that appeared first in The South Carolina Review and then I wrote a 92,000 word novel… using the same exact outline. Worked perfectly for both of them. Oh, yeah. I also wrote a screenplay for this that was a finalist in both the Writer’s Guild and Best of Austin screenplay competitons… and guess what? You guessed it. I used the same exact outline and it worked perfectly. There are major differences in all three versions, but the central story remained the same and was a practical instrument in all three forms. It works!This came to seventeen words, two over the optimim. If you're under twenty, you're fine. Once I have this outline, the rest is just filling in the blanks. But, everything in the story must contribute to the outline. I can't, for instance, start talking about Pete's childhood in New Orleans, for example. Not unless it contributes to the situation he's in.Now. Look at the elements. There's each of the three things I said should be in the outline. A human noun, a strong, concrete action verb, and a direct object. I didn't, for instance, say \"Pete is in debt\" for my complication. Why? Because is is a static verb. Always think in straightforward active terms.You might also notice I didn't have a happy-sappy \"Hollywood\" ending. Those don't work in literature. They work (I guess) in direct-to-video movies (and more than a few that we see at the theater) and in supermarket novels, but not in quality fiction, and that's what we're interested in here, I assume.Doesn't look much like Missus Grundy's Roman numeral outline, does it? But, if you read the story and then compare it to the outline, you'll see it's all there. And it allows for you to roam and be creative within the story. You just have to remain within the strictures of the outline. But, there's a heck of a lot of freedom there!Let’s look at just one of those statements, the first one. Tommy cons Pete into a kidnapping. In the short story, titled I Shoulda Seen a Credit Arranger, this action took about four pages. Tommy comes into a bar where Pete’s hustling pool, draws him away from the huckleberry he’s hustling to another bar, where he lays out the scam, to kidnap the head of the Cajun Mafia and amputate his hand and hold that for ransom. That was how I got to the outcome of the outlined point.Then, in the novel, it took about 80 pages to get to the same point. I had more room with the novel. In the novel, Pete still has the same problem—in heavy debt to the Mafia for gambling—and Tommy cons him into the same kidnapping as before. But, this time, to get to that place, there’s some other developments. First, Tommy talks Pete into kidnapping a supermarket manager and holding his wife in their home with Pete guarding her while Tommy and the manager go to his store and clean out his safe. But, before that, the pair realize they don’t have suits and part of the supermarket caper is that they have to go into their nice neighborhood and without suits they’ll stick out. So, because they’re tapped out and neither have a suit, they decide to pick up operating capital (to buy suits with) by robbing a streetcar. Which goes horribly wrong. Now, because of a surveillance camera on the streetcar, their pictures are everywhere on TV and the stakes are really ratcheted up. Besides escaping the Mob, they now have to worry about the law. Finally, they do kidnap the head of the Cajun Mafia and remove his hand. See what I mean about the freedom this kind of outline allows? Enormous freedom. They still get to the kidnapping, but this time, instead of driving straight through, they go way down south to Arizona before they wend back up northwest to L.A. Same outline, same outcome, different way to get there.In the screenplay, they don’t get to the kidnapping until about page 45. And, some other things happen there that didn’t in the short story or novel. But… they still end up in L.A. Can you see how this kind of outline gives you a roadmap as well as complete freedom? It really, really does. It’s why when I see as I did in the recent postings of another forum about people spouting off about how they hate outlines, I know they’ve never been exposed to this kind. They’re always thinking about 10-page (or longer!) monstrosities with all those Roman numerals, describing the beginnings and travel route to their scene or plot point goals. I agree. Those are horrible, horrible, mind-numbing and creativity-stifling monsters. This isn’t at all. What this kind of outline does is force you to think through the story before you write it. You spot problems before you waste two hundred or two thousand (or more) words on them. Suddenly, writing becomes a breeze. It really does.In the story above, the definition of a story is adhered to. A story consists of a character in trouble - has a need, wants something, etc. A story always begins with the inciting incident - whatever happens to drastically change the protagonist's world and create a problem for him or her (it has to be the biggest problem in his/her life at that point and one the reader will deem worthy enough to follow him in solving it, reaching his/her goal). Pete's in trouble - he owes a lot of money to a nasty bookie. He has to do something about it. He does get tricked by Tommy into an ill-fated kidnapping, but once he's in it, he begins to take his own action. You can have coincidence in a story, but it should never be a coincidence that helps the main character. It can appear at first to do so, but it never really can. It must always hinder the character. And stories are drama, which means you must create scenes, not wander around inside the head of the character, and scenes are by definition, action. There must be dramatic action. Also, a protagonist may be reactive at first, but very quickly he or she must become proactive, acting on his or her own behalf to solve the problem, gain the goal, etc. Reactive characters (characters to whom things \"happen\" in which they spend their time on stage reacting to those things) are boring and don't belong in good fiction. And lastly, because of an action the protagonist takes, there must come a reversal and a change in the character. What Joyce called an \"epiphany\". Characters in fiction, must, as a result of the actions of the story, become profoundly changed from the person they were at the beginning of the story. Also, the character can't just think through the problem, although obviously, that can be a part of his epiphany, but it has to be occasioned by an action that he can then process internally. The epiphany also cannot be attained through a conversation with another character. There has to be an actual action which changes him and turns the story. Once that happens, the story is over. Get out. Start a new story. But first create an outline for it. You'll thank yourself.A logical question is: What if I see a “better” story or way for the character to get from Point A to Point B? Maybe even an entirely different story? No problem. Just change your outline and you still have a roadmap that’s easy to follow and one that give you complete freedom.The nice thing about this kind of outline is that you save paper. You can write the whole thing on a napkin or even a matchbook cover…Once you've created an outline of this sort, it's almost impossible to stray in the wrong direction. If you find yourself doing that, just glance at the outline and get back on the right road.Blue skies,Les"},

Primarily, because of the length of this form (short story) we will concentrate on the principle character, since short stories are normally about only one or two central characters, as a rule. Space simply doesn’t allow for many more in most such stories.This is a little bit of a different approach to writing fiction. Many studies begin with a plot. Plot is important, certainly, but character in stories is at least equally important. To give you an idea of where we’re going, we’re going to come up with a primary character first and then start him or her off in some kind of trouble. If you analyze stories, I think you’ll find most of them constructed this way.There are three basic kinds of characters found in short stories -- Individual, Typical and Universal characters. At this point, we’re going to concentrate on an Individual character. Typical and Universal characters are self-explanatory, in most respects, and generally are minor characters in most stories. For the purposes of this lesson, we want to “cast our lead”; therefore, we will create an individual character.There are five methods of presenting characters in fiction. The indirect method is called authorial interpretation, which is simply “telling” the reader the character’s background, motives, values, virtues and so on. There is a big advantage in describing a character this way because you can cover a lot of material quickly, to let us know what you want about the character, to move about in time and space at will, and to tell us what he or she feels.An example of authorial interpretation would be like this description in Tony Ardizzone’s short story, “Baseball Fever” from his collection Taking It Home”“Mickey Meenan was a very quiet kid, and most of the time he was around you didn’t even notice he was there. He was tall for a third grader, gawky, spotted everywhere you could see with freckles, and he’d pick his earwax with his little finger or a stick and then stare at it for so long he made you ask him what was he going to do with it. “I dunno,” he’d always say, and then he’d always eat it or wipe it on his pants leg and then start working on his other ear. All the kids thought he was spoiled because he was an only child. Really, we were jealous. Mickey had a hundred toys, none of them broken; a thousand comic books, not one page torn.”The four methods of direct presentation are appearance, speech, action,  and thought. In this space, we’ll talk about appearance because our sight is our most acute sense and we get more information from sight than any of the other senses. Here’s an example of an appearance description:“Mrs. Withers, the dietician, marched in through the back door, drew up, and scanned the room. She wore her usual Betty Grable hairdo and open-toed pumps, and her shoulder had an aura of shoulder pads even in a sleeveless dress.” This is from Margaret Atwood’s The Edible Woman.Do you see how each of these two examples work in rendering a picture of the character to us, the reader? For a valuable exercise, use one or both of these methods and create a character sketch of 1-3 paragraphs..And also, did you notice in these two examples that both protagonists start out in the story at odds with their surroundings? This is what I mean, in part, by “getting our characters in trouble.”If you think about all the great stories you’ve read in your lifetime, the main thing I'll bet money you remember most are the characters. Huck Finn, Meursault, Porfiry, Scrooge and Lear...the list is endless. We all have our own examples. Many times, writers are focused on the plot, believing that to be the most important part of a story. Au contraire! Plot is important but almost always takes a back seat to characters, except in lesser stories. The higher quality the piece in fact, the lesser value is assigned to plot and the more to character. Literature of quality, regardless of the genre, is defined by how it illuminates character and how it shows us a facet of the human condition, either in a new and novel way or explores the nooks and crannies of the human psyche heretofore unexplored or in sufficient depth to provide a clearer understanding. Stories that last are almost always interested in developing memorable characters. That is why we remember the character long after we have forgotten what it was exactly that they did. Beginning writers of genre fiction, say, science fiction, sometimes mistakenly believe the story is in the new and novel technology they are going to bring forth. A very wrong impression. All good stories, regardless of genre, are ultimately about people almost exclusively. The technology, in the sci-fi example, is merely the setting and may help advance the plot, but the central focus should always be on the folks in the story--what happens to them and how they react and what they learn from the event or situation or crisis.As Janet Burroway states in her excellent book,  Writing Fiction: A Guide to Narrative Craft, “Human character is in the foreground of all fiction, however the humanity might be disguised. Anthropomorphism may be a scientific sin, but it is a literary necessity. Bugs Bunny isn’t a rabbit; he’s a plucky youth in ears. The romantic heroes of Watership Down are out of the Arthurian tradition, not out of the hutch.”Therefore, we are going to begin with a character, preferably the principle character you’re going to use in your story. You might want to draw up a biographical sketch of a character you wish to write a story about. This should be the principle character you will build your story around. Include things like their religion, their upbringing, their hobbies, their avocations, their vocations, their education, their political point of view--in short, everything that might be revealing of their persona. Include a physical description as well. Age, sex, all those things that are important. What we’re after is a composite of a character that will make that person seem “real” to you and ultimately the reader. The more details you can provide, the better. For instance, does your character have a facial tic that becomes prominent when he/she is in a stressful situation? Does he/she become sexually aroused at the sounds of pigeons cooing...and where did that stimulus derive from, what incident in his or her history? The more you know about a character, the more realistic will he or she be drawn. That doesn’t mean all or even any of this will appear in the story. Just the fact that you know it will provide the necessary verisimilitude to give the reader a believable character. Put some time into creating a name for your character. Names tell us a lot about the person in fiction. Try and use one or two of the methods of character presentation I talked about earlier. You won’t necessarily use all or even most of these details in your actual story, but the more fully-realized the character is in your own mind, the “realer” the character will come across in your writing.“God is in the details”, someone once said, and this is indeed true in writing stories. (The devil is also in the details…)Perhaps the best method in creating stories is to first create a character you are interested in and set him or her in motion. Once we have our character, our next move is to begin a story with that character in some kind of trouble, either minor or major and that is the way most stories are created.This leads us to a valuable exercise in not only creating characters but in making them effective and realistic protagonists on the page. A good friend of mine, Jane Bradley, author of Power Lines and Living Doll, came up with this exercise while on a motor trip with her young daughter. They would pick out something they would see as their car hurtled down the highway or driving through an ordinary neighborhood and then describe it through the eyes of the various characters they chose. For example, a setting sun might appear as an egg about to be dropped into a skillet by a starving woman. The same sun might appear to be a Spanish doubloon to a treasure hunter. Then, they would describe a whole scene through that person’s eyes. A cable TV installer might look for cable wires when viewing a normal neighborhood, while someone who sold windows might concentrate exclusively on what the windows looked like. A pervert might notice primarily which yards contained tricycles. Get the idea? Once you start looking at ordinary scenes through the eyes of your characters they become particular to that character and the story you’re writing. It’s an extremely effective exercise and can get you into your character’s head almost immediately and the knowledge you will gain from seeing your universe from the character’s pov will be invaluable in drawing realistic and believable characters. I am going to ask each of you to look at an ordinary scene, perhaps something you look at every day--a drive to work or school or to the store, for example--and describe that scene through the eyes of your character. Write 2-3 paragraphs of what your character sees. This is not what you see; it's what your character would notice. Again, this is just something I think you will find valuable in getting into the \"head\" of your character.I used an exercise that was very helpful in my “on-ground” creative writing classes to my writing students. I’d write a whole bunch of different personas on pieces of paper and give them to my students. They would include such beings as: a German shepherd, a nun, a pimp, a newly-divorced woman, an engineer, a just-arrived immigrant from Ghana, a blind man, a deaf woman, an Amish preteen girl on her first visit away from the farm, an escaped convict… you get the idea. I’d come up with a different one for each member of the class. I’d pass them out to the students, making sure they understood they weren’t to reveal to their classmates what their persona was, and then send them out onto the campus grounds and ask them to write a brief description from that persona’s pov of what they saw. When they returned, they would then read their descriptions and the rest of the class would guess who or what they were. It’s truly a great exercise. It reveals that we all—because of a host of factors—what age or sex or culture or vocation or whatever—all have selective sight. A social worker walking down a neighborhood street might notice the tricycle in the uncut front yard of a home and the bag of empty whiskey bottles waiting to be picked up, while a siding salesman would be “blind” to that and only “see” the house next door to it with the framing faded, obviously needing new siding. That kind of thing. The German shepherd might notice the fire hydrants, while the Amish girl might notice the clothes of the other girls. You get the idea. Those of you who teach writing or English, try this and I think you’ll be very pleased at the results. Also, this is a great exercise to do yourself when writing a character in your stories. I often do this when I’m writing a novel. If I’ve got a burglar in the book, for instance, I take a drive or a walk around the neighborhood, trying to see it through a burglar’s eyes. (Not that hard, in my case…). I look for houses where no cars are visible, houses where three days of newspapers are on the lawn, where the mailbox seems to be stuffed… that kind of thing. If I’m writing a character who’s a fireman, I look for houses where trash is stacked up against the garage, or where the wiring leading into a house appears to be frayed. We all see the same scene but only see those things that pertain to us and the rest are invisible to us.Another element which I’d like to introduce in this lesson to get us all off to a good start is a good opening to your stories. Many times, the impetus to writing a good story is writing a good first line or beginning. While there are no rules in writing openings, there are strong opinions over what doesn’t work. Author Harry Crews, for example, believes a writer should never begin a story with a line of dialogue, feeling the practice creates no tension and is therefore entirely without drama. He says that the only character in a story who has to be introduced in a vacuum is the first one that appears and if that character speaks before he or she is introduced through an action or description, you have “a vacuum speaking into a vacuum.” I happen agree with his view, even though I’m sure someone will be able to produce an example that goes against this wisdom.Another mistake in beginnings among younger writers (in experience, not age) is starting their stories at the beginning of the day, often with an alarm clock ringing. Writer Debra Sparks feels such writers don’t realize most of the time that “a lot has already happened when the story began.”Rick Bass observes that the voice of the story is established immediately in the beginnings of good stories. “The possibility of everything that’s going to happen is contained in that first sentence,” he states, agreeing with Roman poet Ovid, who said that writers should attempt “to say at once what ought at once to be said.” Too often, beginning writers take too long to get to the actual story, writing pages of setting and/or description or \"backstory\". By the time they’ve gotten to the actual “story” the reader is long gone.Of course, at this early date you may have little idea of where your story is going to end up at, and it is because of this that beginnings change during the rewrite. But, let’s pretend we know where they are going, to start with, and if the story changes direction we can always go back in the rewrite stage and rewrite them.Novelist Richard Ford opines that the beginning of a story is like meeting someone. “What you respond to is a person’s confidence”, and your (reader’s) intuition that “the meeting will somehow be consequential.” Ford calls the beginning sentences, “setting the world.” “It has to have an initial power,” says Mark Helprin. “Then the power of whatever you start with has to be maintained.”So, all an opening sentence or paragraph has to contain is voice, confidence and power. Easy! Well, not exactly, not always, but important enough to spend time on, perhaps more time than some of the other parts of the story. For practical purposes, for those of you wishing to become published, opening sentences are crucial. Editors are mean little critters, just waiting for a chance to say no to a story and if it doesn’t hook them almost immediately, they’re off to the next one. Well, they’re not all “mean little critters”, but even the nice ones have that in common. In my former role as an editor of the ligmag The Crescent Review, my own experience was that if I wasn’t grabbed by the end of the first paragraph, it's going to be hard to sell me the story from then on. I did read all the stories sent me, but many editors don't go beyond the first paragraph or two. Just one of those harsh facts of life!The fun of writing stories that start out in the right place and maintain their power to the end comes from plain hard work, usually from writing and rewriting. As Melanie Rae Thon says, “You’re going to be waiting until you’re a dead person if you wait for the muse to visit.”Hope this helps!"},
{"title": "THE RUBBER DUCKY", "date": "Monday, April 5, 2010", "text": "(From Sydney Lumet’s and Paddy Chayevsky’s writings on the subject. This is aimed at screenwriters and playwrights, but the same material applies to fiction writers.)I am going to rant about the \"Rubber Ducky\" theory of backstory for a bit.The \"Rubber Ducky\" is Paddy Chayevsky's term for when the hero or villain, at a lull in the action, explains that he is the way he is because his mother took away his rubber ducky when he was three. It's always a nice scene, well acted, beautifully lit, with a powerfully written monolog that the writer spent days on. And totally unnecessary in most stories and overused… It usually comes from not trusting the reader’s or viewer’s intelligence to “get it”…The character's past may be crucial to your story. Batman is haunted by the murder of his parents by a mugger when he was small. That's why he likes to dress up in latex and beat the tar out of muggers. In The Terminator, the hero's past, which is in the future, is the hellish future of the entire human race. It sets up the stakes for the whole movie. In movies like these, we do need to know about the hero's past. You will need to keep coming back to that past, to give it the weight it deserves. Both Batman and The Terminator, in fact, start with the hero's backstory before getting into the main story.But if all you're trying to do is give your hero more emotional depth, for the sake of emotional depth, without integrating his backstory into your story, you are running the risk of awakening the dread Ducky.The strongest way to create a sense of character is to give the character things to do and say on screen that give us a sense of a person. If the character's personality doesn't leap off the page, readers will feel that the character is flat. Development executives will ask to know more about the protagonist's past. You will surrender to the urge to put in a Rubber Ducky. Then if the picture becomes a go, the actors will get attached to the Rubber Ducky scene, because it shows they can Act. So the Ducky stays in the picture. (To its detriment.)A Ducky cheapens the character. Kurt Russell's character Jack O'Neil in Stargate is suicidal because his young son killed himself accidentally with a pistol he left around the house. To make us care more about his otherwise unpleasant character, O'Neil delivers a small monologue to James Spader's character Daniel Jackson. It is important to the picture that O'Neil is suicidal, but not why; and given O'Neil's contempt for Daniel Jackson, it's unlikely that he would open up to him about his guilt and shame. The emotional truth of the situation is that Daniel Jackson would never know why O'Neil is so willing to die. It might have been more emotionally truthful for the movie never to relay this information. But I wouldn't be surprised if Kurt Russell wanted the audience to know that his character had a good reason for being such a bastard. Actors want you to have sympathy for them. They're kind of needy critters...A good example of a Ducky that never comes up is Thelma and Louise. It becomes clear over the course of the movie that something terrible happened to Louise (Susan Sarandon) in Texas; that's why the two women take the long way around to the Mexican border. You begin to realize that she must have been raped in Texas, and then disbelieved in court. But Louise never says anything explicit about it in the movie, and that makes her backstory all the stronger.If development execs are asking you for the Ducky, the screenplay isn't working for them. Don't give them the Ducky, but do focus your scenes so they show the character. Go through your script again, scene by scene, and make sure that every time the hero acts, it shows us who he is. Make sure you communicate how he feels about what he's doing, and give him a fresh way of doing it, one someone else wouldn't have...Sidney Lumet:In the early days of television, when the \"kitchen sink\" school of realism held sway, we always reached a point where we \"explained\" the character. Around two-thirds of the way through, someone articulated the psychological truth that made the character the person he was. [Paddy] Chayefsky and I used to call this the \"rubber-ducky\" school of drama: \"Someone once took his rubber ducky away from him, and that's why he's a deranged killer.\" That was the fashion then, and with many producers and studios it still is.I always try to eliminate the rubber-ducky explanations. A character should be clear from his present actions. And his behavior as the picture goes on should reveal the psychological motivations. If the writer has to state the reasons, something's wrong in the way the character has been written.Hope this helps!"},
{"title": "THE BASICS - WHAT A STORY IS", "date": "Saturday, April 3, 2010", "text": "WHAT A STORY ISLes EdgertonThe first thing any story needs is a protagonist who wants something. A goal. And the goal must be something the average reader can relate to and see as worthwhile. And the best goals are almost always intrinsic and not material. To merely desire wealth, for instance, doesn't qualify as a good story goal, unless there is an underlying motive such as acquiring wealth will bring the protagonist respect (in his or her mind). Acquiring wealth is the surface goal; gaining respect is the story-worthy goal. Wealth, in a situation like this, isn't the real goal; respect is. One of the best stories I've ever read, The Suicide’s Wife, by David Madden, was based on a simple premise. The protagonist, a middle-aged woman, wanted one thing. Her driver's license. She was trapped in a marriage that had imprisoned her and when her husband committed suicide, obtaining her driver's license represented immense freedom to her. She went through all kinds of trials and setbacks to gain that license and the resulting story was riveting.Some of the best story goals are the desire of the protagonist to change something in his or her life. A relationship that isn't working, for instance. The lack of a relationship could be another one.Always start your main character off in trouble. This doesn't mean melodramatic trouble like burglars breaking in, armed robbers shoving a gun in his or her face, nuclear war or any of that stuff. More drama is enacted at the breakfast table of an ordinary family each morning than is in ten pot-boilers, as Janet Burroway tells us. The one thing you should avoid in all of your stories are happy characters with perfect lives. Let's say you have a character named Biff. Biff goes through high school with a 4.0 average, is captain of the football and debate teams, gets a full scholarship to Harvard, graduates magna cum laude, lands a job on Wall Street where he becomes president of the firm, meets Diane who's had a similar background and they marry, raising three perfect children and they die in each other's arms in their sleep at the ripe old age of ninety-three, just after they've been awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature for the poetry they've teamed up to write. Nice story if you happen to be Biff or Diane or one of their friends or relatives, but for a reader? Yuch! Borrr-ring! Now, make Biff black and Diane white and their families don’t like it and you've got a story (Othello)! Or Make Diane's parents hate Biff (Romeo & Juliet). Again, you've got a story.The next thing you need to do in your story is once you've got your character up a tree (trouble), begin to throw rocks (roadblocks that prevent him from attaining the goal) at him or her. At this point, you've got a character who begins in some sort of trouble (in a relationship, say), has a goal the reader can identify with (fix the relationship, say), and now you've got to make it increasingly harder to achieve the goal. Each time you throw a rock at him or her, it has to be a bigger rock thrown harder than the last one. Until the last rock, which is the biggest and has the most velocity of all, and by dint of his or her own means, he or she ducks the rock and achieves the goal. Or doesn't achieve it but by the process learns something about him- or herself. That's all any story is. There's no big mystery, believe me. You can break any worthwhile story down exactly like that.The other requirement of contemporary fiction is to begin your story as close to the end as possible. In media res, as they say. The most common fault of beginning writers is to begin their story with too much backstory. This results from not trusting the reader's intelligence. Most first drafts, even from seasoned writers, contain way too much preamble. I like to refer to it as \"the writer clearing his or her throat.\" It's always the first thing that needs cut. This is just to warn you.Look at good jokes. Jokes are basically short stories. A traveling salesman goes up to this farmer's house... You don't have to tell the audience what kind of a man he is, what his childhood was like, what caused him to go to the farmer's house in the first place...none of that stuff. A traveling salesman goes up to this farmer's house tells the audience everything they need to know about him, right? Such a joke beginning makes use of the conventions of jokes - every listener to such a joke assumes certain things about the man. Stories have the same conventions. By placing a particular character in a certain situation tells the reader everything he or she needs to know - you don't have to include all the steps leading up to the situation. When the farmer answered the door, the salesman said, \"Hi. I just ran out of gas. Can I spend the night here?\" This is the middle of the joke. Jokes, like stories, have beginnings, middles and ends. As in stories, we don't explain why he's asking this, we just show the action. Then, in the joke, just as in a story, it takes a turn, makes a twist in what the listener (reader) was expecting. \"Sure,\" the farmer said. \"You can spend the night here...but you'll have to sleep with my son.\" Here the joke (story) makes a turn (roadblock to the goal) the listener (reader) wasn't expecting. The protagonist has begun in trouble (out of gas) and tried to reach his goal (a place to spend the night), but the farmer has just thrown a rock at him - instead of the expected response - yes, but you'll have to spend the night with my daughters - he's told he can stay but has to sleep with the farmer's son. Whoa. This is where you grab the listener's (reader's) attention firmly. Now what? \"Damn!\" the salesman says, \"I must be in the wrong joke!\" With that ending, the protagonist didn't achieve his intended goal, but he achieved a similar goal (to spend the night) and we see he learned something about himself in the process. He found he had a sense of humor. The joke contains an epiphany for the protagonist and the reader gets a payoff as well. And this is basically all that stories are about.This is where all stories spring from. They began around cavemen's campfires, with someone with the gift of cave-gab talking about the day's sabre-tooth tiger hunt or telling something funny or interesting that happened to him or someone else in the tribe...and we're still doing pretty much the same thing today.This is basic stuff that most of us know, but sometimes it's a good idea to go back and review the basics. Sometimes, we get caught up in all we read and hear about writing and forget that there are only two things necessary for a good story--that it be interesting and that it be clear. Achieve that and you're on your way!"},

This is dialog when what isn’t said is the important thing—the subtext. The opposite of that is dialog we might call “Q&A” dialog, that is, where a character asks a question or makes a statement and the responder answers “on-the-nose” or, in a direct response. That kind of dialog often is seen in info dumps where the author is trying to get across information she thinks the reader needs. Writers should try to avoid such dialog at all costs!Below is an exercise I give my classes you may find useful. I pick two students who act out the two parts (cleverly designated as “She” and “He”). When they’re done, I have them answer the questions that follow, and then they split into pairs and come up with their own examples. It’s a great exercise and most of the students really get into it. Most importantly, it gives a realistic example of off-the-nose dialog and it also provides a great lesson to my students about just how hard it is to write good dialog. Besides helping writers become better at their craft, it also informs students to become better readers. And we need intelligent readers!DIALOGUE EXERCISEShe: The Bentley's baby was cute, wasn't it?He: I don't think I saw it. I was in the kitchen with the guys all night.She: Well, she was a cute little baby.He: Great. Women think all babies are cute. Ever heard a woman say someone's kid was ugly? I mean, except for Shrek's parents' friends?She: Brad and Gena seem so happy.He: They should be. He just got a promotion.She: Silly! I mean the baby.He: There goes the promotion. The raise part of it, anyway.She: I think they'll manage. Babies are worth a sacrifice or two.He: If you say so.She: Look at it practically. Their little girl will probably take care of them in their old age.He: That's a great tradeoff. Let's see... take care of a kid for 22 years—I'm including college—and they stick you in a home for your final three years. Probably use your own money to fund your own old folks' home. Sounds like a good deal.She: It's not like that.He: Yeah. Whatever.Silence for a few seconds.She: Samantha.He: Huh?She: Samantha. They named her Samantha. I think that's cute. I wonder if they'll call her \"Sam.\"He: They ought to call her \"Stinky.\"She: What?He: You heard me. \"Stinky.\" The kid smells.She: All kids smell when they make a mess. You smelled. Besides, how would you know if she smelled? You said you stayed in the kitchen.He: All kids smell.She: Then you change their diaper.He: Yeah. There goes the entertainment budget.She: You mean the beer budget.He: So?She: So is if you cut out a few beers, you'd have plenty of diapers... and lose a few pounds...He: You sayin' I'm fat?She: I'm saying diapers don't cost that much. A six-pack or two.He: Maybe. But how many six-packs does it cost to send a kid to college?She (laughing): About what you go through in a week!He (mutters): Must be a cheap school. All the classes on the internet? The school's in the Caribbean?She: She'll probably get scholarships anyway.He: That's cool. That means she'll spend all her time partyin'. End up pregnant.She: She'll be way too smart for that.He: Like her mom was?DISCUSSION QUESTIONSWho were this man and woman really talking about? What did the woman want? What did the man want? Did either of them come right out and say what they were really talking about?This is dialogue that isn't \"on the nose.\" It's the way the best dialogue is written. What's important is what isn't said; the subtext. The subtext is the real message that's under the surface of the actual dialogue spoken.This is what I want you to write (in teams). Two people talking about something that is really being expressed in subtext—dialogue that's not \"on the nose.\" You can pick any subject you want for them to discuss (within reason!). Whatever they’re really talking about can’t be mentioned in the dialog itself. After you deliver your dialogue, the class will attempt to guess what it is you’ve really been talking about.Time: 2-3 minutes performance time per person. I'd rehearse this so your team falls within the time limit. That’s where I’ll take the most points off, for being short of the minimum.Notes: You don't need to memorize the exchange but can read off your script.Bonus points: Your team can gain bonus points if you use props and/or costumes.That’s the whole enchilada. For those on here who teach classes on writing, you may want to adopt this puppy for use in your own classes or for a workshop if you’re in a writing group. It’s really fun! Especially when participants get uber-creative and come in with props and costumes. I’d tell you about some of the ones students have come up with, but many are R-Rated and even X-Rated and there may be kids up late at night sneaking a peek at this…If anyone uses this, I’d love to hear how it went!P.S. If anyone's wondering what the photo is, it's my former wife (and the mother of my daughters, Britney and Sienna) and moi, back in the early seventies... I think we had this same conversation and obviously I lost...) I'm really struck at my fine sense of fashion... I still wear that coat to important functions..."},
{"title": "THE FICTIVE DREAM", "date": "Wednesday, March 31, 2010", "text": "THE “FICTIVE DREAM”©Leslie EdgertonGonna get back to some writing craft stuff today. Hope it helps!The entire purpose of fiction is to transport the reader into almost a “dream-like state”, to where he or she “suspends their disbelief.” There are many techniques a writer can use to achieve this goal and we will be discussing a few of those that should be helpful.The use of details in a story is a very powerful means of inducing that dream. Let’s take a real-life example of how details convince others. Let’s assume there is a man, unemployed for six months, whose wife has been carping at him (justifiably) to get a job, but he hasn’t actually looked for months. However, he wants to convince her he’s trying his best to secure employment. On Monday, he has promised her he will go down to the unemployment office and see what they have. Monday evening, when she returns from her own job she asks him if he went as promised. It may go something like this:“Did you go to the unemployment office today like you promised?” Mary said, her eyebrows raising and her tone skeptical.“Of course I did. I was there bright and early. They just didn’t have anything I was qualified for. At least I made the effort.”“Right,” she said. “I believe you, Tony. I really do.” There was pure sarcasm in her voice. Leaving the room to go upstairs and change her work clothes, she spat out one word as she went up the stairs. “Liar!”Now, this is a passable scene (barely) but the man doesn’t convince his wife and he certainly doesn’t convince the reader. Now, imagine the same situation but structured a little differently:“Did you go to the unemployment office today like you promised?” Mary said, her tone skeptical.“Yeah,” Tony said. “Not that it did much good. They didn’t have a single job I was qualified for. Something weird happened, though. There was a lady just in front of me in line and she was nine months pregnant. Just as she got to the window, she started screaming and yelling and collapsed to the floor. People came running from everywhere and somebody called 911 and guess what! She had her damn baby right there! I couldn’t believe it! It was a boy. She was wearing this blue dress and when the blood got on it, it was the weirdest thing. Instead of turning it red, it turned it black. Anyway, it screwed everything up. I bet it was another half hour before they all settled down and I got to see a clerk. Not that it did any good. You’da thought maybe that would have brought me good luck, since I got to jump a place in line, but there wasn’t even one single, solitary job I could do. Unless I lied and told them I could handle heavy equipment. I thought about even doing that--lie--but I knew they’d figure it out as soon as I crawled up on that caterpillar seat that I didn’t know what the hell I was doing. How was your day? A little less traumatic, I hope?”See the difference? In the first example, whether Tony was speaking the truth or not it didn’t matter - Mary didn’t believe him and we don’t either. In the second example, by use of detail to embellish his story, it would be difficult not to believe Tony. There’s a pregnant lady - she’s the one in front of him - she’s wearing a blue dress that turns black where the blood spotted it - and so on and so on. By the use of details, he has turned a weak lie into a story that would be hard to disbelieve.Tony also used something else to suspend his wife’s disbelief. He used tension. What could have been a tenser situation than what he was describing! Tension keeps the reader turning the pages and overlooking the fact he or she knew when beginning the story - that it was fiction and therefore a lie.James Frey, in his book How To Write A Damn Good Novel, II informs that the fictive dream is created by the power of suggestion. He goes on to say that “the power of suggestion is the operant tool of the ad man, the con man, the propagandist, the priest, the hypnotist, and, yes, the fiction writer.” That’s exactly what we are doing when we write fiction--we’re running a con game. We’re lying to readers. The trick is to get them (the reader) to believe the lie.Besides the use of details and creating tension, the writer must provide for the reader an emotional involvement. This is done by creating sympathy, identification, and empathy for the protagonist. Once we care, on some level, about the character the story is about, we will suspend our disbelief and keep on reading.Sympathy for a character is created in a number of ways. Sympathy does not necessarily mean admiration, which Frey points out. He offers the character of Jake LaMotta in the film Raging Bull for an example. LaMotta beats his wife, seduces underage girls, has a horrible temper, suffers from paranoia and speaks in grunts. He is a total savage. Yet the LaMotta character in the movie gets enormous audience sympathy. Why? Because, at the start of the movie, LaMotta is living in ignorance, degradation and poverty and so the audience feels sorry for him, and therefore will follow him on the screen through his story, regardless of the fact that he is a brutish lout in almost all respects.Sympathy is how a reader gains emotional access to a story and without it there is no involvement and the reader will put down the book or story.Second, the reader must identify with the character. This happens when the reader is not only sympathetic with the character’s situation but also applauds his or her goals and wants the character to achieve them. Frey again gives some very good examples:In Jaws, the reader supports Brody’s goal to destroy the shark.In The Red Badge of Courage, the reader supports Henry’s desire to prove to himself he isn’t a coward.In Gone With The Wind, the reader supports Scarlett’s desire to get her plantation back after it is destroyed by Yankees. (I can relate to that, being a Southerner!)The way to achieve identification is to give the main character goals and desires that the reader will view as desirable him- or herself.The third technique in achieving emotional involvement for the reader is empathy. Empathy is an even more powerful emotion than sympathy. A husband suffering birth pains along with his wife is an example of empathy. Empathy is simply the reader putting himself in the shoes of the character. One way to do this is to use the power of suggestion. Use details to suggest what it is like to be the character and experience what he or she is experiencing. Using my own story “My Idea of a Good Thing” in Monday's Meal, Raye is not a particularly admirable character--she’s addicted to alcohol, for example. It would have created little empathy if I had just drawn her as this weak-willed person who just can’t say no to a drink--but when you show the reader what her struggle is like, then most people can identify with her on some level and will then gain empathy. For instance, most people aren’t alcoholics, but most of us have fallen prey to some form of addiction. Maybe it’s cigarettes, maybe it’s chocolates, maybe it’s always falling for the wrong man or woman. There are lots of examples. By using details of the internal struggle, the reader can identify with their own private struggles. Reaching for a bottle of Stoli may evoke images within the reader of reaching for the pack of Marlboros or that pint of Haagen-Daz Chocolate-Chocolate Chip in the supermarket.Once you have established sympathy, identification and empathy for your character, you’ve created a strong emotional bond between that character and the readers. One final step is needed to bring the reader into that hypnotic state of suspended disbelief, called the plenary state in hypnosis. We are striving for the same effect.Inner conflict.This is the key to transporting the reader. It’s the storm that rages inside the characters heart, mind and soul. In fiction we have an advantage over media like film in showing inner conflict. In films this conflict can be shown only in exterior ways. In the written word and in plays, we have more tools since we can actually go into the character’s minds and we can use dialogue more abundantly than one can in movies. Too much dialogue in movies usually results in a kind of “talking heads” kind of production, but entire books have been successfully written almost entirely in dialogue. And what is a stage play without dialogue!To create inner conflict we need to show the character’s guilt, doubts, misgivings and remorse and we need to show the character struggling with decisions. There have to be decisions to be made to achieve the goal of the character and they can’t be easy decisions. Nothing that is black and white. The best literature is shaded gray. There should be pros and cons to each decision on the way to goal-achievement, and whatever is gained should be with some loss. Scarlett O’Hara, for example, ultimately gains her beloved Tara, but at the cost of two men who loved her and for whom she had love, albeit with bad timing. She gains the thing that is most important to her but in the process loses something almost equally valuable. This is the stuff of literature.Frey again gives an excellent way to think of inner conflict. He suggests thinking of it as a battle between two voices within the character: one of reason, the other of passion--or of two conflicting passions. Within the character him or herself rages a protagonist and an antagonist.Again, using my own story, Raye has a voice inside telling her she must stop drinking or die and another voice convincing her that if she does quit the booze, she will lose her soul or at least that which makes her an artist and therefore human. Which is preferable? To live physically and die emotionally or to do the reverse? In a perfect, happy-ending, fairy-tale kind of story, she could have both. She could dry out and find she plays even better than before, but that isn’t real life (at least not Raye’s “real life”).Try this: Pick a story you especially like (you can use the one you’re writing now, if you choose), and see if you can pick out how the author has created sympathy, identification and empathy for the main character. Then, identify the internal crisis in the protagonist’s mind. This is only for your own use - not to be shared with the rest of us and is designed to have you look at stories in their bare essence. Basically, you will be looking for what the character wants and why did you (reader) care enough to keep reading to see if the goal was achieved.It's important that the author create this in the beginning of her story - empathy, sympathy and/or identification for the central character. Else why should the reader continue?Answer: He/she won't…"},

{"title": "\"AS\" AND \"-ING\" CONSTRUCTIONS", "date": "Friday, March 26, 2010", "text": "Back to writing for a bit...\"As\" and \"ing\" Are Considered Hack and Amateurish ConstructionsLes EdgertonThere are two stylistic constructions that are generally considered \"hack\" writing constructions, namely:Pulling off her gloves, she turned to face him.orAs she pulled off her gloves, she turned to face him.Both the as construction and the -ing construction as used above are correct grammatically and express the action clearly and unambiguously. But notice that both of these constructions take a bit of action (\"She pulled off her gloves...\") and tuck it away into a dependent clause. (\"Pulling off her gloves...\"). This tends to place some of your action at one remove from your reader, to make the actions seem incidental, unimportant. And so if you use these constructions often, you weaken your writing.Another reason to avoid the as and -ing constructions is that they sometimes give rise to physical impossibilities. Say you're writing as an archaeologist character describing her field work and you write, \"Disappearing into my tent, I changed into fresh clothes.\" The -ing construction forces simultaneity on two actions that can't possibly be simultaneous. The archaeologist didn't duck into the tent and pull on clean clothes at the same time - she was an archaeologist, not a contortionist.A better alternative to the above example would be to write, \"She pulled off her gloves, turned to face him.\" Or, you can make an -ing phrase less conspicuous by moving it to the middle of the sentence rather than the beginning. The participle construction has a particularly amateurish flavor when placed at the beginning of the sentence.Look at the following examples to see how these constructions weaken your writing, with the as and -ing constructions in boldfaced type:Ripping off several large, dripping hunks of burrito, she pulled a chair up to the kitchen table and took a large bite. As she chewed, she wondered who she was maddest at. James, she decided.The doorbell rang. \"Cheryl, it's me!\" boomed a deep, authoritative voice. \"James!\"Spotting her favorite red silk kimono crumpled on the floor, Cheryl stooped over and picked it up. As she pulled the kimono over her shoulders, she said a prayer of thanks that the wrinkled look was in.As her fingers unfastened the chain lock, she wondered how James had gotten her address. It wasn't listed in the telephone book.\"Good evening,\" James greeted with a small bow as the door swung open.\"The bug man came last week,\" Cheryl said sarcastically, refusing to budge from the door, \"I thought he'd exterminated all the pests in my life, but I guess he must have missed one. A big one.\"\"Funny, very funny,\" James said, clearly not amused as he leaned an arm against the door jamb. \"Now you'd better let me in before I start causing a scene.\"Now take a look at the same scene again, with the as and -ing clauses removed, along with some of the other problems, such as eliminating weak adverbs:She pulled up a chair to the kitchen table and took a large bite of the burrito she'd found behind the milk and orange juice bottles. Who was she maddest at? Probably James.The doorbell rang. \"Cheryl, it's me!\"James. It had to be.Cheryl sighed, stooped over and picked up her red silk kimono from the floor. Thank god the wrinkled look was in. But how had James gotten her address? It wasn't listed in the telephone book.\"Good evening.\" He made a small bow.\"The bug man came last week.\" Cheryl didn't budge from the door. \"I thought he'd exterminated all the pests in my life, but I guess he must have missed a big one.\"\"Funny, very funny.\" James leaned an arm against the door jamb. \"You'd better let me in before I start causing a scene.\"This admittedly isn't deathless prose, but the editing has made the passage subtler and more professional. Notice that also missing in the second version are the weak adverbs and some of the other, unnecessary slag of the first version.The point is, when an editor sees as and -ing constructions, a little red light goes off and he thinks, \"Amateur.\" You don't want that to happen. This is one of the first things you should check for in your rewrites. Use your \"Find\" feature to seek out and destroy all of these hack constructions, along with the -ly adverbs that almost always just weaken the prose."},

Like the sight of a dinky little white stick would make someone pass out!\"Whatever you say,\" I answered, more than a hint of sarcasm in my voice and probably a smirk on my lips, which I couldn't hold back. We both knew what it was that caused him to keel over and it wasn't some minuscule little bone fragment.\"Well, you better get more used to work than you are now,\" I said. \"Doctors work twenty-two hour days, seven days a week.

While your moron friends are studying calculus and logging time in detention popping their pimples, you'll be flipping September's Playmate of the Month foldout open and reading informative and educational articles. Without having to even give up your allowance to buy it or having to hide it under your mattress! Not only that, but by the time you're sixteen, you'll be the assistant manager already. On the day shift! Do you realize people in the convenience business will kill to snag the day shift? And bossing around those slackers who waited too long and fell subsequently far behind you from the gitgo in their own shortsighted career paths.\"None of my logic and arguments seem to work. He's bound and determined to stay in school. All I can do is hope he comes to his senses before it's too late and he arrives at the ripe old age of sixteen and finds out he's in line with twenty-nine other dropouts for the same job he could have had just for the asking four years earlier. Those four years will go by faster than he thinks.I just don't want Mike to make the same mistakes I've made when I was his age. I think most dads can relate. Like Hitler said, \"Youth is wasted on the young.\" Which is the real reason \"Mein Adolf\" founded the Hitler Youth. To help kids realize before it was too late they were throwing away their salad days along with the salad dressing. Hitler was lucky. He had a whole country at his disposal and didn't even have to do much to gain the people's support. Just make a few trains run on schedule and he becomes a regular god! Or was that that Italian guy... No matter.Would that I'd been so fortunate when I was a young lad!But, no. I had the kind of father who was a miserable follower. A Merino sheep, trés-docile variety. Pappy looked around our neighborhood and saw that all the other dads made their kids go to school and sure enough, there I was, sitting on my butt in third-hour English with all the rest of the little lambs whose fathers bought into the Trilateral Commission's clever-but-insidious plan. That \"not-so-secret\" master plan to keep Americans wage slaves for the rest of our lives by wasting our formative days in studying utterly-useless information solely designed to keep us from thinking for ourselves.George Orwell, you were sooooo right!!!!!!There were no 7-11's when I was a boy--kids have it all today!!!--but there was an Conoco gas station on our corner and the owner told me he'd hire me in a minute to sweep his floors and do simple stuff like oil changes and tranny lubes. Think my father would let me quit school and take advantage of this man's generous offer to teach me a useful and high-paying trade?Ha!Oh, I've told Mike more than once about my own father and how I'm trying to provide better opportunities for him than my stinkin' old man gave me, but does it register?Ha!You'd think he'd open his eyes and unplug the wax in his ears around his own house, see what goes on.I'm speaking of his mother. The woman I generously provided a home and marriage and many, many luxuries and other amenities to, at a time in her life when she was wasting away in college, misspending her valuable time pursuing such \"useful\" skills as training a mouse to run a maze. Yes, that's right. Training a rodent to go from here to there in a subdivided box. That's all she did in this one class, Psych 101, she was always yammering about. Three hundred sixty-four bucks she laid out at Rosedale Community College for Psych 101 and all you did was feed a rat a piece of Cheez-Whiz every time it made the so-called \"correct\" turn. For four months this went on. The hardest thing the prof had to do in his so-called \"job\" was stifle his giggling every time the suckers piled into his classroom and headed for the mouse housing projects in the back. P.T. Barnum was a piker compared to this slickster.\"Oh, yeah, rat lab,\" I remember mentioning to her at the time, with tongue-in-cheek. \"There's a big demand for that out there. I was just looking at the want ads in Sunday's paper and there must have been six and a half columns of ads from big-shot mouse executives searching desperately for experts to train their rats to run mazes. And the pay! You'd be amazed at what these guys are offering for mouse professionals. And that's just with a bachelor's! Don't even ask what master degree holders are getting! If you've got a doctorate, you need to start looking at houses with enough land for a small landing strip for your own private Lear jet that'll be whisking you off to Bermuda and the South of France on your many generously-provided-for vacations.\"Back then she used to laugh at stuff like that, say I was the funniest guy she'd ever known. That's all changed.Boy, and how!I wish Mike could have seen us together back then. When his mother was a kind, compassionate woman with a rich, warm sense of humor, instead of the shrew she's become and the kind of nagging, whining harpy he's always observed around the house.Back then, she was more than happy to be married to an inventor-slash-idea man. In those early, halcyon days, she was more than anxious to give her full support, both emotionally and in a practical way--by working a couple of easy jobs--to help further her husband's career. Does she still grant that unconditional and loving succor?Ha! I wish!You wouldn't have even asked such a question if you'd been by our house any weekday during the past six years at four-thirty p.m. when she arrived home… and just opened your ears a tiny bit as you were passing by!You wouldn't believe some of the things she says to me. Screams in that fishwife's shrill, irritating screech she has, I should say. In front of our only child, Mike, the fruit of our collective loins. What she supposes that does to the integrity of our family unit, I can't imagine. She doesn't have a clue what massive, irreversible damage is being done to our son's Id and Super Id when she makes her crude, insensitive, hateful remarks.Read some Freud, girlfriend!!!I hate to think about what kind of family he'll create some day. Does the name \"Son of Sam\" ring a bell???Just about every day, for instance, she'll come home from her first job, walk in the house and see me hard at work. Does she say, \"Hi, sweetheart. Whatcha working on? Would you share with me? I love to hear about your work! Take a break, hon, and come sit by me and tell me about some of the many knotty problems I know you're facing. Maybe you'd like a nice backrub to iron out all those nasty tensions and relieve the mental stress. Can I fix you a tasty rum and coke?\"No. She does not say that or anything resembling that. Not Miss Belinda nee Walker. Not Miss \"I've Been Working-So Hard At The RV Factory And My Feet Hurt And Soon I Have To Go To My Telemarketing Job\" Belinda. You kidding? You can't imagine a more selfish woman, who's totally into herself and no room for anything in that narrow world as inconsequential as a mere husband who's aged years beyond his chronological age from the never-ending tension she's created with her unreasonable attitude.No. What she says, almost every time is, \"On the couch again, eh? You know, when you get up, there's an imprint on the cover looks exactly like your body? I catch myself thinking it's the pattern they sewed in at the factory and wonder why they chose that. I wonder more why we bought it.\"Funny lady!She knows my work is 99.9% in my mind. Maybe a stranger or layman not familiar with the processes that are crucial to inventing the new products and ideas society desperately wants and needs would imagine I was just lying there daydreaming instead of what I'm actually doing--working my butt off to the bone!!! But, Belinda knows better and yet she elects to lash out at moi (yours truly) with these infantile, hurtful remarks. She also knows that the TV helps me immensely in the thinking process. I'm not really watching \"Days of Our Lives\" even though to an uninformed eye, it may appear that's what's going on. That's merely a form of white noise that helps me attain the proper frame of mind which only happens to be absolutely necessary for the tough mental drudgery required. I work much the same as a writer does. If I was a famous novelist and had sixty-eight bestsellers out and was lauded on \"The Larry King Show\" and \"Oprah\" and \"Nick at Nite\" would she make such asinine comments?Ha!I'd like to talk to Mrs. Stephen King and see what she has to say. What I'd really like to do is get Mrs. Stephen King over to the house, get her in the kitchen with Belinda and say to her, \"Hey. Educate this woman, will ya? Tell her what you say when you walk in on Steve in the Barcolounger and he's staring at the ceiling. Bet what you don't say is, 'Hey, Stevie, you on the Barco again? You know when you get up there's an exact imprint of your body on the leather. Ha, ha.'We both know the answer to that, don't we?Unfortunately, not only am I not Hitler nor do I have his historical luck to be in the right place at the right time with the trains and all--I'm not Stephen King either and that puts me at the mercy of a short-sighted and sadly-ignorant woman who doesn't deserve to have the genius of a husband she was fortunate enough to have trapped into that blissful state of matrimony she enjoys.Moi.Mike doesn't take notice of other things, either, that might have a positive influence on his career decisions. Like the times I've put on hold the important work I'm doing to go out and get a job in what usually turns out to be a vain attempt to keep Belinda from her constant yammering. More than once, I've sacrificed my call to the inventing/idea profession to simply shut her up and gain a bit of peace in the household.Pacify the witch!!! is a crude, but accurate way of describing the sacrifices I make many times!!!A good example was the time I became a genealogist. It wasn't my first choice, but after poring over the help wanted ads for several weeks and not finding anything I could put my unique abilities and talents to use in, I spotted what seemed at the time to be an interesting offer. It even seemed to be intellectually-challenging and that's what I was after more than anything else. Some kind of work that would stimulate the ol' gray matter, get the lead out, so-to-speak, to coin a phrase.What the ad wanted was a person who could assist this guy in researching his family's history.Detective work.Oh, sure--I figured some of the work would involve boring computers and probably even being stuck in some musty library poring over faded marriage certificates illegibly-written in Olde English and such--but I sensed there might be some travel involved too, and probing interviews with all kinds of interesting people, some of whom might even be famous. If I was lucky, maybe the guy (his name was Aaron B. Rodthistle, according to the ad), would discover he had some one hundred and two-year-old great-aunt or a fifth-cousin living in Bimini and I'd be dispatched to gather vital information from her before she shuffled off her mortal coil (whatever that is!!!) and the critical info was lost forever.Would I bring my swimsuit to that interview? You decide!Yeah, well, was I fooled…As it turned out, my first hunch was correct. I spent days and days at the downtown library--the main branch where all the genealogy stuff was kept--and mostly what I did was walk around asking dumb questions of people in the genealogy department who didn't know squat about genealogy. Look over there,\" was their most common answer, pointing to some bookshelf way in the back, looked like you should take a cab to get to. \"Look under R.\"I'd hike my way down to the spot indicated, weaving around the winos who used the library for their naps, only to find sixteen books of Rodthistles alone. I'm supposed to wade through all that, I thought? Yeah, right.Realizing it was a hopeless cause, I decided to use my time more constructively than in some useless rummaging around in a bunch of moldy books that were hopelessly out-of-date and probably about a different branch of the Rodthistle family than the one I was supposed to research. I'd been working on a process to keep unsightly dandruff off of executives' suit shoulders and was close to a breakthrough. My inventor's instincts told me the solution was hidden somewhere within the magical and fascinating worlds of electro-magneticism and molecular chemistry. Some compound that would repel the nasty flakes away from the material in suit jackets. I knew the answer lay in something simple that no one had thought of. A combination of two common household elements that, if the suit was simply and easily treated with the formula, would cause the offending particles to fly off in the opposite direction like steel shavings do when they come into close proximity with a negative magnet. Something like that. A solution, so simple in hindsight, that I'd smack my forehead in rueful, self-deprecating humor, exclaiming something out loud like, \"Boy-o-boy! Doesn't that beat all! This was right in front of my very nose all the time!\" A humorous anecdote I could use in my speech should I find myself in Stockholm, accepting a certain very well-known prize… I can see my idea culminated symbolically and expressively in my imaginative mind. It appears to me as a cartoon, in which a delighted Armani-clad CEO is watching tiny flakes whiz away from him, disappearing in a mist of white and falling harmlessly to the floor as he stands outside his firm's board room, a sign informing, \"IMPORTANT MEETING TODAY!!! BE THERE OR BE SQUARE!!! I find it hard sometimes to articulate exactly what I see in my head, but it doesn't matter, as I know exactly what I'm seeing and that's all that really matters for the inventing process. If I can see it, I can do it. Ghandi or Vince Lombardi or someone like that said that and it's true. I've even got that posted above my workspace in the garage. I typed it out and framed it and I look at it every time I go out there to work, taking a silent moment to let the words make their impact. It doesn't say, \"If I can see it, I can do it\"--substitute \"you's\" for the \"I's\" and that's what it says, literally, but you get the idea.Anyway, instead of frittering away precious research hours on Mr. Aaron B. Rodthistle's stupid family crap--the bit of investigating I did complete revealed a family tree more boring than you could possibly imagine--I invested my time instead perusing the many informative volumes in the hard science section. Once or twice, I was this close to a breakthrough, but even though I came tantalizingly near to the elusive answer I sought, I was unable to unlock the formula (that was probably right in front of that aforementioned nose!) during my time there. It wasn't wasted time, though. Not in my estimation. In my mind, every dead end you encounter leads you closer and closer to the right cul-de-sac! Take that for some constructive criticism, you \"the glass is half-empty\" negatoids!!!I may still have been employed in that useless and (in my opinion) vain work on behalf of Mr. Aaron B. Rodthistle, when one day, whilst poring over a college-level chemical text, one of the librarians who'd gotten to recognize me and knew my mission, came over and asked if I was still doing research for Aaron B. Rodthistle.\"Why, yes,\" I replied. \"I'm taking a brief sabbatical from my investigation at the moment, but shortly I'll be cracking those hundred-year-old death certificates, you bet!\"She snorted. \"You know, we all think he's a 'lune,' don't you? It's why he hired you. He won't come around here any more because we all fall down laughing every time he comes in the door.\"\"What's so funny?\"\"HE'S AN ORPHAN!\" She hooted that out and over behind the counter by the autobiographies and biographies of the famous and near-famous, I saw two librarians collapse behind the desk in paroxysms of laugher when they heard her say that.\"Why does that make him a nut?\"\"Why?\" she said. \"Why??? Why is because he isn't researching his birth parents. Couldn't care a fig about his birth parents. He's researching his adopted family.\" She pulled out a hanky and swiped at the corner of her eye. \"Father's side mostly.\"\"You're kidding,\" I said, trying to sort out what this information meant. \"Why?\"She sniggered. \"We all asked him the same thing. Know what he said?\"I didn't and admitted as much.\"He said…get this…he said his adoptive parents were his only real parents and his biological mother and father didn't count. They'd abandoned him so they didn't matter in his eyes. He only wanted to learn about his heritage…on the adopted parents' side!\" She burst into uncontrollable giggles at this last and walked away, shaking her head from side to side.Well, what could I do? I mean, the guy was an obvious Fruit Loop of the mixed nut variety. While the money was good and the work easy--if you didn't mind being bored into an early grave called \"Ennui\"!!!--in good conscience, I couldn't keep on backing up to take my check from this fool. Not to mention the harm this might do to my professional reputation should it ever leak out the inane pursuit I'd been involved in!So I quit.Do you think Belinda would have empathy for my situation?Ha!Double-ha!!I won't repeat the tirade she launched into the day she came home, expecting me to be down at the library as I had been those many long weeks (three) on behalf of Rodthistle's insane pursuit, and found me toiling furiously on the couch. Imagine that for yourself!!! It shouldn't be hard, with what you now know about the woman!And guess who had just arrived home from school in time to witness her vitriolic harangue? To behold his mom, spittle flying from her mouth as she loosed her invective on her poor, hapless, and bewildered husband?That's right. My poor, misguided, foolish, overeducated son.A front-row spectator at this unseemly, savage scene.\"You see?\" I said to him, once Belinda had left for that cushy gig she has the nerve to call \"work\" down at the Speedy Vacuum Cleaner Telemarketing Center. How one can have the balls to call a well-paid and highly-pleasurable activity \"work\" when it involves chatting for four hours with other housewives, is something I'll never understand. Getting paid good money to gossip over Ma Bell's and Glen Campbell's lines would represent a dream come true for most women of my acquaintance!!!\"You see, Mikey?\" I began, the second she slammed the door on her way to that dream job. Loosened it right off the hinges. Just another chore created for the ol' job jar for yours truly by you-know-who… It just never ends… But, I digress!!!I went on. \"Son, your daddy's plight may well become your fate, if you persist in that ill-advised course you've set sail on. You may wake up one day, forty-one and a half years old, at a time when you should be anticipating the golden years of retirement, and find yourself chained to a woman like your mother--a woman whose only aim in life is to cut her husband's balls off at the knees! That what you want? Well, Mister… that's precisely where you're headed if you stubbornly cling to this foolish school thing.\"Sensing he didn't quite grasp the same picture of his future I saw oh-so-clearly, I went on. \"It's the same old historically-proven domino effect,\" I said. \"You keep going to school, let's say. Let's suppose you even graduate from middle school. You with me so far?\"He nodded.\"The next thing you'll want to do is go to high school. Is that a fair assumption? Can you see where that might happen?\"Again, he nodded. Maybe I was getting through to him after all!!!\"Okay, then. Put yourself in the future. You're standing in a big mob of people with teal-blue robes on and mortar-boards on their heads. You've all just been praised to the rooftops by a bunch of middle-aged geezers who've spent the past two hours telling you you're the \"hope of the future\" and \"the brightest of the bright\" and other such pablum and ludicrous drivel. You're human--you like praise like all of us do--and you buy into this crapola they've been dishing out. Follow?\"He claimed he did by yet another nod.\"Right after this graduation charade, you'll probably go to some classmate's house for a big party, where you'll get drunk on 3.2 beer and wind up in a bedroom with Easy Sally, getting some honey on your stinger. I know what I'm talking about here, son. Don't ask how I know.\"Again he nodded, more vigorously than the other times and I noted he had that same gleam in his eye that he did when he found out doctors don't have time to brush their teeth.I cut to the chase.\"What'll happen after that, is that you'll get this bright idea to go on to college and what do you suppose will happen there?\"He shrugged his shoulders. I could tell from the distant look in his gaze that he was still back there with Easy Sally at the graduation party. Kids…\"I'll tell you what will happen.\" I grabbed him by his shoulders, pulled him sharply toward me until our noses were inches apart. I had his attention now!\"You'll be going to rat lab and buying into the same propaganda your mother did and your brain will atrophy away until it's the size of a diseased black walnut. What little of it you've still got, that is! You'll end up conning people on fixed incomes to purchase life insurance or maybe find yourself back at your old middle school, leading little morons down the same deadened path you just traveled on, but now on the other side of the desk as a \"teacher.\" (I spat out the last word.) \"You know what else will happen, Mike? You'll think you have to marry a girl who also has a college education. Don't smile. You will. You'll look down at those girls who had the smarts to quit school early and make something of themselves. You won't even look at the girls who could do you some good, stand by you in your climb up the 7-11 ladder of success. You'll want one of those silly college girls instead. Someone like…\" I hesitated and took a deep breath. \"… your mother. You want that?\"He didn't know what to say. He was obviously stricken by the horrible Polaroid of the fate that loomed before him that I'd just shared with him. Dazed and downhearted and woebegone. It was all over his forlorn little kisser. At that moment, I so desperately wanted to take pity on him. After all, he was my only son and I loved him to pieces! I detested having to do this to him, but the sooner he learned about the real world, the better off he'd be. The truth may hurt, but it's the truth that shall set ye free as it wisely says in Joshua or Deuterotomy or Acts 3:11, somewhere like that.\"Okay,\" I said, more gently now. \"That's one scenario. The certain fate that awaits you if you keep hopping on that yellow bus every morning.\"I waited to let that sink in before going on.\"But then…\"Once more, I outlined what could be clearly a more glorious and rewarding future in the convenience store business. When I finished, I reached behind me to the object I'd been waiting to give him. The \"deal-clincher\" as an aluminum-siding salesman would say.Without a word, I handed it to him. This was an event that needed no explanation. One of those ageless father-son ritual moments.The December issue of Playboy Magazine.The year-end, wrap-up issue, the one with the photos of all the previous year's Playmate's of the Month.\"Here, Mikey,\" I said, after giving him a moment to comprehend what he held in his hands. \"This is a glimpse at your future should you choose the right road. While other kids your age will have to sneak around to get their hands on these, you'll have free and easy access to as many as you want. While they're hiding their purloined copies under their mattresses--not knowing that's the first place parents look!--you'll be able to just casually stroll over to Aisle 6 and pick up your own copy… whenever you want!\"I waited until he looked up, my heart gladdened at the emotion I saw expressed there.\"And, best of all--you'll be getting paid serious money to read these!!! You'll also be getting paid to eat all the Slim Jims you want. I've already mentioned Slurpys--you know how much you like Slurpys!!! Hostess Ho-Ho's! At the same time you're knocking down a regular, man-sized paycheck for all this fun you'll be having, picture your former schoolmates. Hunkered down over their six-pound math books, struggling to understand something called 'quantum physics.' How many times do you suppose anyone uses quantum physics in their jobs? That should tell you something right there about the \"value\" of your so-called 'education!' Think about it. How many times do you suppose someone's boss comes up to them and says, 'Well, Ralph, you know it's time for your year-end review. If you can tell me what year Columbus sailed the ocean blue, you'll get a nice raise and that promotion you've been wanting!' Can you guess how many times that happens in the workplace, Mister Student?\"We talked some more and while I'd like to report Mike saw the wisdom of what I was telling him and quit school on the spot and went down and filled out a 7-11 app, I'd be lying. A victory of sorts was achieved, however.At the end of our talk, he agreed to at least go down and see if he could snag a part-time job after school. While this isn't the complete triumph I'd hoped for, it represents at least a partial one. I feel confident that once he's on the job and experiences the many benefits therein, he'll take that next step and apply for full-time hours.I praised him for his mature decision, and in the true nature of the born salesman which I could have been if I'd so desired, ended our talk by letting him in on yet another of the many benefits of the career he was embarking on.\"I haven't even mentioned the uniform,\" I confided. \"Women go bananas over uniforms. Picture yourself in your white shirt with the company logo stitched over the pocket and that snappy azure-blue bow tie! Think that doesn't attract the babes???!!!\"I can't wait to see his mother's face when she learns about the decision he's made.We'll soon learn who's captain of this ship! I don't think it will prove to be a certain telemarketer!!!"},
{"title": "GOLDFISH WHISPERER", "date": "Monday, March 22, 2010", "text": "Hey Campfire buddies,Since my last few posts have been on the serious side, I thought it might be a good idea to lighten up a bit. Not that I don’t take this “Goldfish Whisperer” stuff seriously—I have never taken anything more seriously in my life. Well… except maybe for Al Gore causing global warming with his enormous electricity usage…I guess I better explain what a Goldfish Whisperer is for those of you who live in the Midwest and consider terms like “white pride” to mean rotating the tires on your house once a month…It’s a relatively new profession, arriving in a natural progression from the older and better-publicized profession of “Horse Whisperer” from a movie that you may have giggled through and missed some of the defining characteristics.First came the guys (and gals—it’s not a sexist industry, so relax, NOW!) who were able to read horses' minds and converse with them in a special language only they and those folks who wear aluminum colanders on their heads to keep aliens from penetrating their brainial cavities can understand. Or appreciate. Or, even speak—very few of the words in the language contain vowels. The language, when overheard by the uninitiated, sounds like someone’s reading lists of the names of Eastern European immigrants who mistakenly went to Easter Island rather than where they intended to go—Ellis Island—and were being relocated via ships provided by the humanitarian organization, Acorn, for the purpose of giving them houses they could never pay for in return for a simple thing—their vote in an upcoming election of their choice. A truly altruistic undertaking.The next step on the journey of whisperer evolution was those folks who could speak to canines, called (cleverly!) Dog Whisperers. These talented practitioners could only speak to certain dogs, however. Namely: designer dogs. The ones that cost a boatload of money and wore precious little outfits purchased by owners who’ve spent most of their lives watching reality shows starring Paris Hilton—darling little sweaters designed by Bill Blass, intended for the harsh climate of Los Angeles and their fierce Santa Ana winds. Dog whisperers would turn up their noses if you brought in Buford, your black and tan hound for a chat! Buford doesn’t have much of a range of conversation, unless you count, “We’re low on PBR” and “Pee on your own tree!” as thoughts. No, dog whisperers commune only with French poodles and breeds like Chihuahuas (“Chihuahua” means “little rat-like yappy critter, good for barbecuing with hickory” in the Tex-Mex dialect of Odessa, Texas.From dog whispering came the next and latest step on the evolutionary tree.Goldfish whisperers.It’s an all-inclusive term, encompassing more than baby carp. However, the primary source of business for practitioners remains goldfish.Lest you think that this is a skill you, too, can learn, let me dissuade you of that notion! It’s a skill only a very few humans are blessed with. I, myself was unaware of my talents until one day I was at the home of a friend, doing research into which blends of Peruvian cannabis were the most harmful so we could warn our children, when out of the ether, I heard this voice, saying, “Don’t. Go. Near. The. Bathroom.” (It sounded exactly like Mr. Magoo during his “Blue” period. If you’re too young to remember Mr. Magoo, he was a near-sighted and highly-talented artist who sometimes painted without his glasses on and during those times went by the appellation of “Picasso.” Very famous dude, back in the “day.” Today, his art costs more than the wardrobes of many Chihuahuas.)At first, I thought it was my research pal, “Stubby” MacIntyre, but no, Stubby was catching a nap on the couch, and besides, Stubby always sounded like Peter Graves, even when he was talking in his nod, er, sleep. (Peter Graves, in case you’re too young to remember, was the guy who taught Marshall Dillon how to fast-draw. If you don’t remember Marshall Dillon, you’re in an alternate universe and none of these references will make sense, I’m afraid. You should probably get back on your spaceship before it leaves and you’re stuck here. You’ll find Monday mornings are murder on this planet, and barely tolerable.)At any rate, I thought I was dreaming my own self, when I heard the voice again. “Why don’t you buy me a girlfriend?” That’s when I knew it wasn’t Stubby as one thing Stubby is if he’s anything and that’s a realist. Never in a million years would Stubby want a girlfriend. If he had a girlfriend, he would run the risk of having her tell everyone where his nickname came from and that, as his best friend who knows things about Stub, is something I’m positive he doesn’t want to take place.I tried answering the voice. “Who are you?” I said. (I never said I was a genius detective and I never claimed to write brilliant dialogue, did I?)Surprise! The voice answered back!“I’m over here,” he said.“Over where?” I said. (Okay, okay! I’m gonna work on that dialogue thing. But, don’t kill the messenger. I’m just reporting here, trying to do my job!)I found the voice. It was a lone goldfish, swimming in Stubby’s fishbowl. It was hard to see the fish from all the smoke residue coating the glass.As it turns out, I could not only hear fish talking, but I could understand what they were saying! It was one of those moments you don’t soon forget! We chinned a bit and Fred—that’s what he told me his name was—said he was so happy I could hear him. Seems he was doing the backstroke just to kill the tedium the day before and Stubby thought he was dying and started to take him to the bathroom and do a mercy burial at sea. Fred said he realized what was happening and immediately began doing the Australian crawl and Stubby took him back. He said he didn’t know there was a human being who could understand him, but ever since he’d been repeating the same thing, over and over. “Don’t go near the bathroom.” Fred said he figured it was hopeless, but he thought his only chance at survival was the slim hope that Stubby would hear him subliminally and stay away from the bathroom.I woke Stubby up and explained everything that had happened. Stubby’s a realist if he’s anything, and he never questioned the validity of what I was laying on him, only said, “Jesus! I’ve been holding it all day! Now I can take a whiz!.”Not to bore you with everything that happened after that, other than to report (happily) that Stubby bought Fred a babe goldfish… only it turned out it was another guy, but even that turned out fine as it turns out Fred was a closet gay and never knew it until he saw that gorgeous dorsal fin on Betty (what Stubby had named his new fish.).The upshot was that I saw an upside to all this in that I decided to market myself as the “Goldfish Whisperer.” I am planning on running an ad in the L.A. Times tomorrow and hire a receptionist who can type at least 25 wpm. And file.I can provide a useful and even necessary service to mankind. When the family goes to Epcot, I can talk to their goldfish beforehand and figure out what kind of food they should tell the neighbor boy to feed him while they’re gone. I’ve been thinking. If I get really good at this stuff, I figure I can go down to the jetty at Marco Island and ask the sharks where all the pirate gold is. I’ll just promise ‘em a few homeless people to chow on. Looks like a win-win all around...Comments welcome. Just respect the profession, please."},
{"title": "CENSORSHIP AND WHY I LOVE CHARLES BUKOWSKI", "date": "Saturday, March 20, 2010", "text": "(Another long post, boobies!)CENSORSHIP AND WHY I LOVE CHARLES BUKOWSKIByLes Edgerton(Lecture Delivered to MFA in Writing Students & Faculty at Vermont College, January 8, 1997)(Just before I delivered my graduating lecture in the MFA program, I was amazed to see the lecture room completely full and people outside the room everywhere--clear up the stairs outside and twenty deep in the hall. A virtual sea of people. Good thing I wasn't shy... Pam Painter, one of my workshop leaders (Pam is also on the faculty at Emerson College and is the coauthor of the wonderful writer's text, WHAT IF?), came up to me and said, \"Les, I've taught here since the program began and this is the single biggest turnout I've ever seen. This is amazing!\" It was. I was proud and humbled at the same time. Also, the lecture pissed a few people off and that's a good thing.Also, please note that I gave this lecture thirteen years ago. I'm curious to see if you think things have changed since then and if so, in what direction?)Lecture:Like most of you in this room, I’ve always written, always had to write. I had this thing inside me that said I had to be a writer. Notice, I said had to be. Not “wanted” or “yearned to be”. Had to be. There was no choice in the matter. God looked down and saw this little runty red thing laying in his bassinet, sucking down a PBR with a formula chaser, and He said, “I need another writer for my Grand Scheme,” and Bingo! There I was. A writer. When God Himself says you’re gonna be a writer, then, boy, you better be a writer. You play the hand you’re dealt.I didn’t have any argument with that. I mean, who argues with God? Except, maybe Francois Camoin. But I didn’t have the advantage of being French and cynical and all that like Francois did- I didn’t even know where to begin to buy a beret or a black painter’s smock or an attitude. I mean, for Christ’s sake, I was a kid in Texas. None of those things could be gotten in Texas. If you couldn’t barbecue it or shoot it, fuck it or ride it, forget it. Not available west of the Pecos.So I had to be a writer who grew up in Texas and my opportunities were pretty limited because of that.Unfortunately, I was the product of a traditional American education. I say “unfortunately” because the literature I was exposed to in that system included what might be termed “safe” writers. Thackery, Milton, Shakespeare, Melville, Whitman, Steinbeck, Faulkner...you know the list. It’s the list we’ve all been exposed to.I tried. Believe me, I tried. But my models for writing were all wrong, in a way. They were guys like Balzac and Dickens, Henry James and Jonathon Swift. Ladies like Louisa May Alcot. Great writers, sure, but from another planet as far as I was concerned. I grew up in a bar, saw my first man killed when I was twelve - shot six feet in front of me. I was the night dispatcher for my grandmother’s cab company when that happened and had to phone the police. Nothing like that ever happened in Little Women, near as I could tell.One by one, I tried all the genres and styles I became exposed to and one thing or the other doomed each experiment. I mean, I loved the books I read and of course I tried imitating them in style and content, but even though they were wonderful books, they weren’t about worlds I inhabited. I guess I assumed you weren’t allowed to write about the planet I happened to find myself on.I just didn’t realize you were allowed to write about real life, at least life as I knew it. It was my first brush with censorship, although I didn’t know it. Our local public library, which was my only source of reading material just didn’t carry anything in the contemporary realism category. Looking back, I know now the head librarian hancho probably felt those kinds of books would damage my tender and developing character, so even if they had such books on their shelves, they were kept from youngsters like myself.So, for years, I continued writing what I thought was the only kind of stuff that could get published and little by little became more and more disillusioned with writing and literature in general. Perhaps if I had gone to college at an earlier age, I might have discovered there were books out there to which I could relate, but I didn’t. I was in the Navy and then in prison, and in those kinds of environments you just don’t run across literature that’s much different than what you’d find on your average high school English recommended reading list.I quit writing for a number of years, because, frankly, I was bored. It was by chance only that I came upon a writer who relit the literary fires.Charles Bukowski.Wow.Lights went off.This guy was doing things I didn’t know you were allowed to do. He was writing about life, about real life. Nitty-gritty, down and dirty life. Lots of it was funny, most of it was sad, but it all touched me, way down deep there in that literary G-spot all writers (and readers) are forever trying to connect with.I read another guy about the same time that turned me on fire inside as well. Kurt Vonnegut. I read this interview in the Paris Review in which he said, “Literature should not disappear up its own asshole, so to speak.” Big spark of understanding there. Ol’ Kurt said exactly what I had been unable to articulate for a long time, ever since I started reading the “masters.” The old boys (and girls) had some good stuff going for them, but it seems like literary sphincterism had set in by the time I came along, all these deified contemporary writers were sitting around contemplating their own navels, it seemed. I was reading all this stuff about upper-middle class angst. Really jazzy stuff, like how some guy was sorrowing because all he had out of life was his Chrysler agency and ten million bucks and was searching his soul and was in this big blue funk because he hadn’t gone off with Easy Sally that time at the senior prom way back in H.S. Every book I picked up at that period seemed to have a similar theme. I just couldn’t identify. Hell, I never was able to afford a used Chrysler, let alone an entire agency, and I had run off with Easy Sally--yeah, I was that guy, the one in the leather jacket and the slicked-back hair--really! I had hair, back then--and believe me there isn’t a lot of angst to be used for material in the writing trade when you’re sitting in the trailer and Easy Sally is looking like Even Easier Sally and you don’t know where your next PBR is coming from and the TV is flashing those little tornado warnings across the bottom of the screen and you’re trying to quiet the little rascal on your knee that has your last name but the propane delivery man’s hook nose. I just knew somewhere deep inside my bones I couldn’t fake writing a whole, entire book out of what it meant to be the Executive Vice President in Charge of Sales for Southeastern Florida for the Tidy Bowl Corp and sorrowing over the lost babe of his childhood or the sad fact that he’d chucked it all and gone off to paint Tahitian sunsets. Or that his wife had. Crap like that.All of a sudden, here’s this guy Bukowski writing about shit I knew about. About whores and hustlers, winos and fathead bosses who were always worried their wives would go to bed with the help so they got their mad out in the open right away.I picked up a book of his, a collection of stories called “The Most Beautiful Woman in Town and Other Stories.” I loved those other stories. It was like sitting down with a homeboy or your rap partner in the joint and swapping lies. Better yet; it was entertaining. All of a sudden, I remembered why I had first started writing. To make someone laugh. Or cry. Learn something about another human being. Just feel something. Feel what I was feeling. Here was this guy, Bukowski, and he was doing exactly what I’d always wanted to do.Bukowski’s stories weren’t about middle-aged English professors who were all in a fret because their wives no longer get excited sitting around listening to them conjugate French verbs and deducing that their lives, the meaningful portions of them, anyway, were over. Some of these guys, it seemed, took 400 pages to figure out why the major babe in their life was leaving. They were bored, Jack.*     *     *I know this was billed as a lecture on censorship and you may be wondering where the censorship angle comes in. Well, where it comes in is that not only were folks like Bukowski not being published by so-called “respectable” presses in this country, but other books by writers like him were not generally available to people like myself. They weren’t talked about by our English teachers, they weren’t on the shelves of our hometown libraries--or if they were, they were kept from our view and knowledge. In other words, there was a form of censorship operating that kept this kind of book from me and others that exists today and it is this and other forms of censorship, overt and covert, that I’ll get to, by and by. I want to show what it is about Bukowski that turned my whole life around. Well, not my life--I mean, I still have to mow the grass on Saturday and take out the garbage--but this story saved my writing life, which is, after all, the only life worth having.The story was The Fiend. You may have read it. If you did, you either became a fan of Bukowski’s or you hated his guts. Personally, I became a fan.Basically, it’s a story about a middle-aged guy named Martin Blanchard, who’s been defeated by alcohol. He’s lost his wife and family, two wives, two families, actually, his job, everything. Twenty-seven jobs he’s gone through. That’s a lot of jobs. This guy’s just your basic average slob who can’t leave the juice alone. He’s reduced to living in this squalid apartment, four flights up, and drinking wine. His only source of income are his unemployment checks and money left in parking meters. Badly educated, yet he listens to classical music, preferring Mahler.He begins to notice this little girl outside playing. He begins to notice she has on these interesting panties...and... you guessed it, he finds himself masturbating. Afterward, he feels relief. It’s out of my mind, he thinks after he gets off. I’m free again. Only, he’s not. It’s just the beginning of a new obsession, a perversion. For the first time in months, perhaps years, he has an interest. It repels him, but he can’t resist it, either.At first, he thinks it’s just something weird that overtook him and now it’s out of his system, but after he drinks his last bottle of wine, he sees the little girl outside in the street and begins to get hard again. He decides to go to the store to replenish his wine supply and as he walks outside he notices the little girl and the two little boys have gone into the garage across the street. He finds himself walking into the garage behind them and shutting the doors.He then proceeds to rape the little girl, in very graphic detail. When you read this part, if it doesn’t make you sick, you’re probably beyond the kind of help counseling can give you at this late date. All the while he’s committing this heinous act, the two boys are asking him questions. They express genuine curiosity and don’t seem to be overly-frightened, exhibiting more of an amoral attitude than anything. Bukowski does something quite skillful here. Instead of having the two young boys be scared shitless, he shows them to be mainly curious about what Martin is doing to their friend. These kids are witnessing something pretty horrible, but then they’re just kids, and there’s an amoral innocence about their reaction that blurs the morality. Raping a child is without doubt a truly horrible crime, with no redemption in such an act, but since it’s hard to wholeheartedly condemn the two boys the reader is moved into an area of moral ambiguity that creates a kind of complicity with the boys. The reader then becomes, like the boys, a kind of voyeur to Martin’s act. This also helps humanize the monster Martin is, inasmuch as any such person could be seen as having human qualities.The kicker for me in this story was a line a little earlier on in the story, as Martin is kissing the child, just before he rapes her, and the narrator says, “Martin’s eyes looked into her eyes and it was a communication between two hells--one hers, the other his.” When I read this line, it was as if I’d been struck by literary lightening.What I have always thought good writing was about was people, all kinds of folks, and what made writing about people good, was that it showed you something about them. Something you didn’t know or were confused on or were ignorant of. And not just politically correct folks, either. In fact, preferably not politically correct folks. Is there a more boring bunch in the Solar System? You see, I was in jail, I was an alcoholic, I was a drug user, I was all those kinds of dudes that aren’t allowed to buy a house in Westchester County--well, that’s not right, exactly, according to my New York friends, most of the citizens in Westchester fit that description--but you know what I mean--and I knew they weren’t all weak or stupid or worthless. They didn’t all start out that way. Something happened along the road. Some of the most intellectual conversations I’ve ever heard were in soup kitchens. I met a guy once who used to teach physics at M.I.T., one fine Thanksgiving Day at the free turkey blowout the Salvation Army was hosting in Baltimore. This guy could make hydrogen bombs in his sleep and probably cure cancer if he got a year off the sauce.Anyway, back to Bukowski and his story about the child rapist. Bukowski doesn’t excuse this motherfucker, nor make him out to be anything but the monster he is, but he does show us something about the guy which we probably wouldn’t have known in any other way. He shows us there’s a human being running around inside the guy someplace. A somewhat troubled human being, but one of us at any rate. And this is what literature should be all about. Showing us to one another. The good, the bad, the ugly as well as the downright perverts.All his stuff isn’t good. In fact, a lot of it stinks. Kind of masturbation-on-the-page type of stuff. He considers himself a genius--well, he is, actually--and Bukowski seems to have thought that everything he had a thought on was important because it came out of his brain. Not true. That virtually everything he wrote got printed may not have been his fault, but more the fault of publishers who bought into his self-created myth.Almost any other writer that this same story would have occurred to, would have taken the point of view of anyone but Martin’s. The little girl herself, the boys, the cops who came and arrested him, the parents. An adult who discovered the crime. A fly on the wall. To write this kind of story from the pov of the perp, in my mind, is the stuff of literary courage. It’s very dangerous stuff. It you don’t bring it off, it almost makes the writer appear as if he excused Martin for what he’s done, which would have made Bukowski an even bigger monster than his character. What he’s been able to do is present Martin exactly as he is - a hideous member of the human race...but amazingly, yet...still a member of humanity. It’s interesting in one respect, too, in that Bukowski wrote this story in the third person, while most of his other writing is first person and confessional autobiography. It looks as if he wanted to make sure readers didn’t confuse the narrator with the author, which, if he did, renders him just a little less courageous. I don’t want to think of him that way, so I’ll give him the benefit of the doubt.With that one little sentence, “Martin’s eyes looked into her eyes and it was a communication between two hells--one hers, the other his.”, Bukowski gives us an insight that is deeply profound. And that, in my opinion, is what great writing is all about.It takes enormous courage to be able to write about the kinds of people Bukowski does. Readers, even intelligent readers, tend to associate the writer with the narrator. In my first semester, I wrote a story about a character who was a criminal, and I had the concern that the reader of the piece would want to know if I had been a criminal myself. I addressed my concern to my first adviser here, Phyllis Barber, and she said, “An intelligent reader will never ask if a piece of writing is autobiographical, so don’t worry about it.” Well, Phyllis meant well, and in a perfect world, this would be true, but believe me, even very intelligent readers at least wonder if the stuff they’re reading comes from the writer’s own experience and even the brightest of readers will wonder if very negative or dark stuff is what the author really thinks and feels. It’s just human nature. It’d be nice if readers accepted work labeled as fiction as just that--fiction--but the truth of the matter is, there’s something of the prurient in all of us that makes us hope that the stuff on the page--especially the dark, forbidden stuff--is derived from the real experience of its creator. It gives most of us a delicious little shiver of horror to be standing this close to depravity without actually having to get any of it on ourselves. There is some part of almost all our souls that craves the darker side of life. We are alternately titillated and repulsed by immoral behavior and I think that is the reason books and stories and movies about bad guys are so well-attended. We can satisfy this baser part of our souls in a safe and acceptable manner, so long as they get put in their places in the end.Most of my own writing output has been about such people, and without exception, those who read it and are acquainted with me, will come up and ask, in almost an embarrassed fashion, “Was that yourself you were writing about?” Up until just recently, I would usually answer that, uh, no, I just know some people like that. I’ve usually taken the coward’s way out. Just recently, I’ve begun to admit that, yes, I’ve done many of the things that show up in my stories. I’ve been a criminal, done time, sold drugs, been involved in various sexual aberrations, broken many and diverse laws. I don’t do them any more--well, not as many--I’d be room temperature by now if I’d continued doing some of the things I used to. And, I’m a different person than I was when I was involved in those things. That’s why I’ve usually lied when asked if the author of my work was the same as the narrator. Most folks, no matter what they say, will assume you’re still that kind of person and that kind of reputation will keep you from getting some of the nicer rewards of our civilization.The thing that writers like Bukowski represent to me is truth. As a group of animals endowed with a superior intellect--as compared with, say, monkeys or tse-flies--and if we do indeed have this intelligence, then what we ought to be about primarily is the pursuit of truth. This is what education should be about, although sadly, it seems not to be the Holy Grail it once was. Back in “my day” which was the nineteen-sixties, that’s what a lot of us were interested in. Truth. We were into toppling institutions. Institutions we felt were based on lies. And, I guess that’s why writers like Bukowski appeal to me so much. The one thing we weren’t being in the sixties was safe. Although, that’s not entirely true. There was a large contingent of folks that were concerned mainly with making sure they didn’t go to Vietnam and get shot at. A lot of the hyperbole in that era was, in fact, centered around changing a system that could put one’s physical unit in jeopardy. But for many of us, especially those of us who had been in the military at the time, the things we were involved in were anything but safe. That’s what seems to be missing today. Most of the stuff I pick up and read, while quite good in many instances, is for the most part, safe writing. The mood has changed, as it always does, but the direction it has moved to is a dangerous one.I’m speaking here of the phenomenon sweeping through this country referred to as being “politically correct.” Like many grandiose ideas, there is a noble intent at the center of this outlook, but also like many other popular notions, it has been perverted until it is the antithesis of what it originated as. Being PC nowadays amounts to out and out censorship in my opinion. For every writer like Bukowski, William Vollmann, and David Sedaris who breaks through and becomes a cult hero, there are hundreds of writers who are being stifled, vilified, and destroyed, simply because they do not preach the party’s message nor do they conform to the parameters set up by the PC folks who seem to be in charge. Too often they are stifling themselves by trying to placate society. What used to be considered simply bad taste nowadays takes on a more sinister connotation and that is dangerous if we value freedom of thought and value the time-honored tradition of the debate of ideas which is the only viable method for advancing knowledge and understanding.Plato himself spoke about political correctness in The Republic, when he said:“Then the first thing will be to establish a censorship of the writers of fiction, and let the censors receive any tale of fiction which is good, and reject the bad; and we will desire mothers and nurses to tell their children the authorized ones only.” How about that.In another of Bukowski’s stories, 3 Chickens, he continually beats his girlfriend. Definitely not a PC story. Here are some direct quotes from the story:once she was screaming these insanities from the fold-down bed in our apartment. I begged her to stop, but she wouldn’t. finally, I just walked over, lifted up the bed with her in it and folded everything into the wall.then I went over and sat down and listened to her scream.but she kept screaming so I walked over and pulled the bed out of the wall again there she lay, holding her arm, claiming it was broken.andnow, another time she angered me and I slapped her but it was across the mouth and it broke her false teeth.I was surprised that it broke her false teeth and I went out and got this super cement glue and I glued her teeth together for her. it worked for awhile and then one night as she sat there drinking her wine she suddenly had a mouthful of broken teeth.the wine was so strong it undid the glue. it was disgusting. we had to get her some new teeth, how we did it, I don’t quite remember, but she claimed they made her look like a horse.andthe bar was full, every seat taken. I lifted my hand. I swung. I backhanded her off that god damned stool. she fell to the floor and screamed.There are more abusive incidents in the story. This is horrible stuff to anyone--and I imagine that’s most of us--who is interested in consciousness-raising about spouse abuse and battering--but there is a value to being exposed to this kind of material. How else can we understand anything about violence unless we observe and portray it accurately? It exists, just as surely as serial killers exist, and how can one combat evil unless one understands its nature?Gordon Weaver, who was on the faculty here at Vermont until a few years ago, told me in an interview, that, “If our special interest, as writers and/or editors, is the precise use of language toward the end of a viable perception of and effect on reality, we may argue there is some virtue implicit in any utterance (written or oral) that confronts the consensus of any gathering.” He gives an example. “There is a cost that will be paid by all concerned if one tells a Polack joke in the presence of Poles, but I contend the cost is greater if one stifles or sanitizes the anecdote.” Gordon has something here, I think. Weaver also told me that academicians are perhaps the newest bullies on the censorship block and perhaps the most dangerous of all. He stated that, “There is a greater danger, it seems to me, when the censors come from the ranks of the presumably ‘enlightened’. It is not surprising that a number of college and university communities nurture factions who wish to control free speech; it is unsettling when more sophisticated citizens (faculty) add their clout to movements desiring to police our utterance in the interests of what minority or another deems politically incorrect.”Whether or not you agree with writers like Bukowski, or Weaver for that matter, is unimportant. What is important is that they and others of diverse opinions have a forum to be heard and read. That forum is disintegrating under the onslaught of those who wish to stifle speech that disagrees with theirs. Truth is in danger of being extinguished, and it may fall to us who write to be the last vanguard of free speech. That is why writers such as Bukowski need to be published and need to be read by establishment presses and before they’re dead. There are some of us who feel we are plunging back into a Dark Age. History would confirm that to be so. After nearly every period of enlightenment, anarchy prevails again for awhile, and this is what I see us heading toward, as a nation and as a world.It is the nature of groups to want to stifle opposing viewpoints. In this country, supposedly the land of free speech, attempts at suppression have been with us since the adoption of the First Amendment, but the preponderance of that type of activity has been traditionally borne by extremists of the far right and far left political and societal spectrum. Those with the hot fire of righteousness in their bellies have been the usual standard-bearers for the termination of ideas contrary to their agenda and such should probably be expected.Gordon Weaver told me that although he dislikes boorish and bigoted expressions, he sees a greater danger in disallowing their spokesmen an opportunity to be heard.“The censors will always be with us,” he said. “It is the nature of both institutions and individuals to desire the silence of those they wish to suppress. Institutions with political power or ambitions for same (government, churches, schools) can probably be fended off--as they have been in modern times at least--by organized responses. The American Civil Liberties Union has a pretty good record in this regard. Simple crackpots (racists, militant feminists, and other self-appointed arbiters of community morality) seem to wither away if studiously ignored.”Repression comes in many forms, not always overt. Kathleen M. Sullivan, a professor of law at Harvard Law School, in talking about the censorship issue as it affects funding for the NEA, says of the PC issue, “An artist who receives a check in the mail (from the NEA) with a ‘hit list’ of forbidden ideas attached will forego too much valuable and innovative expression for fear it will come too close to the line. As (US Supreme Court) Justice Thurgood Marshall once put it, the problem with a ‘sword of Damocles is that it hangs--not that it drops.’”Fred Grandy, former actor on the Love Boat and now a Congressman from Iowa, says, “I am no artist and have 10 years on TV to prove it. But I have spent enough of my life around creative minds to know that you cannot have art without risk. You cannot write language proscribing the human imagination that will not turn artists away in droves.”Speaking of Congress in terms that could be applied to college professors and publishers as well, Grandy said, “Trying to eliminate smut by allowing Congress to tell America what is and is not artistic is as misguided as attempting to legislate patriotism by amending the Constitution to prohibit flag burning.”And publishers. How do they, as deciders of what news is fit to print, view the censorship debate? Reactions range from the moderately perplexed to the horrified doomsayers.Robert McDowell, who publishes the Story Line Press, wrote an opinion piece for the Register-Guard in Eugene, Oregon, which perhaps synopsizes the publisher’s view. “The debate pits a democratic majority believing in our First Amendment rights of free speech against a well-financed and well-organized minority extolling the virtues of all that is wholesome and the government’s right to control the subject matter of the books we read, the music we enjoy, the paintings and plays we experience.” McDowell calls Senator Jesse Helms and other individuals and groups’ efforts to censor materials funded by the NEA, “the most severe legalized censorship in this country since the McCarthy era,” and labels such censorship efforts as being “shameful attacks on free speech and the artist’s right to represent the truth as he or she perceives it.”Pulitzer-Prize-winning novelist, Larry McMurtry, in a Washington Post article, accused the Jesse Helms-led forces of attempting to “eliminate all sex from American art if they can. Rembrandt’s sketch of a fully clothed heterosexual couple attempting the missionary position behind a bush would likely not be thought fund-worthy by Helms, whose stated preferences would limit us to snow scenes, pictures of bird dogs or romantic landscapes involving, if possible, humble tobacco farms.” McMurtry goes on, “The narrative as these individuals see it, in their determination to tell Americans what they need and don’t need in the way of publicly funded art, is rigidly chaste: no public money for anything with sex in it! (They may claim that (they) only want to withhold public money from art that depicts or describes ‘wrong’ sex-- i.e., homeoerotic (no grants to Leonardo or Proust!) sadomasochistic (no Westerns, no film noir), exploitive of children (no Lolita, no Lewis Carroll), but it’s clear that they really mean to eliminate all sex from American art if they can.”Kathleen Sullivan puts it even more succinctly, when she says, “A free society can have no official orthodoxy in art any more than in religion or politics. And in a free society, such orthodoxy can no more be purchased by power of the purse than compelled by power of the sword.”Just a couple of years ago, Stanley Banks, Kansas City playwright and poet, offered the balance of such cost: “We will begin to see dull art which has no freshness of vision. Certain points of view will be silenced. When that happens our society will be seriously threatened without a bomb being blasted.” He warns us not to “call for laws to censor artists who challenge our consciousness in ways that might be uncomfortable, irritating, risqué, etc. For those who don’t want to see or hear or read about acts or points of view contrary to their own, he advises, “simply don’t look, buy it or let the kids have access to it!”Banks’ “dull art which has no freshness of vision” is already upon us. It has always been with us, since censorship in one form or another has always been around--it has only increased mightily in the past few years. The result is art which is becoming blander and blander, much resembling the “art” that was allowed to surface in totalitarian governments such as the USSR of a few years past and in many other governments. America is not yet at that stage, but if current developments continue in publishing, in the university, and in government, we are not far from achieving total censorship, imposed by the group in control.What scares me the most is that universities should be the bastion of free thought but the state of the matter is that free debate of ideas is rapidly disappearing from the college campus. As more and more writers come out of university settings and are being influenced by teachers with a decided political bent, the writing they produce becomes more and more insipid. These same writers take over the litmags and editor positions at publishing houses and impose their political beliefs on those who submit, publishing only those that can pass the PC test in the content of their creative material. As Kurt Vonnegut said in a quote cited earlier, “Literature should not disappear up its own asshole, so to speak.” Well, it’s in great danger of doing just that. It’s about halfway up the anus.In interviewing folks for an article I wrote on censorship for Circle K Magazine, I was referred to the brother-in-law of a friend of mine, an Australian, who was teaching physics and doing research at one of America’s leading universities which I cannot name because I’ve promised him anonymity. This man says, “I think it’s a myth that censorship doesn’t exist on college campuses. I believe universities should be places where anybody can say whatever they want and everybody should be very tolerant, but it’s just not true. Students are punished for saying certain things. You could say whatever you wanted at the University of Sydney (where he’s from). They were much more tolerant there. In student publications there was much less concern about libel, for example. The litigation aspect puts a lot of pressure on what ideas you can express.” This man only agreed to give me his views when I swore several times I wouldn’t use his name or even tell what university he was at, for fear of losing his job. It’s a sad day when a person from another country is allowed a greater freedom of expression there than in his adopted country which professes to be the freest nation on earth.This professor went on to say, “I think there’s more of a tradition in European-style universities for freedom of speech--that that’s what universities are for. In America, the impression I get is that universities are for other purposes...for training professionals and for football games. It’s not about intellectual freedom. You pay us (educators) your money and you want something at the end. You want a guaranteed elite job in society, and it has nothing to do with expanding your mind. You’re buying a product. It’s more of a consumer orientation.”He adds, “The government is trying to censor more and more science that they are actually paying for. For example, on sensitive subjects as global warming, the government wants to see research results first, because of the possible political consequences.”Americans should be ashamed when they have prided themselves on theirs being the leading example of a free society, when others in the world community may be seeing us very differently, as evidenced by my anonymous critic and source.Anita Manning, writing for USA Today, says that the issue is different in colleges than it is in the lower levels of education.“In K through 12, there is a school board or some sort of governing body that chooses what books are included in the curriculum...whereas in the college setting, the individual professor or instructor chooses the books for that course and students choose whether or not to take the course, leading to entire different issues.”In June, 1992, Brenda Suderman, acting media relations officer for The Bulletin, the student newspaper at the University of Manitoba in Winnipeg, reported that the university deleted about 170 files containing material on sexual bondage and pornography from the Internet computer system the university subscribes to. Gerry Miller, Director of Computer Services, made the decision in consultation with Terry Falconer, Vice-President (administration), saying the material was removed because “we felt they (the deleted files) didn’t support the mission of the university and we felt they were objectionable.”Alisa Smith, co-editor of The Marlet, the student newspaper at the University of Victoria in British Columbia, published what university officials deemed objectionable material as exampled by a lesbian, gay, bisexual issue put out in 1991 which featured male and female genitalia on the cover. About 2,000 copies were thrown into dumpsters by campus traffic and security functionaries upon administrative order. Even so, Smith feels the press is becoming a bit freer. (Yeah, well--go figure…)She says, “The mainstream media is covering a lot of issues that only the alternative press used to cover. I suppose the backlash against political correctness is sort of an attempted censorship, like trying to silence people, but not by directly shutting down their newspapers. (Universities) are trying to shut down thought, rather than newspapers. All the articles that you see are about how PC’s have sort of gotten a grip on society and how people can’t say what they want anymore. I guess it’s like a left-wing phenomenon.”Let money talk, though, and censorship takes on yet another clever form: the economic kind.“Personally,” says Smith, “I think the biggest form of censorship right now is the fact that the economy is so bad, making advertising really hard to come by. A lot of papers used to have a fairly idealistic boycott list for advertising that they wouldn’t use because of things those advertisers were funding--like nuclear systems contracting or because they were pro-apartheid in South Africa. Editors are finding they can’t make ideological choices any more because of monetary pressure. If you’re really dependent on advertising dollars, you have to basically write the kinds of things that won’t offend your advertisers and don’t disagree with their stances.”This latter statement seems to contrast with her earlier one that “the press is becoming a bit freer,” and is perhaps a good example of why censorship is unnecessary. If you allow anyone to talk freely long enough, they may provide sufficient evidence by their own words that they should not be taken that seriously when giving us the benefit of their opinion.Fearful of bad publicity during stressful economic times, it is not so surprising college and university administrations are increasingly acting to suppress anything that might bring adverse publicity to their campuses. What is surprising is that faculty members are increasingly joining in, even in the supercharged Politically Correct environment that has permeated most higher-education campuses in one way or another.A 1992 incident at Nicholls State University in Thibodaux, Louisiana, exemplifies the debate and poses difficult and perplexing arguments for both sides of the issue.A cartoon ran in the student newspaper, the Nicholls Worth, poking fun at three black singers in a rap group that had performed on campus. Black students who were offended, protested by burning about 150 copies of the paper publicly. Their complaint was that they were greatly upset by the exaggerated features of the cartoon figures and the stereotypes it reinforced. Eric Knott, president of a black fraternity denied that the protest had anything to do with being politically correct.“I’m not one to hide behind racism and claim that everything in society is racist, (but) the cartoon clearly degraded the black race,” Knott says.Marty Authement, student editor of the paper, said that he “used poor judgment” in allowing the cartoon to be published, but was also concerned that “political correctness is limiting what journalists can do. These days you have to be more sensitive than you usually would be. If you live by the strict law of political correctness, there’s not much left.”I had a very jarring and dismaying experience with PCism with my own novel THE DEATH OF TARPONS. A few years before it actually got published, a regional publisher in the Southwest wanted to buy it for a $10,000 advance. A very few months before this offer, I was sleeping on a garage floor in California and eating out of a Bob’s Big Boy dumpster, so the money he offered had the same value as a million dollars to me. I almost signed the contract until the publisher said, “Well, we have to change a lot of this. There’s stuff in here that might make certain folks upset.” He gave as an example a scene in which the boy’s father whips him with a live king snake. This might offend the snake lovers, he said. That’s got to be what?--seven or eight in the U.S.A.? Not counting, of course, the folks who use them in church services. He cited about twenty other scenes I’d have to change because they might offend this person or that. Reluctantly, I withdrew the book, not knowing if it would ever be published, and indeed, it was another five years before I found a publisher who wasn’t as concerned about snake lovers’ feelings and was more concerned with putting out a book that she felt had literary value.Mind you, this was several years before the wholesale PC attitude took over the country. This asshole--and I don’t excuse myself from the term--was merely the forerunner of what is a terrifying fact of life today.If you believe this to be the ravings of a paranoid mind, consider these facts:A record 348 incidents of attempted censorship occurred in the 1991-92 school year, according to The American Way, a liberal watchdog group. That’s an increase of 20% over the previous high, a figure they claim poses an alarming advance in assaults on a basic Constitutional right--a right almost universally assured in most of the free world.The Literary Network, a project jointly administered by Poets&Writers, Inc. and the Council of Literary Magazines and Presses report over 6,000 attempts to remove books from shelves in American libraries in the 1980’s and ‘the number of incidents is noticeably on the rise.”Concerned Women for America, a conservative, pro-family group asserts all censorship attempts are not necessarily bad. Caia Mockaitis, speaking for the organization, says the issue is one of selection, not censorship, many times, in that “there are some materials that are appropriate for kids and some that are not,” no matter what adults’ political bias, liberal or conservative.Mockaitis has plenty of like-minded supporters. Censorship attempts at banning outright or restricting access to books and magazines in secondary school libraries were successful in nearly one-half of instances between 1987 and 1990, reports a University of Wisconsin survey of 6,600 schools. Challenged publications were removed 26 percent of the time, restricted by age or grade level 22 percent of the time, and more likely to occur at small schools.The book challenged most? Judy Blume’s Forever, a story of a teenage girl who loses her virginity. Sports Illustrated’s swimsuit issue and Rolling Stone were the most-challenged magazines at secondary schools, according to USA Today, Jan. 20, 1992.Consider this item: “Pornography Victims Compensation Act” was a bill on the U.S. Senate floor that would enable victims of sex crimes to file civil suits in an effort to recover damages from producers and distributors of obscene materials (including publishers, wholesalers, and booksellers) if the victims can show that the materials “caused” the crimes. This “third-party liability” bill is a way of imposing censorship through a back door. This item was reported by the American Booksellers Association.Here’s another: In May, 1990, Ferris Alexander, operator of a chain of bookstores, theaters and video stores in the Minneapolis area, was found guilty of violating the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organization Act (RICO) obscenity forfeiture law. His crime? Selling four magazines and three videotapes found to be obscene and valued at less than $200. Alexander was sentenced to six years in prison, fined $200,000 and forfeited a $25 million dollar business. This was reported by The Media Coalition.Here’s another. Three editors of the Ohio State University student newspaper, The Lantern, resign when members of the journalism faculty issue a policy statement that the faculty advisor had the authority to review articles for libel before they were published. This story from The Chronicle of Higher Education, March 4, 1992.Censorship is everywhere and rising in attempts and more frightening, in successful attempts.Free speech advocate Nat Hentoff, the author of Free Speech for Me - But Not for Thee: How the American Left and Right Relentlessly Censor Each Other from HarperCollins, feels that in too many cases, publishers, school boards and principals remove or change material for students rather than face the wrath of militant parent groups. Seeing authorities suppress ideas in some cases, and being in a school in which books keep disappearing, gives a graphic lesson to students, Hentoff feels, in that they may have doubts that theirs is a country of intellectual freedom.And it appears it is special-interest groups that are behind these efforts and that the majority of Americans are against censorship. A survey conducted by Louis Harris for the American Council for the Arts and sponsored by Phillip Morris Companies, Inc., in February, 1992, polled 1,500 adults over the age of 18 by telephone. Part of the findings were that 91% felt it important for school children to be exposed to and participate in the arts; 67% felt learning about the arts as important as learning about history and geography, 60% say as important as math and science, and 53% believe the arts are important as learning to read and write. It’s evident that it’s a small but vocal and politically-powerful group of minorities who are succeeding in censorship activities and these groups emerge from both ends of the political and societal spectrum.Virtually every publisher in the country, from the smallest litmag to the largest publishing conglomerate, is terrified of antagonizing any reader whatsoever, unless the person offended is not part of a highly-organized, highly-vocal political group. This includes both right and left-wingers. It seems everybody in America has now organized, has a group with a slogan, a newsletter, a home page on the Internet, and a secret handshake. The battle is being waged over who gets ultimate control of the presses. And it doesn’t matter who wins. We all lose. What we lose is freedom of expression. And once that happens, we are done as a free society. I go to Gordon Weaver once again, who said it as best as it can be said. “Censorship from without is bad for the language, bad for those who speak or write it; self-imposed censorship, whatever the motive is worse. If you won’t say what you think, you run the risk of losing the powers of both speech and thought. I suspect we’ll be safe just as long as we refuse to accept censorship for anyone.”Again, I quote Gordon Weaver for perhaps the best take on the situation. “If the king is naked, we’re all (including the king) better served if someone says so.”Well, the king is indeed, naked. The only problem is not enough of us are saying so, preferring to remain safe, keep our jobs, get our material published and so we go on, giving silent tacit agreement to what is happening. This is an understandable position for many in our society; it is unforgivable for writers, at least in my opinion. Writers should be like the canaries in coal mines, the warning system that things are not right and that danger looms. As a group, we have many of us become complacent, intent only on saving our professional selves at the expense of freedom of thought. Maybe we understand too well that although the canary in the coal mine provided a valuable service, in doing so he ended up room temperature.I cannot count the numbers of instances acquaintances of mine have said to me, “I cannot say certain things I believe in, to my class, my teachers, my peers, or in my writing, because I would lose my job or be censured or not see my work in print, etc. What’s wrong with us? What kinds of writers are we producing in this country that are fearful to take stands on issues they believe fervently about simply because they risk disapproval? What kind of chickenshit writer is it that the little squiggles he or she puts down on paper consist of half-truths and integrity that is compromised regularly? We are surrendering something precious more by what we don’t do than what we do. Are we so enamored of safety and comfort that we are willing to give up the freedom to express ourselves honestly? It seems that we are. It is a growing malaise that is sweeping the country and I hold that the only ones that can stem the tide are the writers in our society. But where are they?Some are out there. There are a few. William Vollmann. Brian Everson. Michael Tolkin. Bukowski. There are others that we’ll never know of because they can’t find a forum. There need to be a lot more such voices. What is really needed is for establishment forums to begin looking more at the quality of the writing than the content. To give an ear to voices that refuse to be influenced by a job, a smile from an empty-headed bureaucrat, publication in a white-bread magazine or by a bottom-line mentality of a publishing conglomerate.I think back to when I began writing as a grade school kid. One of the things I used to do was write humorous sketches of some of the more terrifying individuals I faced daily. Individuals like the bullies I and others faced, from the schoolyard rowdy to the teacher who thought her job was to intimidate her class into submission. I’d show these “pieces” to friends, they’d be passed around, and in some cases, public opinion ended those offenders’ bullying careers. Nobody likes to push someone around if he’s going to get laughed at by everyone else. It just plain takes all the power out of it, not to mention the fun.The problem today is, the bullies have taken over not only the schoolyard, but the university, the Congress, and the publishing house. Many of us in this room became writers because of a bully somewhere in their past. Maybe it was another kid, or a group of kids, or maybe it was a parent or a teacher. We found we could effectively combat these kinds of folks by the written word. If we were physically weaker we possessed a strength that was virtually indefensible against. The power of ideas, expressed upon the page and in open debate. Do we want to give up our only weapon against tyranny? I hope not.And by the way--those writers I mentioned at the beginning of this lecture--Whitman, Steinbeck, Faulkner, Thackery, Milton, Shakespeare, Melville, Alcott--and that I described as “safe”, were anything but that when they were being published. They were almost all rogues in their time and were, by turns, either censored, vilified, viewed with shock, attacked by those in power, or even unpublished in their lifetimes because of the content of their writing. It is only after many years had passed and the political climate had shifted, that the original perceptions of them and their work were considered nonthreatening enough to exist in our libraries and schools. Although many of them are still censored, even today. Steinbeck routinely makes his appearance at book-burnings and other censorship attempts, along with Faulkner, Whitman and even Shakespeare. They were “safe” to me when I read them, simply because I was reading them in a different, more removed era, but in fact, those writers who have become what we call “immortal” have largely been the risk-takers of their time, who wrote in line with their conscience, rather than the political and social mores of their period. Many of them endured great distress because what they were writing was politically incorrect at the time. The thing was, there were then and still are now, publishers who gave them a forum, often at great risk, and there were those who read them, and so the world has been enriched through those individuals’ courage. Knowing this, it would be easy to say, “well, hey, those folks got published and there are those today being published who don’t parrot the party line, so what’s the problem? The problem is, once we as writers and future editors and educators begin to think like that, complacency sets in and we get the attitude to “let someone else worry about it” and that’s when our freedom of expression becomes seriously eroded and in danger of disappearing. Freedom of expression is a value that must be continuously fought for, over and over. That war is never finished unless one side or the other lays down its arms. As part of this generation of writers, it is our duty to take up the battle.There is another point of view that says that it’s not the job of an artist to express a viewpoint or an opinion at all. While I respect the right of those who feel that way, I disagree. Indeed, is it possible to find a writer of note who hasn’t expressed his point-of-view, politically, through his or her writings? What else was Steinbeck commenting on in “The Grapes of Wrath” if not a political system? Perhaps he didn’t stand on a stump and proclaim to the world his political views but they sure are right there in his fiction. There are countless others I could give as examples and I’m sure you have your own list. Some artists feel it is their job to present a vision of the world, not a political opinion. I don’t see a difference. It seems to be a matter of semantics. What is a “vision of the world” except a political opinion? Or you might call such a view a “philosophy” but again, philosophies (in my opinion) are nothing but political ideologies dressed up in a tuxedo. I believe it all comes down to politics and I mean politics in the purest sense, as in I want mine and you want yours and I’d kill you for yours if we hadn’t agreed that we’re civilized and have figured out a way for both of us to keep our stuff and not worry about the other taking it. And, for me, that’s what censorship finally boils down to. It’s refuting the principle that I can have mine and you can’t take it and you can have yours and I can’t have it either. You can just substitute the word “opinion” for a particular possession. What I object to is the closing down of forums for all but those who agree with the body politic, not in an overt way but by more subtle and insidious means.Thank you for your time. I hope I’ve given you some food for thought. I hope you’ll read some Charles Bukowski, some William Vollmann. I don’t even care if you don’t like or agree with them. In fact, the only way this little talk will be a success if people go out of here arguing with each other. Personally, I’m like Robert Duvall in The Apocalypse Now - I love the smell of a good argument in the morning. I’d like to leave you with one of my favorite quotes. In the preface to the infamous Story of O, Jean Paulhan wrote, “Dangerous books are those that restore us to our natural state of danger.”"},
{"title": "Southern Stereotypes - This is a long one, boobies!", "date": "Friday, March 19, 2010", "text": "SOUTHERN CULTURE - BOTH REAL AND STEREOTYPICAL(As Shown Through Ellen Gilchrist’s “The Stucco House” and Robert Stone’s “The Hall of Mirrors”As a native of the American South, I am oftentimes chagrined, saddened, and even embarrassed at how Southern culture is depicted in literature, movies and other media, even in works that are accorded the mantle of superiority or even greatness. It saddens me when an inaccurate portrait is painted by an author from another culture and when the creator is himself of the South my feeling is then one of betrayal and even anger. Occasionally, someone “gets it right” and even then, after an initial feeling of gratitude, two thoughts emerge; one that not enough people read or viewed it, and; two, that they didn’t believe the picture presented because of the preponderance of material presented in a negative or dishonest manner.Stereotypes abound throughout ours and I suspect, most cultures, but it seems the culture peculiar to the South is fair game to anyone and everyone, to continue the myth, mostly negative, whereas these same authors would recoil in horror at the perpetuation of myth as pertains to say, race. (Although, it is evident that many of the Southern stereotypes are perpetuated in an attempt to counteract racial myth--a lie battling a lie, as it were)To illustrate the contrast between an accurate portrayal of Southern culture and one that conforms to popular myth, I would like to take a look at two works, Ellen Gilchrist’s short story, “The Stucco House”, and Robert Stone’s novel “A Hall of Mirrors.”Gilchrist, in my opinion, is far more the accurate of the two, in depicting the Southern culture experienced by those born and bred as Southerners (I’m not including Southerners who have been subjected (perhaps elsewhere) to a “liberal” education and seem embarrassed by their heritage, but am speaking of the “rank and file” Southerner, both poor and wealthy, black and white, male and female).Gilchrist uses both physical description of setting and telling incidents to create a highly accurate picture of the culture as it has evolved over a historical period dating from the 1600’s.One of the things one learns from living in various places in the South, is that you cannot place the entire South in one descriptive basket. There are oranges in that basket, as well as apples, bananas, pomegranates, plums, mangos, and even a breadfruit or two. True, there are some characteristics of the culture that remain constant no matter where one lives in that section of the country, but there are many mutations of the same basic culture, from state to state, sub-region to sub-region, city to country. For instance, in the state of Texas, which is actually a border area of the south, folks who live in the eastern section and central portion of the state consider themselves Southerners, while those who live in the Panhandle or northwest Texas may consider themselves Mid-Westerners or Westerners. To get even more specific, consider the almost-twin cities of Fort Worth and Dallas. Dallas folks consider themselves the elitist of all genteel Southerners, while Fort Worth natives would be horrified to be described as anything but true Westerners and cowboys. Citizens of Birmingham, Alabama are primarily Baptist in religious background, while those from New Orleans are primarily Catholic.In “The Stucco House”, the physical geography, including landscape as it is described, is not merely an exercise in physical description; it means something in relation to the characters, providing clues that, in both subtle and more overt ways, contribute to the image the reader visualizes of the characters in his mind’s eye.Many of the elements of physical description Gilchrist provides in this story are peculiar to New Orleans and the South and its attendant history and culture and will not be so readily evident to the reader not immersed in this particular society, while other such descriptive elements are more universal and will therefore be more apparent to the reader with a different experience. Some of the elements she uses in defining characters in her use of place are not evident upon an initial cursory reading, but are after completion of the reading and reflection. They serve, in the end, as a resonance to the characters, especially the principal one, Teddy, that lends a richness not available in mere physical description of his surroundings in a purely poetical or lyrical choice of words.The reader from another culture for example, may not “get” all of the properties of Gilchrist’s physical and geographical description as will someone born and raised in the New Orleans culture, but they will come away with a sense, even if inarticulated, of what Teddy and his family are, in that milieu.In the very first sentence of the story, for instance, Gilchrist signals that she is going to use physical description to place her characters in that culture. The sentence reads, “Teddy was asleep in his second-floor bedroom.” This would probably be nothing more than a “window pane description” in most other settings; in New Orleans this sentence signals two things.One, the name she has chosen for her main character provides a clue as to his place within that culture. This is one of the examples referred to earlier that is not evident upon initial reading, but becomes clear upon finishing the story. “Teddy”, the diminutive of Theodore, is a name popular among upper middle-class white families, who chose their names carefully. A Northern writer, subject to the myths he learned to accept as Southern culture, might have named the character “Delbert” or “Billy Bob” or some other such foolish handle, more common in such border areas as southern Indiana than in the South, and, if a Southern person’s name, it would be found in someone of a lower economic and social strata. By using the name Teddy, Gilchrist immediately provides a clue as to who this young boy is in class terms. She makes the decision to use the diminutive instead of the more proper “Theodore”, which might have been done if this story had been written by another writer and set in, say, Connecticut, and is another slight clue to his identity and even age. J.D. Salinger could name a character Teddy and it would be unclear as to his age without further reading--although he would probably also be of the upper middle-class bracket, but could have been a young boy or a young, wealthy roué. Names, as Gilchrist seems absolutely aware, are of great importance in dispelling myth. The South tends to get lumped into one huge androgynous mass, ignoring a huge region of the country that is vastly complex and varied. There is, for example, a difference between a factory worker living in a trailer park in Harlan, Kentucky and the wife of a newspaper owner in Athens, Georgia.Louisiana itself, is, in some ways, an aberration of what outsiders commonly think of as the South. In New Orleans, the religious background is primarily Roman Catholic (although there is a rich mix of other religions as well, including A.M.E., voodoo, Baptist, Pentecostal, Jewish and many, many others, even though it is certainly true that the defining religion is Catholic because of the Spanish and French historical influence), while in other parts of the state, particularly the northern and northwestern sections, most of the residents, black and white, favor the Southern Baptist flavor of worship. (And, too, you can find a church or two that favors rattlesnake handling and the drinking of poisonous substances as proof of their faith.) To inject a personal history, being a Southerner myself, born and raised along the Gulf coast of Texas and reared Baptist as were virtually all my acquaintances, when critics term Flannery O’Connor a “Southern writer”, I am always taken slightly aback in my mind, for wasn’t she Catholic? Indeed, and my own prejudice as to what constitutes a Southerner stems from the fact that I only ever met a real live Catholic one time while growing up, and that person was viewed with as much curiosity in my hometown of Freeport, Texas as would have been a Martian with three heads arriving in our midst. My family also lived for a period in Algiers, Louisiana, across the river from New Orleans, and that was my first sustained exposure to those who practiced the Catholic faith, and our reaction was to view them as totally alien beings, almost as heathens. That this is unfair and patently untrue is beside the point--the point is that the South cannot be defined by such simple terms as predominant religions or accents or even a common “take” on things.However, New Orleans, where both Gilchrist and Stone set their stories, is a fairly isolated and definable community, unique in the South, and as so, is fairly easy to assign attributes to a fiction character that carry weight as to who that person is and where he fits into the mosaic of the culture--which piece of the tile provides his borders. Other Southern cities, such as Atlanta and Houston would be far less easy to study simply because of the mass infusion of Northerners into those communities which have homogenized the culture into something hybrid. Indeed, it is those very cities that inspired the epithet “The New South,” illustrating a new kind of culture not found in that form anywhere else. Perhaps the same sort of thing occurred in Detroit in the 1940’s after World War II, when a huge influx of Southerners, mostly black and poorer whites, immigrated to that city for employment in the auto factories, although I have yet to hear anyone apply the appellation “The New North” to that city, even though the experience was similar to the later exodus.“Teddy” therefore, suggests immediately a young boy of some wealth and proper family, i.e., long and distinguished lineage.In the last part of her opening sentence, we see that Teddy is asleep in his second-floor bedroom. This again, denotes he is a member of the ruling class. Poorer residences in New Orleans, unless they have been subdivided into apartments, are traditionally single story structures, usually of “shotgun” or “camel-back” architecture. That he also has his own bedroom is a luxury usually only those well-to-do can afford.As the first paragraph of the story develops, even though the author has not yet used a single word to physically describe Teddy, we have a complete picture of who he is by the description of his physical surroundings, especially if we understand the Southern culture. His bedroom has a private bath. For a child to have his own bathroom is assuredly an indicator of wealth. Then, there are mobiles from the Museum of Modern Art hanging from a ceiling fan above his bed. In the window is another mobile a visiting poet had given him. He has been tutored. All these are obvious signs of a privileged upbringing, even to someone unfamiliar with New Orleans culture.Gilchrist then uses two elements of place that may mean little to a reader unfamiliar with the New Orleans culture, but which carry a great significance to the initiated. The first is that Teddy’s mother came originally from Mandeville across Lake Ponchartrain. The city of Mandeville has a two-headed reputation, in that wealthy racehorse breeders abound there, as well as other families of wealth--lumber owners and other captains of industry, along with rich landowners, and...it is the home of the state mental institution. Mandeville thus serves as a metaphor for the personality of the mother, and indeed, we later find out that she is a woman of breeding but imbued with baser instincts. This is actually an accurate picture of what the Old South views of as the New Southern Woman, at least in the more rarefied classes, and, interestingly, this view derives from the influence the movie “Gone With The Wind” created both in Southerners and Yankees alike. The character of Scarlett O’Hara is perhaps the culprit in many of the more untrue stereotypes of Southerners, especially of women. Rarely, if ever, did such a woman exist, except in Margaret Mitchell’s imagination, and in fairness, the movie version wasn’t quite true to the character portrait Mitchell painted, but...That’s Hollyweird!Finally (in the first paragraph) we learn that Teddy is a student at the Newman School. The public schools in New Orleans are virtually 100 percent black; nearly all white citizens, regardless of economic status, send their children to private schools. In the parish of New Orleans itself, one would be hard-pressed to find a Caucasian child in most public schoolrooms. Whites comprise less than five percent of the public school population in that parish, more in the outlying parishes of Metairie and Kenner, but still not significant. But, there are private schools and then there are private schools. A great many exist solely to allow de facto segregation and even the poorest of families go to great lengths to provide private schooling for their children for that sole reason. However, there are certain schools, chief of which are Newman and Ecole, which are highly selective (read, no blacks allowed whatsoever, regardless of the economic strata) and which require exorbitant sums to attend. Newman stands alone at the very top of this elite list, with Ecole second. The requirements at Newman are race, wealth and family; at Ecole, only race and wealth are the determinants--they will enroll the noveau riche while Newman will not. If a New Orleanian hears that a family’s son is admitted to Newman the correct assumption would be that child to be wealthy, white and old money. These two schools, in particular, make no attempt at all to even allow a token child of color to be admitted to their hallowed corridors, indeed, just the opposite. Every effort is taken to prevent that from happening.Further evidence of Teddy’s class is given when we learn he attends services at Episcopal, a denomination not known for its large poverty-stricken congregations.In the second paragraph, we receive yet another clue to Teddy’s class. His stepfather Eric had let “the springer spaniels” into the house. If the characters peopling this story were of a different class, the dogs might perhaps have been nondescript mutts or hounds, but springer spaniels are an aristocratic breed of canine and their being in the house wouldn’t be worthy of note, especially since they don’t contribute to the story except to help define this family’s socio-economic status.The title itself lends import to who these people are. Stucco is not a material used in poorer construction. Baser structures are made of cheaper pine from the northeastern part of the state. Stucco is another indicator of wealth.Gilchrist really pounds us over the head with details that stake out Teddy’s elevated place in society. His older brothers are off for the summer at Camp Carolina, for instances. Lower classes don’t send their sons and daughters to ritzy summer camps, as a rule.A large part of the New Orleans culture is the free use of alcohol, perhaps more so here than in any other part of the country as a whole. The author introduces this element into the mosaic when she describes the July heat as being so oppressive that,“It pressed people’s brains against their skulls. Onlysugar and whiskey made people feel better.”Gilchrist is right; sugar is everywhere, as is booze, and it is what allows people to get up and operate in the heat. More important, this passage subtly refers to the peculiar kind of New Orleans madness others have noted and written about, such as in Tennessee Williams’ plays “The Glass Menagerie” and “A Streetcar Named Desire”.Now the trouble begins in the story. Eric wakes Teddy to go search for Teddy’s mother who has been gone all night. Eric drives down Nashville Street to Chestnut (shabby part of town) and then they come to a duplex where Eric knows her to be. This is a two-story building, but a duplex, signifying that it is a poorer residence, having been divided into two dwellings. Also, the names of the streets in this section are important, as streets in the Big Easy are how poorer neighborhoods are defined boundary-wise, avenues being where the wealthier reside.The naming of the streets is also important, as New Orleans is a checkerboard” town. Roughly every two blocks, the neighborhood changes. There will be two blocks of mostly poor blacks and whites, then two blocks of wealthier whites, sometimes, as on St. Charles Avenue and parts of the Uptown area, literal millionaires in a two block stretch and then two blocks of slum-like housing directly adjacent. The reason for this is that integration was forced on New Orleans in the 1960’s, and whereas northern cities had decades upon decades, even centuries, to “naturally” form their racially-defined neighborhoods, many southern cities like New Orleans didn’t have that luxury of time and with the passage of new housing laws, the town almost overnight developed in a checkerboard fashion, racially. There are several other dynamics at work here as well; for instance, New Orleans has a curious history of coexisting with black people, with their tradition of wealthy young white men once yearly selecting black mistresses whom they then set up in homes and treated as an unequal family, going so far as to educate their mutual offspring in colleges and universities and setting those children up in businesses. That meant a unique acceptance among the white population, especially the wealthy, of black people that was peculiar to the local culture. Even back to the slave-holding days, blacks were given quarters adjacent to the main house, where, many times, mistresses for the man of the manor were openly housed. These are still known as “slave quarters” and when integration came, many were sold off or rented as residences to blacks. That is a way for the locals even today to tell if the person they are talking to is a native or carpetbagger. When speaking of the old area in the Vieux Carre, natives refer to it as the “French Quarters, while an interloper will almost always call the area the “French Quarter”. Along St. Charles Avenue, for instance, there are mile after mile of incredible mansions, while a block behind them, on either side, exists some of the most execrable squalor imaginable. Unspoken laws exist today that prevent each race from trespassing on the other, even with their close proximity to one another. One ancient exception was the establishment of the “neutral ground”, the center medians in the middle of designated streets where blacks were allowed to set up stands for purposes of commerce in the midst of white neighborhoods and where blacks and whites could safely commingle.A little later on in the story, we learn the housekeeper Geneva (black name) will be along shortly and Eric tells Teddy to have her fix him some pancakes, which fixes their racial relationship, as even the children of white families have almost complete authority over black servants and employees. Gilchrist doesn’t have Eric “ask” Teddy for breakfast; he has the boy “tell” her.Further on, Eric sends Teddy to his grandparents’ house in Mandeville with Big George the gardener. Once again, place and setting help delineate the Southern relationships of the races. Big George takes Teddy to the Camellia Grill, a famous landmark just off St. Charles Avenue where the streetcar makes its turn onto Carollton Avenue. (I used to live a block away on Burthe) This is Tulane University area, where the nouveau riche attend (the truly rich go to LSU if they are patriotic, or out of state to Duke or Maryland or various Ivy League schools); Tulane has the reputation of being where captains of industry send their sons and daughters after they’ve partied their way out of several other schools, and while it is respectable, it has a slightly soiled patina for those of truly old money. Thus, it is “safe” to venture out in this neighborhood, even if it is a cut below better neighborhoods found uptown.Racially, the Camellia Grill qualifies as a place where young white boys of breeding may go with a trusted black employee. The clientele is a mix of tourists and locals, where locals are ordinarily seated on the left of the two counters and tourists and lower-level citizens on the right. In busy times it becomes more democratic, but occasionally an older dowager with a heightened sense of propriety will become incensed at finding herself being seated in the bustle at the wrong counter and adjustments will be made by the one-armed owner who seats himself by the cash register. Tourists are somewhat bewildered at times when they observe people turning down a spot at the right counter to await an opening on the left. The Camellia Grill represents a neutral zone, just as the neutral ground along some of the streets does.Before they go to the Camellia Grill, Teddy asks Eric if he can buy Big George lunch. He doesn’t ask George, but Eric, as this is the proper way to do this in this society. If Teddy and George were of equal class and/or race, George would, as the adult, purchase the lunch, but in this instance, that would be unthinkable. Again, Gilchrist doesn’t select the place they will eat in willy-nilly, but to again further define the characters against the backdrop of Southern custom.When Big George drives Teddy over the Ponchartrain bridge, he keeps the speedometer pegged at a steady sixty miles per hour. Seemingly innocent, the speed the author allows the black handyman to drive, but as in most other things peculiarly New Orleanian, this is another clue to his status. Ponchartrain bridge has its own police force, separate from New Orleans and Metairie on the one end and Covington on the other, a “Sheriff of Nottingham” fiefdom. While the legal speed is fifty-five except near the middle where the bridge rises to allow boats to pass on their way to the Gulf, white drivers routinely motor at speeds up to eighty with impunity while blacks are given a cushion of only about five miles per hour. The chief of this police force was a client in the salon I worked in and would often joke about this disparity and regular commuters across the bridge were fully aware of their limits. The only exception to this unwritten law were white drivers of cars that appeared suspicious, perhaps fitting the profile of a drug dealer or user or vehicles weaving erratically. Otherwise, race dictated how fast you could drive beyond the posted limit. This seems picayune (unless, of course, it affects you), but such things are important to many white people.It is certainly possible that the speed Gilchrist had Big George driving was entirely innocent, but considering the care with which she has inserted other elements into the story that carry racial and social weight, it is also entirely possible this is still another meaningful bit of information designed to place the characters within the context of their culture.Outsiders to the culture may laugh at such mores or think them nonexistent if they were not raised in the society and forced since birth to suffer or enjoy the consequences, but they exist and are part and parcel of every citizen’s life, unlikely to be ignored. Thirty-odd years of civil rights legislation has done much to change the outward appurtenances of the Old South, but underneath still rumble many of the old feelings and values, and survival, especially of blacks, depends heavily on knowledge of how the “system” works.A telling incident that happened to me and my wife Mary (who is from Indiana), occurred when she was newly arrived in New Orleans, shortly after we were married. One day, while passing an attractive girl, I made the offhand remark that she was “passing for white.” In the North, such a thought wouldn’t have even crossed my mind--I doubt I would have paid the girl the slightest attention insofar as race was concerned. But, back in the South, it became again almost a knee-jerk reflex to pick up on such a thing.“What do you mean?” Mary asked, not understanding what I was saying. I explained and she retorted, “You’re crazy! Why, that girl is whiter than I am!” She refused to believe me, not that it mattered in the least whether the girl was white or black or green. That wasn’t the point. The point was, in that society, someone with even a solitary drop of so-called “black blood” who would try to deny that blood was still considered in a negative way. A day later, this same girl happened to enter the salon my wife worked at, and a black stylist with whom she worked, whispered behind her hand to Mary that “That hussy is trying to pass.” Only then did my wife believe what I had said and still she herself couldn’t see any difference in the features of the girl from any other white girl. It’s just that both I, the white, and her co-worker, the black, had both been raised in a culture where even the tiniest clues are considered important to determine race and social class and these principles are still being adhered to even at this rather late date in our history.There was an ongoing cause celibre featured in the media about the same time, where a woman had put on an application for a state government job that she was of the white race. Someone had investigated and discovered that she was one sixteenth black. The state had denied employment, claiming she had falsified her application and the case went to the state supreme court, which held for the state, saying the woman was legally black. It didn’t matter that she was overwhelmingly of Caucasian heritage and race, in the tradition of the culture even the slightest trace of black ancestry renders one black. The finding held on appeal.The same kind of attitude pertains to social class, which in the South is more dependent on family and breeding than wealth. As a point of fact, wealth is more or less at the bottom of the deciding factors when determining whether to interact socially with others. A good example is the term “jeezum” which was popular among many teenaged girls in New Orleans a few years ago. If a visitor were to eavesdrop on dozens of teens while walking around the city, he would think the term to be a local saying most of the kids were using, something like “cool, man” or the like. In fact, however, it was only uttered by those raised in the Ninth Ward and Irish Channel, never by an Uptown girl. Use of this term would place the person class-wise instantly by a local observer. There are literally thousands of such clues that are absorbed almost subconsciously by the native and serve to place others according to their class, race, or station in society. Gilchrist seems especially attuned to many of these nuances, and while someone not privy by virtue of a lifelong training in picking them up would scarcely notice them or even be aware of them, a story like “The Stucco House” is teeming with them.Robert Stone, in his award-winning novel “A Hall of Mirrors” seems to have gone in another direction. The feeling this reader came away with after reading the story, also set in New Orleans, was that of a person (the author) who approaches his material from two perspectives. One, as a Southerner, but not one from New Orleans, and two, as a writer who experiences guilt over his heritage, in particular in respect to race relations.In “A Hall of Mirrors”, Stone showed me a side of New Orleans I’m fairly unfamiliar with--East New Orleans. When you live in New Orleans you are aware of two distinct and separate parts of the metropolis, New Orleans itself and the outlying communities or suburbs, including Metairie, Kenner, Vieux Carre, the CBD, Uptown, Downtown, Irish Channel, Ninth Ward, Bucktown, Lakefront and several other smaller areas. East New Orleans is an area unto itself, viewed as such by residents of both general areas. While it was fascinating to see a part of a world which on the one hand I’m very familiar and on the other completely ignorant, I sensed a false note in the novel, in that Stone has residents from East New Orleans routinely interacting with folks from the French Quarters and other parts of what is generally considered “true” New Orleans, while my own experience is that people from East New Orleans very rarely even visit New Orleans itself--perhaps for special occasions such as Mardi Gras or the Jazz and Heritage Festival, but certainly not on a day-to-day basis. That there are individuals that do so is undoubtedly true, but Stone presents intermingling of residents of the two areas as normal, which it is not.Folks from Kenner or Metairie (Metry) and other adjacent communities travel back and forth to New Orleans, especially to the CBD and Quarters and obvious standard tourist areas, as regular as constipation in octogenarians, but folks from East New Orleans? My impression is that Stone is probably a native Southerner but not a New Orleans native, and that he gathered background material for this novel from visits, not from growing up in either area. Perhaps he is even from Louisiana, but not from East New Orleans or New Orleans (and the aforementioned outlying areas).I suspect what Stone has done is what lots of others have done before him, in researching novels or films, and that is he interviewed doormen and cab drivers and bartenders to come up with his setting, and these are absolutely the last people in town a researcher should ever ask questions of.For instance, in probably most major cities, it would be valuable to query doormen and cab drivers as to the best places to eat or where the best entertainment can be found...but not in New Orleans. In New Orleans, cabbies and doormen and others who meet and greet the public are all part of a vast “steering” system, whereby whenever they direct a tourist or outsider to a certain establishment, they are comped a couple of bucks. It’s an interesting phenomenon I’ve only observed in New Orleans and am unaware of its being practiced to that extent anywhere else in the country.A good example of how this “underworld commerce” work is seen in the popular movie, “The Big Easy.” That film was so full of holes it should have been premiered in Wisconsin, the land of cheese, Swiss and other porous varieties. For instance, no principal actor had a correct New Orleans accent, and only Dennis Quaid’s mother had even a Louisiana accent. The only problem was, she used a Cajun accent, and Cajuns aren’t indigenous to New Orleans, but more from western and southern Louisiana, in the bayou country which the Cajuns settled upon immigrating from Nova Scotia. Granted, there are Cajuns in New Orleans, but there are Cajuns in Los Angeles as well, which doesn’t make their patois the native one there any more than it does in the Big Easy. There are seven identifiable accents attributed to New Orleans natives and none of them even resemble a Cajun one, but to an outsider who doesn’t recognize the differences in the various parts of the state, it might appear to be part of the native tongue. Cajuns who do immigrate to New Orleans strive valiantly to lose their accent usually, because the perception of those from the city that those who speak in Cajun dialects are “countrified” or rural bumpkins. The classic New Orleanian accent, found in the inner city more closely resembles a Brooklyn accent than any other, and is spoken by those who grew up in the Quarters and to a line bounded by Canal and Magazine. There’s also an Uptown accent (actually two accents, depending on what part of Uptown one is from), a Downtown accent, an Irish Channel accent, a Ninth Ward (very distinctive!) accent, a Bucktown accent...and so on. No Cajun accents. There’s also a point in the movie where Quaid is in the bullpen with a bunch of other cops and the female interest, Ellen Barkin, and he gets ready to leave and he says, “I’ll see you guys.” (Italics mine). Not on your life! Not in New Orleans or anywhere else in the South would a native say “you guys”. Especially when a woman was present. They would have fallen on the floor howling and hooting. He would properly have said “y’all” (and not that moronic “you-all” only seen in the worst of movies and books).In another scene, Quaid and Barkin go to Tipitina’s and he breaks through the waiting line to eat their food. Not something a native New Orleanian would consider. The only worse food in town is found at The Court of Two Sisters and a native wouldn’t risk being shot (very real possibility) jumping a line anywhere, much less gag down the swill served at Tipitina’s under any circumstances. The only people who go to either place are those steered there by doormen and cab drivers who then are comped a couple of bucks for their “tip” to the unsuspecting tourist.The reason I mention this movie is that I suspect Stone gathered much of his material in the same way the associate producer who scouted locations for “The Big Easy” probably did, by hanging out in bars and restaurants and schmoozing with doormen for “inside” information. Not realizing no self-respecting doorman or cabbie would ever give away information about the truly good places to go--most natives of New Orleans want to make sure tourists don’t find out the good places and ruin them as they have the Quarters.Another clue (to this reader) that Stone isn’t a native of New Orleans is that he refers to the Vieux Carre as “the Quarter” and this is always a red flag to the native who always refers to the old section in the plural. Only Armani-clad national news broadcasters and folks from Ames, Iowa call it the “Quarter”, and it causes many a native to grind his teeth upon hearing the area referred to in that manner.The second point observed in Stone’s novel, was in how he drew his villains. His technique smelled of John Grisham’s own inimitable style of painting his bad guys (other than the out-and-out thugs) as fat-cat Republican lawyers. Francois Camoin, in a lecture at Vermont College once stated jokingly that he was “Church-burned”, and I suspect that Stone, like Grisham and a lot of other “New Southerners” is “conservative-burned” and this colors their take on the culture. Stone’s racism is more than a little stereotyped, and if he were a Northerner perhaps this could be excused, but as I expect him to be a Southerner himself, I find inexcusable. I personally think that to create truly memorable villains, they must be endowed with the same heroic qualities as the hero, and Stone fails to do that. His villains have power, but that is not the same as heroism, and for me that is the failing of the book. All his racist folks are made to appear totally stupid, ignorant or blind, and while in no way would I ever condone racism, in a literary sense characters that are all cut from the same bolt of cloth come across as wooden caricatures that are, in the end, unbelievable, or, at the very least (and especially condemning) uninteresting. The fact of the matter is, there do exist racists that are intelligent; it gets an easy laugh to utter that’s not an example of an oxymoron, especially when preaching to the choir, but it doesn’t advance truth much either. Fighting a lie with a lie results in nothing but yet another lie, and that is the danger in this kind of writing.When civil rights legislation was imposed on the South in the sixties, a new generation was exposed to a litany that derided the old culture and caused young minds to feel tremendous guilt at what their forefathers had supposedly created; it is into this atmosphere I feel Stone’s values emerged and the result is the kind of characters he created in the novel.That this appeals to the non-Southern critic is understandable; it endorses what they already believe to be true and the fact that it emanates from a “Southerner” makes it just that much more “factual”, and the judges of such awards as the Faulkner Award, most likely being Southerners themselves, are, I suspect, cast from the same mold as Stone himself, and his work assuages their own feelings of guilt. Prestigious awards and laudatory plaudits aside, the promotion of yet more stereotypes does more harm than good in arriving at any truth, even though this is assuredly an extremely unpopular position to take in these days of the holy P.C.If William Faulkner were to select the winner of the award that bears his name, I truly believe he would have chosen the work of someone like Gilchrist rather than Stone, with whom I feel he would have found exception to, not in his writing ability, which is considerable, but in his portrayal of the truth. Faulkner himself wavered little from exposing truth, even when it was painful, whereas Stone confronts the enemy obliquely, if not unfairly, much as a bully would."},
{"title": "DETAIL AND DESCRIPTION", "date": "Wednesday, March 17, 2010", "text": "©Leslie H. EdgertonAs writers, let’s take a look at Detail and Description, kind of the glue that holds stories together and has a lot to do with making it come alive for the reader. These are a couple of the elements in which we can really get creative, and for me, is one of the fun parts of writing.Detail and description are many times not taught in classes as a separate subject, other than the teacher comments on “good” description and detail when she sees it. This, I think, is an oversight. Improper use of these elements can make an otherwise good story come across as boring, the worst sin a writer can make. Above all else, a story should be entertaining. Otherwise, why read it? Unless the reader’s goal is instruction and for that we can always turn to nonfiction.The first rule in creating word pictures that come alive for the reader is to avoid clichés and hackneyed phrases. These are the STD’s of creative writing and will lead to a bad end (dull story). Such (non)descriptive phrases like “black as the night”, “Pure as the driven snow”, “blazing eyes”, and the like are invisible to the reader. They’ve been used so much, they are no longer seen by the reader’s eye. Look for fresh, imaginative ways to describe; look for the small but telling detail. Chekhov admonished writers to make description “very brief and relevant...one ought to seize upon the little particulars, grouping them in such a way that, in reading, when you shut your eyes, you get a picture.” Chekhov felt it a sin to overdescribe (I agree!), that the good writer gives just enough detail to evoke the reader’s knowledge of life. This is why fresh description is so important. There should be little of it but what there is should be newly-created. Chekhov also had another interesting opinion. That the writer should write a beginning, a middle, and an end...and then cut the beginning and end because what’s left is the story. Very often, this is a good way to look at your stories. Helps get rid of those insidious backstories and setups beginning writers seem to favor...Speaking of spareness in description, an interesting fact is that Hemingway’s entire vocabulary in the whole of his published writing involved only 8,000 words. And yet, what superior writing! Look at this brief description from The Sun Also Rises for an example of description that works well:“The coffin was loaded into the baggage car of the train, and the widow and the two children rode, sitting, all three together, in an open third-class railway-carriage. The train started with a jerk, and then ran smoothly, going down grade around the edge of the plateau and out into the fields of grain that blew in the wind on the plain on the way to Tafalla.”Don’t we get a complete physical picture of where these people are? There is no flowery, purple prose involved; the words used to depict the scene are spare, plain...and they work!When description doesn’t work, or falls flat, it is usually because of the overuse of weak adverbs and adjectives. Voltaire observed that the adjective is the enemy of the noun and the adverb is the enemy of the verb. John Gardner said, “Adverbs are either the dullest tools or the sharpest tools in the novelist’s toolbox.”Adjectives may seem to strengthen nouns when in fact they usually weaken them. Adverbs are not designed to augment a verb--as in walked slowly--but to create friction with the verb or change its meaning. For an exercise (not an assignment - just something to illustrate for yourself how this works), pair the following adverbs with different verbs to see how they change those verbs: conscientiously, uncharacteristically, reluctantly, furtively, and relentlessly.All of this is not meant to say to not use adverbs and adjectives. Used thoughtfully, these sentence components can sharpen and illuminate prose, as in the following examples: She had been to Germany, Italy, everywhere that one visits acquisitvely.     Elizabeth Bowen, The Last September She jammed the pedal to the floor, and like something huge and pre-historic and pea-brained, the Jeep leapt stupidly out of its stall.     Sharon Sheehe Stark, A Wrestling Season So closely had we become tied to the river that we could sense where it lay and make for it instinctively like cattle.     W.D. Wetherell, Chekhov’s Sister When Sula first visited the Wright house, Helene’s curdled scorn turned to butter.     Toni Morrison, Sula With a bladdery whack it (the boat) slapped apart and sprang away.     Sharon Sheehe Stark, A Wrestling Season Hank was not accepted at Harvard Law School; but goodhearted Yale took him.     John Updike, “The Other” On the far side of the room, under the moiling dogs the twins areplaying.     Francois Camoin, “Baby, Baby, Baby”In contemporary fiction, description has become active and this is one of the features that separate it from more archaic writing. This is one of my personal criticisms of some high school English teachers, that they teach archaic styles of writing description. (My apologies to H.S. English teachers, of which there are many good ones...somewhere...) There is a logical reason for this. Many times, they are teaching the so-called “classics” and holding them up to be models. While it is instructive to read the “masters”, they should be read in context; that is, within their time period. Oftentimes, they are not, alas, but are held up as examples of how to write well. Let me give you an example.Let’s say there was a woman living in Ames, Iowa a hundred years ago. She took a summer vacation in Australia and when she returned she wrote a novel based on her experiences there. In describing a kangaroo, she used six paragraphs to describe the animal, utilizing many clever similes and adjectives to do so. It was a wonderful work of art (for the time) but today’s writer would simply say the word “kangaroo” to describe the animal. I mean, we’ve all seen a kangaroo at this stage of our history, if not live in a zoo, at least on television or in a movie. There is no need to go into this much description in today’s world of information. But the teacher who used this model improperly would point out the author’s use of descriptive static language and the student who best emulated it would receive the better grade. Thus rewarded, he or she would go on to fill her pages with purple, flowery descriptive prose which is no longer in vogue. And probably end up teaching English herself and...She (this imaginary student) would then write, say, a beach scene, using all kinds of flowery description to draw for the reader a mental picture of the waves and sand, when today’s writer would take that same description and make it shorter and more succinct and combine action with it. As in, “As he raced off the access road onto Bryan Beach, moonlight glinted off a piece of broken glass.” (Italics mine) This creates the entire visual scene of a beach in just a few short words.That is the fault of Melville’s Moby Dick. For the first third of the novel, we are “treated” to reading everything we never wanted to know about a whale. That was fine for Melville’s time; readers didn’t have access to the Discovery Channel and didn’t know much about whales. Today, we all have a fairly good idea of what whales look like and even much about their lives and habits and the first thing an editor today would cut would be the first third of Mobey Dick.Details are what makes a story become real for the reader. Details are what (effective) liars use to make their story believable. That reminds me. In my home, on a sign above my desk, I’ve posted an old Welsh saying that says, “Tell a story, tell a lie, or get out.” That’s all we are as storytellers--liars! Of course, in a non-pejorative way! Probably... Well, sometimes...We use details to bring abstract ideas to life. It is not enough to talk of bigotry or wealth or a person’s “goodness”, we must bring these concepts to life in a concrete way with the use of descriptive sensory details, similes, and metaphors. For example, we have probably all been treated to a parent’s admonishment to “...eat all your vegetables--there are millions starving in Biafra who would love to have what you’re wasting.” This carries none of the weight it would if the parent say: “Eat all your vegetables. Mrs. Miller next door has been out of work for six months and last night I saw her going through our garbage can. She'd love to have what you're wasting.\"  The parenting unit in this instance has rendered the abstract to the particular and it drives the lesson home. The same is true in writing. Don’t say your character is a liar; gives us a scene in which he lies. Don’t write that your character is poor; show us a scene in which he checks parking meters for change. Don’t state that your character is elderly; show her having trouble climbing a stairs. Use the kinds of details that show us that. The stairs were pitched steeply; they seemed endless, reaching to the sky; they were slippery with floor polish; the handrail was broken, etc. Reduce the vague to a small particular and then it comes alive and rings true.Go back through your stories and try and find places where better use of detail and description will make the writing stronger and more believable.Exercise Sensory Power.The written word shouldn't just be read. It should be felt, tasted, smelled, heard, and seen. It should be experienced.A lot of the time, as writers, we have movies playing in our heads. Characters talk and move; scenery whizzes by; secrets are whispered; bad guys die; heroes triumph. We see the stories in our minds and we write the words on the page. One problem that can occur, though, is that we write what we \"see,\" and we forget that there is a lot in our story to tell with the other senses, like smells, tastes, the feel of things, and sounds.I bet if you went back through your manuscript or story and marked all the sensory words, you'd find that the vast majority of them are descriptions of the way things or  people look. Not too many would be about the way something tasted, or the texture of an object, or the smell, whether it's rancid or flowery, or the everyday sounds.You don't want your readers to just drift through your book, seeing the movie in your head. A film, even a scratch-and-sniff 3-D concoction, is inferior to a book in the ability of the author and reader to explore the senses. With a book, you have the opportunity to pull the reader in, not only with the sense of sight, but with all the other senses. Make use of that opportunity and your plot will be richer.Instead of telling the reader that Mary is angry, show us her anger. Let us hear the door slam and the glass shatter. Let us feel the bits of glass etching her palm as she  reaches for the door handle. Let us hear the glass crunching under her shoes as she paces, smell and taste the bitter coffee she sips.When you are describing that Florida coastline, palm trees swaying, consider letting your readers feel the grit of the sand, taste the brine, smell the car exhaust, hear the pounding surf.I'm not saying that every time you describe something, you have to include all five senses. But, certainly, try to throw in more than just what can be seen. Yes, this harkens back to the old saying of Show, Don't Tell, but it's more than that. I'm saying, yes, Don't Tell, but also Don't Just Show. At least not in the sense of letting the reader \"see\" everything. There's more to life than what we can see.You can write about a small girl in an orchard, picking a fresh peach. You can describe the trees, what the girl is wearing, the color of the fruit. Now, close your eyes and go beyond sight. How does the peach feel in her hands? How does it smell? Is the sun hot? The tree shade cool? How does the peach taste? Does it drip down her chin? Is it sticky? How does the wind sound as it ripples through the leaves? Is it loud? Whispering? Does it tickle her skin?One way to check whether you have Exercised Sensory Power is to take a hard copy of your story or novel and mark it up. Highlight sensory words. Use a different color marker for each of the five senses. My guess is that your work  will be primarily the color you chose for sight.Count your descriptions of each of the five senses. If you're especially weak in one of the senses, go back and find areas or scenes where you could edit. You don't have to go overboard. A little added here and there will greatly enhance your writing, and the reader's experience of your words.Transport your readers into another world, then make that world real to them by triggering all of their senses. If you use all five senses, chances are you'll also hook your readers emotionally. And once you do that, they'll want more.Blue skies,Les"},

Back in my cell, I read:Home is the place where, when you want to go there, they have to take you in.When I made parole, I called my mom to tell her my good news.I found out that my dad had never read Robert Frost.At least not that poem.This was sent to me by fellow writer, Carl Brush, who spotted it after reading my post on the upcoming TV series \"Justified\" based on the Elmore Leonard character.The original article can be found on SFGate.com here:http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/c/a/2010/03/15/DD3I1CF9S1.DTL---------------------------------------------------------------------Monday, March 15, 2010 (SF Chronicle)'Justified' scores with hot star, smart scriptsTim GoodmanJustified: Drama. 10 p.m. Tuesdays on FX.Timothy Olyphant's acting in \"Justified\" is so great that it strips away the notion that maybe he's so damn likable because of his all-too-short stint on HBO's classic Western series \"Deadwood.\" As Seth Bullock, the sheriff in Deadwood, Olyphant's steely gaze, Zen interior and matinee looks called to mind a younger Clint Eastwood. That \"Deadwood\" was one of television's best series at the time - then ended abruptly at the end of three seasons - made a lot of people hungry to see him in something like that again.In the second season of FX's \"Damages,\" he was also a gun-toting killer, but more of the unstable variety. But now he's back as the lead in the cable channel's latest drama, \"Justified,\" as Deputy U.S. Marshal Raylan Givens, born in eastern Kentucky and working in Miami wearing a Stetsonand cowboy boots.Givens is based on the character created by Elmore Leonard, who serves as executive producer on \"Justified.\" All you need is one look at Olyphant dressed for the role to know creator Graham Yost (\"The Pacific,\" \"Boomtown,\" \"Band of Brothers\") got the ideal actor. And it didn't take FX long to start an ad campaign that makes Olyphant look downright iconic. The best news of all is that Olyphant backs it up with an incredibly riveting performance. Better yet, \"Justified\" as a whole really delivers, from the explosive pilot to a couple of other, less adrenaline-filled but no less superb episodes that add humor and nuanced storytelling to the mix.Getting the genius of Leonard just right has been a difficult thing for the big and small screen. (Italics mine--he's saying the same thing I did.) But in \"Justified,\" the elements are in place for an exceptional television series. Raylan Givens left Kentucky to be a marshal at age 19. He's deadly accurate with a gun but, later in his career, became a bit too enamored with the old-school marshal mantra of \"You've got 24 hours to leave town or the next time I see you, I shoot you on sight.\" He puts that into effect in Miami and, as a disciplinary measure, gets sent to - you guessed it - Kentucky.Back home, he's got all kinds of ghosts to deal with. But his boss, Chief Deputy Art Mullen (Nick Searcy), is an old friend from the marshals. In Lexington, he teams up with Deputy Marshal Tim Gutterson (Jacob Pitts), a sniper in the Rangers while stationed in Afghanistan, and Rachel Brooks(Erica Tazel), who is small, fierce and no-nonsense.As the episodes unroll, we start to learn slightly more about the latter two. No doubt Yost will let \"Justified\" breathe a little bit - and the Givens character really fills up a scene - and flesh out those characters even more. Almost immediately, Searcy gives gravitas to Mullen, who is happy but leery that Givens has fallen in his lap.Those who have seen a trailer for this series have had their pulse jump at the thought of Olyphant squaring off with \"Shield\" alum Walton Goggins, who plays Givens' childhood friend from Kentucky, Boyd Crowder. The U.S. attorney wants Crowder for bank robbery charges (among the many other things he's done), and it's clear he and Givens are on an inescapable path that should meet like two trains on the same track.But for all the firepower in the pilot - Crowder has a rocket launcher that he's not afraid to use - \"Justified\" settles down to tell other, slightly less incendiary stories that weave in the familiar Leonard-style humor. Although it may be hard to top what amounts to an instant-classic line Givens delivers to Crowder - \"You make me pull, I'll put you down\" - \"Justified\" does just fine with humor. \"Outlaw life's hard, ain't it?\" Givens says, after smashing the butt of a rifle into a neo-Nazi.In the fourth episode, guest star Alan Ruck is wonderful as a fugitive wanted by the marshals and also by a drug cartel, who gets into a jam at the Mexican border. \"Looks like we've got a sniper on the Mexican side,\" Givens yells out as Ruck's character is pinned down. The response: \"Well, that's not going to help tourism.\"But the overriding thought watching \"Justified\" is that FX has just created an intriguing American hero. Olyphant's iconic look and portrayal of Raylan Givens recalls every badass good guy in Western lore, and you find yourself liking him more every time he pulls the trigger. That alone would be enough to make \"Justified\" appointment television, but it's clear there's a lot more depth yet to be mined as Yost and his writers (who had bracelets made that say WWED - \"What would Elmore do?\") reinvent the modern-day lawman.E-mail Tim Goodman at tgoodman@sfchronicle.com.

{"title": "New TV series, JUSTIFIED. Check it out!", "date": "Friday, March 12, 2010", "text": "A couple of months ago, I saw a promo on TV for a new series that immediately made me sit up and take notice. It was a quick 30-second commercial, but instantly, I turned to my wife Mary and said, “That looks like an Elmore Leonard story.” I couldn’t remember the name of the show at the time but began watching for it to appear again. When it did, I saw this time that, indeed, it was a show based on an Elmore Leonard character. I’d grasped that immediately in the first frames of the promo. It just “looked” like a Leonard story and character.I became genuinely excited. I’m a huge Elmore Leonard fan and had sworn off ever going to see any more of his work in a movie after what they did to his work in “Get Shorty.” I should have realized how bad they were going to mess that up when I saw John Travolta was going to star in it. Travolta should never even get near the set on a Leonard movie. Leonard has never written a character Travolta should play. Present-day Hollywood doesn’t “get” Leonard. He writes dark, dark, dark comedy, bordering on noir. My guess was that the Harvard MBAs in charge of “Get Shorty” didn’t grasp Leonard’s unique stories as his intelligence was above their paygrade. I thought perhaps it was just me and was gratified to read an interview with him about a year ago when he said pretty much the same thing and vowed never to let Hollywood ruin one of his novels ever again.Then, they announced they were making a movie based on my favorite of Leonard’s books, Killshot, and I groaned. This book is a work of genius and they’ll probably get Travolta or Danny DeVito to screw it up…And then… I saw this promo! Instantly, I knew this was a Leonard character. Just the “look” of the characters, the “action” of the brief scene, told me instantly this was something only Leonard could write. And it was. I knew it from the “feel” of the first frame of the promo. Now, I just hope it delivers. I have a feeling it will.The series is called “Justified” and begins on FX at 10:00 pm EST on March 16, 2010. It’s based on one of his best characters, U.S. Marshal Raylan Givens. The only thing that makes me wary is that I’ve since learned that most of the series is shot in California. One of the settings that’s crucial to the atmosphere of Raylan’s story is the state of Kentucky. I’m not sure how they can create that in La-La Land or how they’re going to make it look like Kentucky, but I’ll try to suspend my disbelief in that.I can’t wait!(For a great article on the show and a video of Elmore giving an interview, go to: http://www.fxnetworks.com/shows/originals/justified/elmoreleonard.php"},
{"title": "The Graveyard Shift guest column", "date": "Tuesday, March 9, 2010", "text": "The Graveyard Shift - Lee LoflandThere are no perfect crimes, merely imperfect investigationsGUEST COLUMN Les Edgerton: Accuracy In Crime Novels About Les: Les Edgerton served a little over 2 years in Pendleton in the sixties on a 2-5 burglary charge (plea-bargained down from 82 counts of second-degree burglary, a count of armed robbery, a count of strong-armed robbery, and a count of possession with intent to sell). When he was in the joint, then-President Johnson declared Pendleton to be “the single worst prison in the U.S.” Les agrees with that assessment…Since then, Les has earned a B.A. (With Honors of Distinction) from Indiana University and an MFA in Writing from Vermont College. He has published 9 books, taught creative writing at various universities, including the UCLA Writer’s Program, St. Francis University, and served as Writer-in-Residence at the University of Toledo and at Trine University. His work has been nominated for the Pushcart Prize, O. Henry Award, Edgar Allan Poe Award (short story category), PEN/Faulkner Award, Jesse Jones Book Award, Violet Crown Book Award (was awarded a Special Citation for his novel The Death of Tarpons), and others. A screenplay of his was a semifinalist in the Nichol’s Foundation Awards. The NY Times review of his story collection, Monday’s Meal, compared him favorably to Raymond Carver.Currently, he resides in Ft. Wayne, IN with his wife Mary and their son Mike. Les has two daughters-Britney and Sienna-from a previous marriage. He teaches online classes for Writer’s Digest and provides novel coaching services for writers.Les says, “When President Johnson came on TV to announce the results of his administration’s study that “Pendleton was the single-worst prison,” I was watching over in J Block and everyone stood up and began cheering and waving aloft a single digit. It was like our football team had just been named Number One. Quite a stirring experience. We knew then how Notre Dame fans felt…ACCURACY IN CRIME NOVELS(Depicting the criminal’s mind and behavior accurately)I’d like to address a subject that’s bothered me for many years. I’m speaking of the way authors have routinely depicted the average criminal’s mind and behavior, which, in the main, have been largely inaccurate.First, to establish my “bona fides” I am both a writer and an ex-con, having served about two years of a two-to-five sentence in the Indiana state prison at Pendleton, Indiana (for second-degree burglary) back in the sixties. I was originally charged with 82 burglaries, one count of armed robbery, one count of strong-arm robbery, and one count of possession with intent to deal. All of the charges were reduced to a single count of second-degree burglary via a plea bargain. I actually committed far more felonies-for instance, I did over 400 burglaries-but 82 was all my rap-partners could remember (or were in on-many I did solo) to roll over on me on-and so that’s the number I was charged with. The statue of limitations has run out on them now, so I can “fess up.”One of the basic elements of good writing, in my opinion, is veracity. Not only should the author remain true to his personal version of truth, but his reportage should also be accurate. And, in the case of the criminal mindset and normal behavior, I see instance after instance in short stories, novels and movies where an inaccurate portrayal is the rule and not the exception.Let’s look at three of the most common inaccuracies:1. Inmates in prison hate child molesters.Mostly hooey. It seems to be common wisdom these days that people on the bricks (”straights”) believe that inmates in prison hate child molesters and can’t wait to kill them. I disagree… to a point. Back in my time in prison (mid-sixties in a state joint, which is vastly different than a federal prison), nobody much cared about what you were in for. Actually, there weren’t many child molesters back then-child molestations, while they’ve always been around are infinitely more common these days than back then-but as long as they minded their business no one really bothered them or cared what they’d done. I can only remember knowing of one inmate who was a convicted child molester and nobody bothered him or much cared what he was in for. To be honest, a large number of people incarcerated have drinking or drug problems and when they’re on the sauce or high, pretty routinely abuse their own kids.2. Inmates hate convicted cops.Again, hooey. The few cops that were in the joint with me had more friends than anyone else, on average. The thing is, cops and outlaws interact with each other all the time on the bricks-at least the professional criminals do-and most of us like and even respect each other. There’s a very fine line between being a cop and a criminal, in my opinion. We’re both adrenaline junkies and is one of the chief reasons we become what we are in these two “career fields.” When I was “in the life” I used to hang out almost every night at a slop shop in downtown South Bend, before I went to “work,” and half the people there were off-duty cops and half were outlaws. We all got along well and if one of those guys got sent up, we were still friends.3. Inmates claim to be innocent.This is probably the biggest myth of all. Nobody claims to be innocent in the joint-even those few who are. If you were innocent and said so to other inmates, they would take that as a sign of weakness and you’d be in trouble. Where that comes from is when a reporter or researcher interviews an inmate, very often they’ll sing him a sad tale of woe about being bumrapped. The reason is, no matter how guilty the person is, once you’re inside, all hope has vanished. To be interviewed, especially by a sympathetic listener, the hope rises that enough bleeding hearts will read the article or see the show and be moved to do something to get the guy liberated. That it doesn’t happen doesn’t destroy the hope-they know it’s a long shot anything like that will happen, but it’s a glimmer of a hope and so they bring their acting chops to the table-probably even claim to have one of those b.s. “jailhouse conversions” and hope somehow their “story” (and that’s usually what it is-a story-will affect the right people’s hearts and a miracle will happen. I only knew one person when I was in who was truly innocent and there’s no way he would have claimed that to other inmates unless he really trusted they wouldn’t tell anyone else. That’d be suicide. In fact, when those who appear in documentaries and TV shows claim their innocence, the instant they’re back in the cellhouse they make sure to let everyone know they were just pulling a shuck.Another thing they don’t publicize as it would destroy the common misconception. Of all those people who get freed from prison after an investigation or new trial, probably 90-some percent aren’t freed because they were found innocent. They’re freed because of a legal technicality. You can look that up.For points #1 and #2, what I suspect has happened to lead to the hatred for child molesters and cops inside the walls is what has happened in just about all the instances of misconceptions about convicts. I think what’s happened is that movies romanticized this (inmates hating and killing child molesters) and inmates bought into this image of themselves for a variety of reasons–a typical reason being that people in prison are just plain looking for any kind of excuse to shank someone and this is as good a reason as any and even kind of makes the guy shanking a child molester look like a good or moral guy.This is exactly what happened with Mario Puzo and his book and subsequent movie “The Godfather.” Puzo admitted he knew nothing at all about the Mafia and made up nearly everything about them that’s in his book. This guy was living in a suburb in Connecticut-sitting in his garage typing on a door laid out over two sawhorses-and had never even seen a mafiosa up close. What he was familiar with were insurance executives and stock brokers. Just about everything in the book was fabricated out of whole cloth.The truth being, most Mafioso aren’t all that bright and are basically street thugs with fairly low I.Q.’s in general, but the movie glamorized and romanticized them with horse’s heads and “sleeping with the fishes” and “hitting the mattresses” and all the other stuff Puzo made up, so they just adopted the whole thing because it made them look much cooler than they actually were and are. Life imitated art. There’s just an awful lot of that going on in the public’s general perception of inmates and prisons.The same thing happened with the cops being in danger in the joint myth. Some individual somewhere told a reporter that and the naive reporter (there’s a lot of those folks!) reported it as gospel and just like the child molester myth, that just gave cons an excuse to shank someone and feel “moral.” Now, of course, thanks to television and the movies, convicted cops are in danger.The problem is, the vast majority of inmates in state prisons are operating with an average fourth-grade education and so aren’t likely to write screenplays or books (most can barely read), so the public only knows what a reporter or researcher tells them and inmates are almost never straight with them for all the above reasons and more. Ex-cons from federal joints are better-educated and sometimes do write articles and books, but the problem is federal joints are as different from state joints as a rowboat is from the Queen Mary. The next time I do a crime I’m going to do something that qualifies for a federal jolt first and then if I’m busted for something I’d do state time for, I’ll cop a plea on the federal beef and end up going there first, which means I’ll probably die in a federal prison before I do the state bit. Federal time is just a wee bit easier to do…If you’ll have me back, Lee, I’ll tell the story of the period Charles Manson and his cellmate in Corcoran, Roger Smith (who bills himself as the “Most-Stabbed Inmate in History”-which he probably is-he’s been shanked over 300 times) kept calling me for a month to chat and with Roger begging me to write his autobiography and what happened then.Thanks for having me!Blue skies,Les P.S. Of the thousands of novels and movies I’ve experienced, the only time I’ve seen the criminal mind portrayed accurately (imo) was in the scene in Pulp Fiction where the guy shoots his best friend in the back seat of the car by accident. His reaction is the only honest depiction of the criminal mind I’ve yet seen.

Posted in Guest columns | 7 Comments »Dear Les,HungryPeople would like to thank YOU for agreeing to this interview.  HungryPeople loves to provide exciting and thought-provoking insights on the art of living and working from people (from all walks of life).Check out the site at http://hungrypeople.posterous.com to learn more about why we mean by thought-provoking.Let's eat...1. What do YOU do for a living?Ans. Write books, teach writing online for Writer's Digest, and coach writers privately on their novels.2. What's the best thing about being a writer?Ans. Don't have to wear a tie or have business cards. Can write in the nude. All the groupie chicks. (I lied about the last one. I wish!)3. How does one find their inner voice?Ans. Drink lots of Jack Daniels. Only mix with water and/or ice and never pop unless you want to be considered a kid or a punk. Seriously, just write as if you're relating a story to your best friend who knows the same things you do. You'll use that \"shorthand\" voice you do in such a case and therefore end up with writing that trusts the reader's intelligence. Get rid of your thesaurus—there is no such thing as a synonym anyway. There's just the perfect word. The perfect word doesn't come in groups.4. What's key to being a great writer?Ans. Be willing to go deep inside you to that place everyone tries to hide from others and be willing to expose it, warts and all. Tell the truth.5. YOU had an amazing life, tell us what YOU learned while serving time in jail? While being a homeless man?In prison, I learned to always find something you can use as a weapon when entering a room. An ashtray, a beer bottle, a fountain pen.  Always try to keep your back to a wall. Don't believe or trust anyone. While homeless, the biggest lesson I learned was to try not to go hungry. It's not always easy to accomplish that, especially when you don't have access to food. The Salvation Army has the best meals on holidays, except for the one in Baltimore. It's okay but I'd hesitate to give it four stars. New Orleans has the best food in shelters. Shelter food there is better than the best restaurants in Indiana. California is maybe the worst. They don't believe in meat in California—they're all ruminants and eat lots of grass dishes. At least, I think it's grass. (And not the good kind that you use in brownies.)6. If YOU were Secretary of the Interior, what would YOU change in how we manage our prisons? What would be the top 3 things YOU would be remembered for after YOUR term?Ans. This is easy! Except, I have more than three. 1.Provide real rehabilitation that leads to a real and good-paying job, not being a dishwasher or fry cook. There is virtually no rehabilitation these days and it's a big reason why people come back more than they ever have. 2. Get rid of those prisons as businesses located in other states. An inmate from Connecticut, sitting in a prison in Texas has lost his entire support system. Not to mention, many of them just warehouse prisoners and let them vegetate in a cell 23 hours a day. 3. Educate the politicians and media who have created all kinds of problems by scaring people about criminals unrealistically and without factual basis for their claims. Be aware that no matter where the institution is, doing time is never easy for anyone. \"Lock 'em up and throw away the key\" is a moronic concept. I guess that's why politicians and the media use it so much—they're infinitely qualified to espouse on moronic ideas. 4. Spend more money on good mental institutions and separate the folks with mental problems from bona fide criminals. I'd guess that at least 60% (and probably more) of those incarcerated aren't really criminals in the traditional sense, but are mentally ill. The state just feels it's cheaper to warehouse them in prisons than provide mental health care. 5. Develop decent libraries. If funds are an issue, take the money spent on teaching them to get a G.E.D. and spend it on more books. People will (truly) educate themselves if they have sufficient books available. Getting a G.E.D. \"looks\" like an education, but it's b.s. 6. Make prisons safe for inmates. Being sent to an environment where chances are excellent you'll be assaulted or raped constitutes cruel and unusual punishment in every way and is unconstitutional. 7. Get wardens/superintendents out of the food business. Most are given a monthly budget for inmate meals and if they come under, they get to keep the rest. I don't think any of them use even close to the budgeted amount. 8. Police inmates working in the dentist's and doctor's offices better. In case you don't know it, they're stealing the Novocain and other drugs and watering them down. It's why nobody wants to go to the dentist—who wants your tooth pulled when your gums have been deadened with saline? 9. Get women out of male institutions, at least in population. That's the nuttiest idea so-called \"progressives\" ever came up with. Just makes doing time a thousand times harder. Give those women jobs holding the flag at construction sites. (Am I being a male chauvinist hog? Sorry!) 10. If you're going to \"lock 'em up and throw away the key\" at least provide a bed for each inmate.7. Tell us more about the story of YOUR favorite quote: Never let anyone rent space in your head.Ans. My son Mike and I saw an episode of \"Candid Camera\" where the setup was a shop in a mall where a sign was placed by the register that read: \"No change given back today.\" As various people came up with their purchases, there are a variety of reactions. Some argued, some got mad, some withdrew their purchases. One guy came up, handed over a bill and was due 99 cents in change. The clerk pointed to the sign and told him, \"Sorry, we're not giving change back today.\" He smiled, shrugged, and walked out with his purchase. The interviewer caught up with him and asked why he didn't react differently. \"Because,\" he answered, \"I never let anyone rent space in my head.\" Mike and I thought it was a perfect life philosophy. This is a guy in charge of himself!8. What's YOUR favorite book?Ans. The Stranger by Albert Camus. A close second would be anything by James Lee Burke (today's Faulkner), Harry Crews, Lee Child, Christopher Moore, Elmore Leonard (his Killshot would be my second-favorite book), early David Sedaris, Dennis Lehane, Robert Crais... oh, you just wanted one... my bad!9. Who are YOUR personal heroes?Ans. Thomas Jefferson, my wife Mary, Paul Newman, and the person who invented tennis shoes.10. What are YOU hungry for?Ans. I assume you mean food? My top three are Oysters Rockefeller, crawfish etoufe and crawfish bisque. None of which are available in Indiana, alas! At least not done well.11. What's the best job in the world?Ans. Being a stunt man in porno movies. Great pay, low hours, they never show your face, good union, big cheesy award ceremony once a year, kind of like the Academy Awards with sexier people... The only drawback is you have to like large animals. Seriously, I have the best job in the world. Nothing can possibly be better than being a writer. There's all those groupies, you know...1. Please include a short description about YOU including your own blog or businesses or advocacies.I'm an incredibly rich, handsome man with a beautiful wife and three children. I live in paradise (Fort Hooterville Wayne, Indiana). All of my nine books are huge bestsellers and everybody wants me on their TV show and to give interviews for the NY Times. I'm 66, but I look about 30. I can bench press 6,000 pounds and am probably the best lover ever. I'm also a fiction writer, as perhaps you can tell by the above. The key to good fiction is to include about 2% of the truth and people will then believe the rest. The 2% that's true above is the stuff about my wife and kids.The boring part of my bio is that I did time in Pendleton, got out, went to college and got my B.A. from Indiana University and an MFA in Writing from Vermont College. Among other things, I was a burglar, armed robber, worked as a male escort for wealthy older ladies, sold and did drugs, was an award-winning hairstylist, drove in high-speed car chases with the police (and got away), have been shot at and fired back several times, been beaten by the police but without anyone there to film it (I have to say I probably deserved it—I was kind of a smart ass), acted in an Indy movie (really bad one...), acted in commercials, coached youth baseball, hung around with rock stars (they actually do have groupies... serious ones with virtually no physical blemishes...), taught in various colleges and universities, and have nine books in print. I'm finishing up my memoir right now (tentative title: Adrenaline Junkie) which is a 350-page bio, basically, so if anyone reading this is interested, rush out and buy 10-15 copies when it comes out (Christmas is right around the corner and it'll make a perfect gift).I coach writers on writing their novels and if interested you can check me out at: www.lesedgerton.com.THANK YOU!No... thank you, Jay!

{"title": null, "date": "Sunday, June 29, 2008", "text": "I taught creative writing for three years at the University of Toledo and although I'm a year removed from that gig--now teaching at Trine University--I still get emails and phone calls and mail from students I was privileged to teach while there. I just got another email from one of my best students yesterday and thought folks might be interested in her story. She's a wonderful writer and it just so happens she's a young black woman. Normally, a writer's race wouldn't be notable, but in this case it is, I think.When she came to my class the first time, she told me that another professor in the department whose classes she'd taken before mine, had told her she needed to quit writing the fantasy novel she'd been working on for years and instead, write about her \"black experience.\" I was dumbfounded, especially since the young student told me she could care less about her so-called \"black experience,\" feeling that all she'd ever had was an \"American citizen experience,\" and what she really enjoyed reading and writing about was fantasy. But, she now had doubts. I told her that I thought this teacher's advice was the silliest I'd ever heard. What does it matter if she was black or white... or green or purple? Write what you want to write, I told her. If Samuel Delany had had a teacher like this woman had and told him he should only write about his \"black experience,\" we'd never have gotten to enjoy his wonderful sci-fi books.Well, my bright young student is finishing her novel (fantasy) and it's brilliant. She's graciously allowed me to \"coach\" her on it. It won't be long before she'll be in the process of securing an agent and sending her \"baby\" out into the world. Not a word in it about any \"black experience.\"Wonder what this teacher is going to say when her former student's book gets published...The first rule in teaching should be: Do no harm.Too bad some folks don't follow this precept.Blue skies,Les"}
