{"title": "Teachwise - A platform to save time and reduce stress for teachers", "date": "Monday 20 September 2021", "text": "Over the last couple of years the teaching profession has gone through huge changes and most of these have seen more demands put on teachers and greater pressure to spend more time using and adapting to new digital technologies for the remote and hybrid classroom.  Many of the demands and tools teachers have been presented with have required more of their time and a wider range of skills, so it's great to be asked to look at Teachwise which is one of those few technological tools that does the opposite. Teachwise is a planning, time-management and productivity tool that can genuinely help teachers to cope with the demands of teaching and save time planning.Once you have registered with Teachwise you can add your class schedule to the calendar. This is simple to do, and you can schedule classes for groups or individuals and add the students' names and the locations for the classes. This will also populate an attendance register so that Teachwise can help to track attendance for you.The next thing to do is start planning your lessons, and this is where you really start to save time. Teachwise has a huge collection of complete lesson plans or activities that you can simply add to your schedule. All the plans and activities are editable, so you can make changes to suit your students or drop out any activities you don't want to use.You can also add in your own activities or your own complete plans if you wish. You can store these in Teachwise and if you choose you can also add them to the Teachwise community.The Teachwise community is a great innovation and enables you to share materials, knowledge, tips and suggestions with all the other users and develop your expertise together.One of the other great things about Teachwise is that once you sign up for your free trial you'll be added to their email training list, so you'll get regular emails  with tips and video tutorials which will gradually help you to get the most out of the platform and the resources.Teachwise has 3 tiers of membership:Free (for teachers who just want to access the community and the activities) Individual (For teachers who want to schedule plans and manage their classes through the app) Schools (For schools that want to use it as their main teaching admin platform).See: PricingIf you work in or run a school, particularly a remote one with teachers based in different locations,  this is definitely worth looking into as it could make your administrative processes much easier to handle and provide the much-needed support and development through community that many remote teachers lack.I think Teachwise well worth signing up for a 1-month free trial that gives you access to all the features. I hope you find Teachwise useful, and it helps you to save lots of time and stress.More Teacher ResourcesYou can find links to many more resources like this and activities for the digital classroom in my e-books at: https://payhip.com/peacheypublicationsTo sign up for my free newsletter and get a free copy of Digital Tools for Teachers go to: http://eepurl.com/dtgL79Kind regardsNik Peachey | Director of Pedagogy - PeacheyPublications Ltd https://peacheypublications.com/"},
{"title": "ELT Songs to get your students singing, dancing and speaking", "date": "Friday 28 May 2021", "text": "I often dread looking at 'made for ELT' songs and music (I actually have a degree in music and studied jazz performance), but I was recently nicely surprised to see what ELT Songs have been doing on their site. They really seem to have got the knack of  approaching and creating songs for younger learners well and with obviously very high production values. If you check out the ELT Songs site you can find 58 units (with an additional 68 new units coming later this year). Each consisting of 6 videos per unit all of which are 100% aligned to the Cambridge Young Learners curriculum (starters, movers and flyers). The videos are great and really tap into the current K-Pop style with songs and synchronised dance moves and even UK sign language integrated in to help students understand the words while they sing and dance along and enjoy learning. The lesson videos from each unit cover conversation practice, pronunciation, vocabulary rap and grammar tutorials as well as karaoke where students can just sing along. The videos are hosted on Vimeo, so they are all high quality, can have closed captions on or off, and you aren't going to be surprised by any unsuitable ads. As well as the videos they provide teachers with downloadable lesson plans, worksheets, and flashcards. You can see a nice example here in the 'Downloads' section underneath the video panel: https://eltsongs.com/unit/planet-pop-unit-7/ As well as the core offer they have a great resources section that has videos with tips and advice from some of the best young learner materials writers in ELT publishing. These include:Katherine Bilsborough with speaking tips for young learners:https://eltsongs.com/resources/teach-tips-kath-speaking/ Amanda McLoughlin with tips for help students with numbers: https://eltsongs.com/resources/esl-lesson-plan-numbers-1-10/Michelle Worgan with tips to help students with grammar structures: https://eltsongs.com/resources/lesson-plan-31-michelle/ The blog is also another great resource and it has lots of materials, and activities around a wide range of topics.ELT Songs Blog I love this posting about International Women's Day and ideas for helping make students aware of issues around gender equality and download able lesson plan. This can be a difficult but really important issue to address with younger learners and they handle this in a really positive way.International Women's Day Not all the materials are free but there is a free trial that runs until the end of July, so that's lots of time to try things out and maybe even convince your school to make the purchase so that you get access to additional features like student tracking, fluency and pronunciation activities, Google Classroom integration and some free training.See pricing If your school isn't interested then individual teacher pricing is under $4 a month and that can save you a LOT of planning and preparation time so that seems like really great value for anyone who is teaching young learners.Overall ELT Songs is a really great resource with lots of really great speaking and listening activities for kids. I hope you and your students really enjoy it. More Teacher ResourcesYou can find links to many more resources like this and activities for the digital classroom in my e-books at: https://payhip.com/peacheypublicationsTo sign up for my free newsletter and get a free copy of Digital Tools for Teachers go to: http://eepurl.com/dtgL79 Check Out My Books:10 Business English Lessons Hacking Creativity10 Short Image Lessons 10 Lessons in Digital LiteracyDigital VideoThinking Critically through Digital Media BestNik Peachey"},
{"title": "Create Video Word Clouds with Quillionz Skimthru", "date": "Saturday 13 February 2021", "text": "If you’ve read my QuickShout blog before then you probably already know a little about Quillionz and their awesome AI based app that analyses text and creates comprehension questions in minutes. Well now they have a new tool for us to enjoy.Quillionz Skimthru is a word cloud creation tool with a difference. It actually analyses the closed captions from videos and creates word clouds that play in parallel to the video.This is really simple to use, just register on the Quillionz Skimthru site, then copy the link from your video and paste it into the interface field.Next add a title and select a domain for the video based on the type of content.Then just click on proceed. Wait a few minutes and the word cloud will appear beside the video.To skim through this video quickly, drag the dot on the progress bar of the Skimthru panel or video for a minute or more and release it.I really like this combination of word cloud and video, and it seems like a nice bridge to helping students understand the content, without going all the way to subtitles.If you make copies of the word clouds you can use them in a number of ways. You can pre-teach vocabulary from the word cloud.You can get students to predict content based on the word cloud.You can use the word clouds to prompt students' memory of the videos and help them to remember the content.Students can use the words from the word cloud to write summary statements about the video.Here’s an example I created from a short animated poem 'The Peace of Wild Things'. There are lots of useful videos on The Kids Should See This that you can use with students. They are very content rich and most have closed captions.Quillionz Skimthru has some limitations:It only works with YouTube videos at presentThe videos need to have closed captionsThe quality of the word cloud depends on the quality of the captions (mistakes in the captions cause mistakes in the word cloud)Quillionz Skimthru is an early release of a new tool, and it will be interesting to see how the company develops this.It would be great to have a bit more control over which and how many words appear in the cloud and also when and how often it changes, but even without these features it’s a really useful tool for supporting students understanding of video content.I hope you use and enjoy it with your students.More Teacher ResourcesYou can find links to many more resources like this and activities for the digital classroom in my e-books at: https://payhip.com/peacheypublicationsTo sign up for my free newsletter and get a free copy of Digital Tools for Teachers go to: http://eepurl.com/dtgL79 Check Out My Books:10 Business English Lessons Hacking Creativity10 Short Image Lessons 10 Lessons in Digital LiteracyDigital VideoThinking Critically through Digital Media BestNik Peachey"},
{"title": "Create Reading Comprehension Activities for the Remote Classroom with Quillionz", "date": "Friday 16 October 2020", "text": "I first wrote about Quillionz back in 2018 and it’s great to see how far the product has come since then. At that time it was a free product that used AI to generate questions based around any text that you entered. You could then select and edit the questions you wanted to use and print these for the classroom.These features are still available and there is still a lifetime free subscription available, but they have now added more features and developed some premium features that make this a product worth investing, especially if you need to create a lot of reading materials based around authentic text.Just to recap, creating questions is very easy. You can just copy paste in your text, give it a title, select the educational domain it belongs to and then choose the keywords from the text that you want the reader to focus on. You can also bypass the keyword selection process and get Quillionz to choose for you if you choose.Quillionz will then review your text for you and highlight any weaknesses in the writing, such as lengthy sentences, subjectivity or incomplete sentences.Next Quillionz uses AI to analyse the text and generate sets of questions for you to choose from. Once the questions appear you can select and edit the ones you want to use with your text. Quillionz creates a number of different types of questions for you to use.  This includes short answers, multiple choice and ‘recall’ questions (these are ones where they have to fill a gap in a sentence with the missing word from the text). The premium version Quillionz also includes WH questions and interpretive questions which push students to give more complex and open ended answers. Once the questions have been created and you have chosen the ones you want to use, you have a number of ways of sharing them with students. You can either download them as a document by clicking on ‘Export’ or you can click on ‘Create Quillionz’. This option creates a sequence of flashcards that you can share with students. The students can then read the text and try to answer the questions and click on the flashcard to see the answer.  You share the flashcards by using a link, so this will work really well in the remote classroom and it will allow students to each work at their own speed.There is another option for exporting the questions to Raptivity. This is another product I’ve reviewed on this site. Raptivity enables you to turn the questions set in to a range of html5 interactive learning objects that can be deployed in online courses. So this can speed up the process of creating online courses considerably.Another great new feature is that Quillionz will also produce summary notes of the text featuring the main points. Again you can edit this for accuracy before saving the notes.All of the texts you use and the questions you create can be saved in the dashboard so it’s easy to retrieve texts and re-edit them for revision or for a different group of students.One of the things that I really like about Quillionz is that you can quite quickly and easily teach students to use it and then they can create their own revision quizzes and create quizzes for each other. The summary notes will also be really useful for students. You can click here to check the price of a premium subscription and compare packages.I hope you enjoy using this tool and that it saves you some time when creating comprehension activities.  More Teacher ResourcesYou can find links to many more resources like this and activities for the digital classroom in my ebooks at: https://payhip.com/peacheypublicationsTo sign up for my free newsletter and get a free copy of Digital Tools for Teachers go to: http://eepurl.com/dtgL79 Check Out My Books:10 Business English Lessons Hacking Creativity10 Short Image Lessons 10 Lessons in Digital LiteracyDigital VideoThinking Critically through Digital Media BestNik Peachey"},
{"title": "Create blended and flipped learning materials on the fly with TeacherToolsDigital", "date": "Friday 2 October 2020", "text": "With the rapid and sudden increase in remote teaching and learning many schools and teachers are finding it hard to manage the smaller class sizes that remote learning supports and still give students the hours of study and practice they need to move their learning forward.Many schools have turned to blended learning to fill the gap, but soon discovered that creating high quality blended learning courses takes time, money and a specific set of skills which many of their teachers don’t completely cover.Luckily there is a solution to this problem that will enable teachers to create pedagogically sound online tasks and activities that can be adapted to students’ needs with minimal time and effort. The solution is TeacherTools.Digital.TeacherTools.Digital has a great collection of skills based language practice activities that can be quickly adapted and deployed to get students producing language outside of class time whether it’s in a flipped, blended, hybrid, or fully online learning approach.The site has eight basic activity types and these range from the usual gap filling types exercises to ones that students can submit using voice, text or even their video webcam.The easiest way to get started with TeacherTools.Digital is to try some of the ready made and then just adapt them and add your own content and ideas.If you click on browse underneath each activity type you can scroll through a range of activities. When you select one you’ll see how it is structured and then you can easily change the various elements of the activity to suit your needs.One of my favourite activity types is the one that enables students to submit a video response using their webcam. I think this is a great tool to help students work on their visual communications skills and with the move towards more remote working, this is becoming a vital work/life skill for many of our students.The Read Aloud activity type is also really useful as it enables you to set speaking activities for students that they can do at home and they get instant feedback on their performance as they read each line. This can increase their speaking practice time and reduce your homework marking time.When you have created an activity you get a link that you can share with students and all of their results are tracked into the TeacherTools.Digital LMS, so you know how your students are progressing and which ones are completing their homework assignments.As I said, I think this is a great solution to increase the amount of meaningful practice students have with language and to reduce some of the workload being placed on teachers. You can try TeacherTools.Digital for free for 30 days, after that you’ll need to pay $9.99 a month (See pricing). This can be really worth the amount of time it can save you. At present there is no price on the  schools account, but it may be worth trying to get your school to enquire as substantial discounts are available when signing up multiple teachers from the same institution at the same time.TeacherTools.Digital is also integrates with a wide range of LMS, so if your school already has a platform for building blended learning then it's quite easy to use TeacherTools.Digital to extend the range of activity types that you can offer.As a special offer for readers of Nik's Quickshout. The good folks at TeacherTools.Digital are offering an additional 10% discount on top of the already discounted yearly rate of $99, bringing it down to only $89. What's more, your subscription will continue to renew at this price in subsequent years! This offer is only available to the first 25 users to redeem the following coupon code: PEACHEY-YEARLY-2020.I hope you enjoy using this great tool and that it helps to reduce your workload and increase your students’ learning.

{"title": "Ready to Run with authentic video lessons that are classroom-ready for levels A1 - B2", "date": "Tuesday 28 April 2020", "text": "Over the last decade, video has become one of the key drivers of online learning and nowhere more so than in language learning. It has the power to reach beyond words and sounds and show students a range of non-verbal communication features as well as taking them to places and peoples around the world that they may never be able to access physically.Despite the power of video, one of the greatest difficulties of using authentic video with language students has always been level. Authentic video has often been seen as too challenging for lower-level students, and much of the graded, made for language teaching material is so cringingly inauthentic that it is almost too embarrassing to use, especially for teenagers and young adults.Finally, though it looks like Digital Learning Associates (DLA) have solved the problem with their award-winning Ready to Run series of videos and learning materials.The Ready to Run VideosIf you check out the Ready to Run catalogue you’ll see that they have a great range of really diverse, inclusive and most importantly interesting videos that cover a really broad range of geographies, topics, cultures and lifestyles.The videos have been categorised using the CEFR so it’s really easy to find the ones that are appropriate for the level of your students and there is a range of video at each level from A1 up to B2.The videos are professionally produced with really high-quality camera work and audio and as I mentioned earlier they are engaging enough to hold the attention of a native speaker solely on the interest level of the content.The Teaching and Learning MaterialsThe series is entitled Ready to Run and it is exactly that. Most of the videos have PDF materials that you can download and use immediately with your students as well as a teachers guide and copies of transcripts.Another of the great things about the videos is that it’s also possible to open the captions so that students can read the transcript as the watch and for students who are really struggling the settings allow you to slow the video down. Here’s an example video from a South African Vlogger. The video is about what she’s doing to pass the time during the lockdown.SubscriptionsReady to Run is a subscription service with a range of subscription packages.Video Star - Which is free and gives you access to 10 videos with lesson materials from a range of levels. These are updated with new content every month.Video Pro - Which gives you access to 35 units of material ranging A1 to B2. At present, you can also get the Video Pro package for free for the duration of the COVID-19 pandemic.Video School - This gives you and the teachers at your school unlimited access to the complete catalogue for £79 a month.Finally, if you check out the Ready to Run blog you’ll also see some interesting postings about how to use the materials online for virtual teaching as well as some posts about new and upcoming content.So whether you are teaching online or looking forward to getting back into the classroom now is a great time to sign up and get some really interesting and engaging materials that can save you hours of preparation.More Teache ResourcesYou can find links to many more resources like this and activities for the digital classroom in my ebooks at: https://payhip.com/peacheypublicationsTo sign up for my free newsletter and get a free copy of Digital Tools for Teachers go to: http://eepurl.com/dtgL79Check Out My Books:10 Business English Lessons Hacking Creativity10 Short Image Lessons 10 Lessons in Digital LiteracyDigital VideoThinking Critically through Digital Media BestNik Peachey"},
{"title": "Using the bulb digital portfolio to keep up with qualitative assessment of student work online", "date": "Friday 24 April 2020", "text": "In the rapid shift to online learning that’s taking place at present, there’s one thing that can easily get overlooked - the value of qualitative evaluation. What better tool to do that with than a digital portfolio tool like bulb?bulb is simple to use, works on mobile as well as in the browser and it gives your students the opportunity to collect and showcase their work using a modern and stylish design.Creating a profile To get started, all you need to do is create a free profile. All you need is an image and a short description of who you are.Once you have your profile created you can start collecting together any digital assets you would like to include in your portfolio.Collecting your work You can access your asset library by clicking on the icon in the top right of the screen. You or your students can add a wide variety of digital assets to your library. These could be an audio recording, documents, images, videos, or work they have stored on Google Drive or OneDrive. Interestingly, students can also record audio directly into the asset library, which may well be useful for collecting examples of student’s spoken work.The asset library is a great place for students to collect their work as it’s totally private so they can wait until they are ready to publish something before they add it to a page.Once students have their work in the asset library they can create Pages or Collections. A Collection is a number of Pages collected together, much like a folder. This makes it easier for students to collect and categorize their pages into different topics or subjects.Creating pages Creating pages is very easy. Click to create a page, give the page a title and add a cover image. Then start typing in content. Click on ‘Enter’ to start a new line and you will get the option for adding assets from your library or uploading new media assets such as images, video, audio and more.Apart from its simplicity, one really nice feature of the editor is the ability to create image carousels. Once you have added one image you can simply click on the image icon to add additional images. This makes the collections of images look more professional and users don’t need to scroll down a long page.Once students have completed their page they can publish it. They can either make the page public, create a private link, or share it with specific users or groups. This makes it much easier for students to share work with peers to get feedback and comments or just their teacher or parents.Another nice feature of the site is that you can create pages and share them as templates. This enables other users to make copies of the page and use them to add their own content. This is a great feature to enable you to create worksheets for students that they can complete or to provide a format and structure for the work that they do.Creating groups If you are using bulb with students and particularly if you are using it with multiple classes, then the Groups feature is going to be really useful. To create a group you go back to the menu and select groups and then ‘Create Group’.  Give your group a name and description, then create a unique URL.Once you have created a group you can add members by either entering their email or username or you can give students a code to add themselves as members of the group.Now that students are in a group they can easily share and comment on each other's work and you can share work and templates with them as well as assessing and evaluating their work.Sharing One last feature that I really like about bulb is once pages are published they can be used in presentation mode. This opens them as fullscreen without all the editing and navigation tools, so that students can present their work in the classroom.If you are a Google Classroom user you will also be happy to know that bulb works alongside Classroom.That’s about all there is to it. bulb is a really stylish tool to use with your students, that they or their parents can access in the home that enables peer to peer evaluation as well as tutor evaluation and assessment of work.I hope you find this a really useful addition to your digital teaching toolset.More Tools You can find links to many more resources like this and activities for the digital classroom in my ebooks at: https://payhip.com/peacheypublicationsTo sign up for my free newsletter and get a free copy of Digital Tools for Teachers go to: http://eepurl.com/dtgL79Check Out My Books:10 Business English Lessons Hacking Creativity10 Short Image Lessons 10 Lessons in Digital LiteracyDigital VideoThinking Critically through Digital Media BestNik Peachey"},
{"title": "Add learning activities and games to your zoom classroom with Raptivity", "date": "Tuesday 31 March 2020", "text": "In these difficult times when schools and universities are rushing to develop credible and engaging online learning, Raptivity 2020 looks like a really useful low-cost tool to enable that process.Raptivity 2020 is a great content authoring tool and is capable of creating dynamic and media-rich learning that is adaptive across mobile, tablet and desktop screens.One of the striking things about Raptivity is just how simple it is to create great looking materials. When you log in, there are two parts to the dashboard, one area where your work is stored and the other where you create content.There are a good range of content types with a good balance between presentation formats and gaming/testing types.Each content type has an example so you can see how it works and what it looks like to students and then you can just select the ones you want and customise them with your own content.These are some examples of the presentation types:Layered Display: This content type allows the students to choose from a range of topics within the main theme. Understanding sexual harassment. Panning Slides: This content type is more like a linear presentation with a menu at the side so students can jump around a little. Example: Fruit and Vegetables Horizontal Parallax: This content type is more like a timeline that students can work through. Example: The #MeeToo Timeline  These are some examples of the game type activities:This one is based around a bowling alley. Students answer question to get the opportunity to bowl and see whether they got the answer correct.  ExampleThis one is based around a mouse trying to get cheese. Students answer questions correctly and the mouse gets the cheese, but if they make enough mistakes, the cat scares the mouse away. Example All of these content types can easily be customised with your own content. This includes adding audio narration for each slide and embedding your own video from social media.Once you have added your content to the slides and games you can see what they look like on either tablets or phones in both horizontal and vertical mode.Once you have saved your finished activities they are stored in the 'MyWork' section and from there you can either publish and share them through social media or email or export them for use in your own learning platform. All of the content produced is SCORM compliant.You can also run the published content while screen sharing during a live class in Zoom or any other online classroom, or pass links to students through chat so they can do activities in pairs or breakout rooms.Raptivity has a free 14-day trial which should be more than enough time to learn how to use the tool and produce some engaging content. Signing up for a year is very economical compared to other similar platforms. There doesn't seem to be a monthly plan at present, but at time of writing there is a 25% reduction.PricingRaptivity is well worth a try if you want to quickly create online learning content that's both engaging, media-rich and which looks fresh and professionally designed.You can find links to many more resources like this and activities for the digital classroom in my ebooks at: https://payhip.com/peacheypublicationsTo sign up for my free newsletter and get a free copy of Digital Tools for Teachers go to: http://eepurl.com/dtgL79Check Out My Books:10 Business English Lessons Hacking Creativity10 Short Image Lessons 10 Lessons in Digital LiteracyDigital VideoThinking Critically through Digital Media BestNik Peachey"},
{"title": "Plexie for collaborative online creation", "date": "Wednesday 18 March 2020", "text": "Plexie is a really interesting web-based app and quite a hard one to define. Basically it allows teams to work collaboratively in a web-based document to produce digital content that can either be published and shared publicly or kept private for only limited team members.When you create your first Plexie, you create an online workspace. This allows you to create a number of digital documents that you can either work on with a team or keep private.Creating a new document is easy, you just click on ‘Create Plexie’ and give your document a name.Once you have your document in your workspace you can start adding different ‘Cards’ to it. It’s a good idea to start off with some idea of what you want to create and figure out how you want to layout your workspace. This is particularly true if you want to work with a team.You could assign different team members different cards to work on or everyone could work together.Once you have your layout created you can start adding content to each card. You can easily add a wide range of content, from images, video and documents to text and hyperlinks to other content.At each step of the way, you can just click on ‘View’ to see what your final product will look like.You can also add additional pages to each Plexie in a similar way that you would if you were designing a website with multiple pages.Plexie is a simple to use tool, but can also be used to create quite high quality visually pleasing content if you want to work with it and develop your skills a little.When you have finished you can share your Plexie by clicking on 'Share’ and then turning on link sharing. This will make the Plexie visible to anyone who has the link.To make this whole process easier, Plexie has just introduced a number of templates that you can choose from that you just need to select and add your own content to. Like this one for collaboratively creating a lesson plan.Why use Plexie?I think this a great tool for working with younger learners to develop their digital literacy skills. It provides you with a very safe collaborative environment that you can then share with parents once the work is finished.This would be a great tool to enable teachers to develop and share lesson plans within their school or staffroom. They can work on the plans collaboratively or individually and then access each others’ plans and materials online.You could use Plexie to get students doing language analysis of grammar points. Just set up a Plexie for the grammar point you want them to explore. Add cards for each of the aspects of the grammar point you want them to investigate, such as form, meaning, pronunciation, Students could use Plexie to create the framework and plan for a project as part of a PBL cycle. This would enable them to work on the project output together and then share and make it public when they have finished.Plexie is ideal for creating video-based lessons. You can embed the video into one of the cards and have your instructions on a second card. Answers could be set up on a second page.Similarly, you could add an infographic to a Plexie and get students to fact check the information in it and use a card each to share what they discovered about the topic. This would help them to develop their digital literacies and critical thinking skills.Students could use a Plexie as a ‘vision board’ and collect examples of things that inspire them or that they aspire to do.Students could use Plexie as a digital portfolio and collect and keep examples of their best work there.There are also some nice examples on the Plexie site that show some of the range of uses for Plexie. I especially liked the idea of having CV/Resume on the site like this one. As you can see, Plexie is a very flexible and adaptable tool with a wide range of potential uses. The free pricing plan is also very generous and enables teams of up to 100 people to work on one workspace. I guess that should be enough for most classes.You can find links to many more resources like this and activities for the digital classroom in my ebooks at: https://payhip.com/peacheypublicationsTo sign up for my free newsletter and get a free copy of Digital Tools for Teachers go to: http://eepurl.com/dtgL79Check Out My Books:10 Business English Lessons Hacking Creativity10 Short Image Lessons 10 Lessons in Digital LiteracyDigital VideoThinking Critically through Digital Media BestNik Peachey"},
{"title": "Actively Learn - A Huge Resource of Ready-Made Interactive Learning for English Language Learners", "date": "Friday 28 February 2020", "text": "Actively Learn isn’t just a great source of learning content for grades 6 through to 12, though if you are teaching adult learners much of the grade 12 content would still be appropriate. It’s also an LMS that enables you to create and track the use of learning materials across your classes, and a teacher development tool that enables you to train teachers in aspects of materials development and instructional design.Ready-Made Content for ELAActively Learn already has a really substantial amount of readymade interactive learning content when you log in. The content is easy to browse or search, initially by subject (ELA, Science or Social Studies) and then by a range of different parameters, from grade to topic to theme or genre.Once you have found some interesting looking content for your students you can click through to see the activities that have been designed for it and the guidance notes for the teacher. There is also a brief introduction to the text. The questions that you can see as you scroll through the text are interactive and when the text is assigned to the student their responses will be tracked into the reporting part of the site.If you want to change some of the questions or add cultural notes or word definitions through the text you can also do this, just click on the ‘Customize’ button at the top of the screen.To add notes, questions or definitions to words, just highlight them and you will see a menu appear.Once you have your text and all of the tasks ready, just click on ‘Assign’ and the text will be sent to the class that you choose. Creating Classes and Measuring LearningSetting up classes is simple. Just click on ‘Add new class’ on the main menu and you’ll be able to give the class a name and select the grade of the students. You get a simple code to give to students that enables them to enroll in your class. Once the students start to interact with the content you’ll be able to track their work through the Gradebook and Student data. You can also get an overall view of the class data.Creating and Customizing ContentActively Learn isn’t just for the development of reading skills though, you can also access or create your own content based around online video. Just select ‘Video’ on the ‘Genre’ tab and you’ll see the selection of ready-made video content. When you select a video you’ll see that it has question marks beneath the video play bar. When the students get to this point in the video it will pause and show them a question. By clicking on ‘Customize’ and then clicking on the play bar you can either edit or add new questions to the video.If you decide you want to add your own content, then click on ‘Import’ and select the type of content you want to add. You can then start to add interactions and questions to it before assigning it to a class.Actively Learn for Teacher DevelopmentAs I said at the beginning of this article, Actively Learn is also a tool for teacher development and has some really well-structured learning activities for teachers that will help them use the platform more successfully. To find these materials click on ‘Professional Learning’ in the menu.The Professional Learning section starts with a research paper that teachers can read and comment on. The interactions around this paper will be shared with other teachers who are registered at the same school. The platform then has a collection of sequenced activities that teachers can work through to develop different aspects of their professional knowledge whilst helping them to use the platform more effectively with some ‘hands-on tasks’. Actively Learn PlansActively Learn is a pretty impressive platform with a great and constantly growing bank of materials. As a teacher you can sign up for an individual account and use Actively Learn for free, but for the real power of the platform, along with API integrations into Google Classrooms, SIS or another LMS, you’ll need a premium plan. These plans are negotiated with schools according to what elements of the platform and integration they need and the number of students involved. At the school level, it’s clear to see how Actively Learn could have really clear and measurable benefits that could have genuine impact on students’ learning.You can find links to many more resources like this and activities for the digital classroom in my ebooks at: https://payhip.com/peacheypublicationsTo sign up for my free newsletter and get a free copy of Digital Tools for Teachers go to: http://eepurl.com/dtgL79Check Out My Books:10 Business English Lessons Hacking Creativity10 Short Image Lessons 10 Lessons in Digital LiteracyDigital VideoThinking Critically through Digital Media"},
{"title": "Vocab Victor for developing vocabulary knowledge", "date": "Wednesday 15 January 2020", "text": "Vocab Victor is a great app and resource for developing vocabulary. I say app and resource because as well as the free app you can download from the site, there are also some great resources on the website.Let's start with the app though. The Vocab Victor app is a really useful example of gamified vocabulary development. The app has 14 levels and the user has to work through the levels playing different kinds of games to learn different types of word knowledge for hundreds of words.There are 5 different types of game for developing vocabulary.Word strike which is like a word association multiple choice game.Word find which is like the classic word search activity.Word drop which requires students to choose which of two words has the strongest association to the keyword.Word lock which requires students to match words to definitions.And a daily challenge game which focuses on collocations and word grammar.The games are attractive and very intuitive. Students can also review the words they have studied and as they work through the games they earn charms. They can use these charms to get help or to move on when they get stuck with a word.There's also a leader board that they can use to see how they are doing in comparison to others playing the game.The web site includes a word study resource, which lets students find more information for selected words, and even a video which gives an example of the pronunciation in use in a YouTube video.There is also a vocabulary challenge course that has videos and information to help students learn 20 new words a week over 25 weeks.Vocab Victor is a great free resource for students. It's probably best suited to students who are around an intermediate (B1 +) level as some of the words are quite difficult, but it can adapt to the students level, so if students are getting a lot of words wrong then it will find lower-level words.Vocab Victor is a  great tool to use in class as a filler activity or better still get your students to download the app and practise in their free time. The app works on both iOS and Android.You can find links to many more resources like this and activities for the digital classroom in my ebooks at: https://payhip.com/peacheypublicationsI also curate a collection of tools for developing vocabulary her on Mix: Vocabulary Development Tools To sign up for my free newsletter and get a free copy of Digital Tools for Teachers go to: http://eepurl.com/dtgL79Check Out My Books:10 Business English Lessons Hacking Creativity10 Short Image Lessons 10 Lessons in Digital LiteracyDigital VideoThinking Critically through Digital Media BestNik Peachey"},
{"title": "Eduflow for building online, blended and flipped courses", "date": "Wednesday 8 January 2020", "text": "If you are looking for a fast and simple way to build online courses or digitise your existing courses then Eduflow could be the tool for you.What I really like about Eduflow is that it takes a lot of the work out of the course construction process by having ready-made blocks or 'flows' that you can just select and add your content to.Using Eduflow to create an online courseTo create a course on Eduflow, just register and then click on 'Create or Join'. This will enable you to give your course a name and create it.Once the course is created it simple to add activities to it, just click on 'Add activities & flows'.You can then add content to your course. Content could be a mixture of text, images, links videos or you could upload a file for students.Once you have created your content you can set up rules to define when and for how long students can access the content. This is really useful if you want to blend the course with work you're doing in the classroom and ensure that the online work is done at a specific time. It should also help to reduce student procrastination, which is one of the big negative impacts of online learning.Once the content is created you can use flows to define how your students will respond to it and who and how their response will be evaluated.There are two kinds of ready-made 'flows'. These are peer-reviewed assignment flows or instructor reviewed assignment flows.The flows are in three parts: The student submits their work, the work is reviewed either by a peer or the instructor and then the students submit a reflection on their feedback. This three-part flow really encourages deeper learning and puts far more emphasis on the quality of feedback and understanding rather than just whether students have got things right or wrong. Again this approach helps to combat one of the most common weaknesses of online courses that rely on computer configured responses to students' input.If you aren't happy with these flows or you want to customise them you can create your own or add additional stages.Once you've created your course content and assignments you can easily add students to the course by giving them a simple link or you can invite them by email.Tracking student progress is also simple and you can also set up notifications so that you know when student work has been submitted.So that's how to create a course with Eduflow Eduflow looks like a great tool to create blended or flipped courses on the fly as you teach the face-to-face element of the course.You could set up a totally online course and invite your students via email or a link.Eduflow's focus on feedback and reflection also makes it an ideal e-portfolio tool to collect student work over the semester. What does it cost?You can use Eduflow for free to create two courses for up to 50 students. After that, you do have to pay, but prices are very reasonable so whether you want to use it for a whole school solution or to get started delivering online courses independently, then Eduflow is a great, fast and easy to learn solution to get you up and running quickly.You can find links to many more resources like this and activities for the digital classroom in my ebooks at: https://payhip.com/peacheypublicationsTo sign up for my free newsletter and get a free copy of Digital Tools for Teachers go to: http://eepurl.com/dtgL79Check Out My Books:10 Business English Lessons Hacking Creativity10 Short Image Lessons 10 Lessons in Digital LiteracyDigital VideoThinking Critically through Digital Media BestNik Peachey"},
{"title": "What is the role of automated writing assessment in ELT?", "date": "Monday 2 December 2019", "text": "Whenever I share a link to some form of tool that helps students or teachers to evaluate writing skills, it is inevitable that within a few hours I'll get a comment from somebody saying \"I typed in xxxx error and [enter whatever tool you wish here] didn't spot it or correct it.\" Usually, the sentence with the error in is complete gibberish and one that a teacher would instantly see as such but one which can sometimes fool computer-based assessment software for exactly that reason. Gibberish can be very difficult to correct.Having said that though we all know from spelling and grammar checking that all digital tools for the assessment and correction of writing still lack the judgement and expertise of experienced writing teacher and most will always miss something or spot something that turns out not to be an error. I have, however, found the same to be true of human markers. Especially when faced with piles of essay assignments to mark after a long day in the classroom, people make mistakes too. Interestingly, The Educational Testing Service in New Jersey has been working on an e-Rater system to automate admission test scoring.  They have concluded that a human rating combined with an automatic rating is more reliable than two human raters since humans tend to diverge in their judgements.So the question is: If these tools are fallible can they still be pedagogically useful?For me, the answer would be yes. What this means though is that we need to teach our students to use these tools in combination with and to develop their own powers of judgement to become more independent learners. Let's be clear that doesn't just mean independent from the teacher but also free from the dependence on writing support tools.Whenever I work with any kind of writing support tools I'm reminded of an episode of the sitcom Friends in which the character Joey needs to write a formal letter and discovers that using a digital thesaurus can make the words he uses sound more intelligent.You can watch the clip here to see the outcome: The Thesaurus What this highlights is that teachers and students need to work with these tools with a clear understanding of their limitations and a need to develop and use their own judgement when deciding whether to take the advice of the program.Personally, I think this makes for a great classroom activity. If you can get a text with a variety of mistakes and different feedback suggestions from the online tool that students want to use, then you can get the students to evaluate the feedback and try to decide how accurate and useful they think it is. This is a great way to get students thinking more critically about language and encouraging them to reflect on their own writing. Once they are familiar with the tool, students should write their own essays and use the tool again to get feedback on their draft. As time progresses though I'm sure these various writing support tools will continue to develop and evolve into better versions of themselves. Through the use of AI and machine learning, computers are becoming much better at understanding context and its connection to the use of language. This is particularly true when the computer has a clear framework understanding of what the student needs to achieve. A great example of this is the Film Review Analysis tool on the Virtual Writing Tutor site This tool gives students clear guidelines and rubric for what they need to write and then measures their input against those criteria. This narrows down the risk of error and enables the program to give very detailed feedback on the various criteria the assignment is being marked against. The program then checks:for a question at the beginning of the introductionthesis and topic sentence strength to help students strengthen their claimsthe count of citations in body paragraphs to encourage students to use evidence to support their argumentsthesis reformulation in the conclusion to promote paraphrasing as contextualized skillliterary and film analysis vocabulary scores to encourage students to increase the active range of their vocabularyThe other great strength of these tools have over teachers of course is time. A digital platform like Grammar.ly or https://virtualwritingtutor.com can handle tens of thousands of texts each minute and students can keep coming back to them with written work every hour if they need to, whereas teacher-marking-time is expensive and very definitely finite and I would  be surprised if on average a teacher marks more than one or two pieces of written work from each student in a week.With demands on teacher time growing and the capabilities of automated writing support improving all the time, I feel these tools can deliver an increasingly important contribution to the development of our students writing skills.You can find links to many more resources like this and activities for the digital classroom in my ebooks at: https://payhip.com/peacheypublicationsTo sign up for my free newsletter and get a free copy of Digital Tools for Teachers go to: http://eepurl.com/dtgL79Check Out My Books:10 Business English Lessons Hacking Creativity10 Short Image Lessons 10 Lessons in Digital LiteracyDigital VideoThinking Critically through Digital Media BestNik Peachey"},
{"title": "Setting students speaking tasks for homework with Extempore", "date": "Monday 25 November 2019", "text": "More than any other skill, students and employers tend to value the ability to speak English most, and yet speaking seems to be one of the more difficult skills for teachers to develop and refine in the classroom.There are many reasons for this including class size, the amount of noise created by speaking activities in the classroom and the need for a more personalised learning approach which deals with the individual needs of the student. Having the ability to listen to and deal with the needs of each student in a class of only ten or twenty can put huge demand on the teachers during classroom speaking activities, but with Extempore, there seems to be a solution to that problem.Extempore enables teachers to create and set speaking activities for students as homework. Using the extempore LMS and app, teachers can create speaking activities for students that they can do at home using their mobile phone or computer. They can record their homework using either voice or video, which is then pushed to the teacher through the LMS. Teachers can then listen to each individual students and record personalised feedback for them using audio, video or text.This process really enhances the teacher's ability to listen carefully to each student and respond to them in on a very engaging and personalised level.Extempore makes it very easy to create tasks. Once you register on Extempore you just create a class and then start adding tasks and assignments. When you create these tasks you can set a due date for the task and decide whether it is a group task or an individual task. When using individual tasks, only the teacher can see and respond to the task, whereas group tasks will enable multiple students to interact with each other.You can then decide whether you want to enable students to submit audio or video. Audio will be easier for students to submit, but using video can also enable you to work on some of the visual aspects of communication and help students to get used to communicating through video online (a very useful 21st-century skill).You also have the option of showing students what the assessment criteria will be for their assignment and set a limit to how many times students can review their recording before submitting it.Once all this has been done, you just need to add some questions or tasks to get students talking.There are lots of different types of assignments you can set for your students.You can use the assignments as part of a learner diary and get students eating and reflecting on their learning goals after each class. (You can find out more about Learning Diaries in an article I wrote for the Teaching English website.)You can send students texts or short stories to read in a dramatic and expressive way.You can get students to record themselves reading a favourite poem.You can get the students to interact and share opinions on controversial issues.You can get students to create a collaborative story by sending them an introductory sentence and asking each to add a few lines to it.You can get students to record project reports or research assignments.You can control time to review and respond, so you can use it for high stakes exams and to set assessment tests. Once you have created your assignment you can share a link with students and they'll be able to register with extempore, see their assignments and download the free Extempore app for their mobile device.Once they have completed their assignment you can find them in the 'Grading' section of the LMS. You can then listen and respond to their assignments. All scores are then added to the Gradebook. This also enables you to build up a digital portfolio of each students' work which you can reflect on to track and evaluate their progress over a longer time span. To find out more about how this works check out the demo videos.Extempore looks like a really useful application for developing students' speaking and one that will make your life as a teacher a little easier and make your feedback on students' speaking abilities more impactful.Extempore isn't a free service, although there is a free 30-day trial which is well worth trying.Payment for the service can either be charged to the individual students (which may be useful if you have private clients who want to develop their speaking skills) or schools can buy sets of licenses for their students. the cost is really very reasonable especially given that each license is for a year rather than a month.You can find links to many more resources like this and activities for the digital classroom in my ebooks at: https://payhip.com/peacheypublicationsTo sign up for my free newsletter and get a free copy of Digital Tools for Teachers go to: http://eepurl.com/dtgL79Check Out My Books:10 Business English Lessons Hacking Creativity10 Short Image Lessons 10 Lessons in Digital LiteracyDigital VideoThinking Critically through Digital Media BestNik Peachey"},
{"title": "Video-based Lesson Plans for ELT and ESL Classroom", "date": "Friday 8 November 2019", "text": "I've just had the great pleasure of looking around the Fluentize website and I have to say that I'm really impressed.Fluentize is a collection of really high quality lesson plans and materials based around authentic online videos.The lesson plans are very detailed and in most there is enough materials for around a 2 hour lesson, although it would also be easy to select a few of the activities and leave some of the others.The lesson plans are really well structured with listening, vocabulary, writing, speaking and grammar focus activities that all look well thought out and appropriate for the level.Fluentize offers plans for Level A2 to C1. At present it looks like the bulk of the material is around the B1 and B2 levels, which is the point at which it's great to start encouraging students to use authentic materials.The videos have been really well chosen. They are high quality, short and are based on interesting and engaging content.I really enjoyed one based around Will Smith having a date with a robot and another showing an interaction with a Google Assistant.All the plans also have teachers' notes guides, so these are pretty much no prep ready to go materials.Fluentize isn't a free site, although there are some free sample plans which you should try out: https://app.fluentize.com/lessons/sampleIf you like the plans and want to get more then you can buy individual plans for as little as $2.99 or you can buy packs of 10 plans and get a 17% discount. You can also take advantage of their monthly or quarterly subscriptions for a better value.Check out prices hereThe cheapest way to get the Fluentize plans is to sign up for a subscription. If you think other teachers in your school will like them then it may be worth getting your school to subscribe as school subscriptions are very reasonable and white labelling is also a possibility.These plans are really great and very professionally produced. They are ideal for anyone working with teenagers and adults.

{"title": "Using Computer Games to Improve Students' English", "date": "Tuesday 8 October 2019", "text": "I’ve had a long interest in the use of computer games for English language teaching and have looked at lots of games over the years that have huge potential for language learning, from platforms like Second Life and Minecraft to more structured educational games like PowerUp and Tyto, so when I spotted Real English for Gamers, a site that sets out to help students use a variety of multi-player games to improve their English, I was really fascinated.What it’s aboutReal English for Gamers isn’t a game but it is at the most basic level, a YouTube channel full of videos of game in game interaction between players that have been turned into learning resources.The creators of the channel have taken clips of world famous gamers playing the games, transcribed them, analysed the vocabulary and interaction between the players and turned them into instructional videos that help students to learn English with the aim of enabling them to play their favourite games in English.This is a great idea in many ways as so many students find playing video games so engaging and to combine this enthusiasm for the games with the chance to interact with other speakers of English can really be a boost for their motivation. How to use itThe Real English for Gamers YouTube channel has around 130 videos at time of writing and these are mostly clips from multiplayer games. Their website helps to structure this collection of videos and make it more accessible. Some of the best places to start are:Examples: This section has links to YouTube playlists with sections on grammar for gamers, vocabulary for gamers, general help for learning English through games. The Basics: This section has a collection of useful language for gamers that they can use whilst playing the games.  This includes a section on questions they can ask their gaming partner during the game, common game related vocabulary and tips for how to avoid misunderstandings during the game.Practice Listening: This section helps students to deal with fast authentic speech by using short video clips with video script annotation. The Gamers: This section has information about each of the celebrity gamers featured in the video clips. The Games: This section has information about each of the games featured in the clips.The site is being regularly updated and apart form watching and listening to the videos, students can also leave comments and chat with other users using the comments feature in the YouTube channel.Real English for Gamers is an interesting concept and a great resource to recommend to students who are interested in games or as a source of learning material for homework or the classroom. It is of course a good idea to select videos that you feel are age and culturally appropriate for your students. Due to the nature of the content, some games will have language related to violence in them and others may have some bad language, so you’ll need to decide whether your students are mature enough to deal with these elements.For students who are already keen on games this could be a tool to help them to make the shift to playing them in English and for students who are interested in games the content could form the basis of some motivating lessons that exploit authentic materials.I hope you enjoy Real English for Gamers and that your students find it useful.You can find links to many more tools like this and activities for the digital classroom in my ebooks at: https://payhip.com/peacheypublicationsTo sign up for my free newsletter and get a free copy of Digital Tools for Teachers go to: http://eepurl.com/dtgL79Check Out My Books:10 Business English Lessons Hacking Creativity10 Short Image Lessons 10 Lessons in Digital LiteracyDigital VideoThinking Critically through Digital Media BestNik Peachey"},
{"title": "Redacto for Intensive Listening Practice", "date": "Monday 30 September 2019", "text": "One of my first experiences of computer assisted language learning back in the mid 90s was of text reconstruction programmes.My students would go to the computer room and spend ages trying to reconstruct a text they had studied, gradually typing in the missing words until the text was complete.I always thought this was great practice for them and could see that they really enjoyed it, so it’s great to see Redacto has combined these text reconstruction activities with authentic audio to build a really useful suite of learning materials.How it WorksThe site has a range of different subjects that students can choose from. Once they have selected the topic they have a range of article to choose from. These are graded according to the CEFR scale.Once they select an article students can click on the play button to start listening.They then type any of the words they hear into the field at the bottom. The words will then appear in the text.It’s not necessary to type the words in the order they appear in the text and, for example, if students type in the word ‘and’ this word will appear anywhere in the text where it occurs, so these aren’t just dictation exercises. If the student is using Google Chrome (recommended), and they have a microphone connected to their computer, they can click on the mic icon and say the word(s), these will then appear in the text search box.Students can listen again as many times as they wish and can even slow the audio down if it helps them to listen for difficult words. In addition, they can click on the gapped word to get a hint, or to see the entire word.All the time the students are working their score and the time taken is also being collected.Once they have completed the transcript, there are follow up activities to consolidate the language they have listened to. There are also further vocabulary flash cards to revise.PremiumRedacto also offers premium tools for schools, including a results tracker, and  a classroom mode where teachers can select activities for students and send them a pin. The students then log in using the pin and a name and they have a simple multiple choice clicker so that they can respond to exercises, in a style similar to Kahoot! These are mainly based on much shorter audio clips and students have to count the number of words or listen to see which words are included in the text.Redacto looks like a great free tool for students who want to develop their listening skills and learn from authentic materials.You can find links to many more tools like this and activities for the digital classroom in my ebooks at: https://payhip.com/peacheypublicationsTo sign up for my free newsletter and get a free copy of Digital Tools for Teachers go to: http://eepurl.com/dtgL79Check Out My Books:Hacking Creativity10 Short Image Lessons 10 Lessons in Digital LiteracyDigital VideoThinking Critically through Digital Media BestNik Peachey"},
{"title": "Using QR Codes to Deliver more Effective Feedback", "date": "Monday 30 September 2019", "text": "We all (I hope) know how important feedback is to students as part of their learning. Often though the people who understand this least are the students themselves and they can find it easy to overlook or disregard feedback as soon as they have seen their grade.Qwiqr seems like a very good solution to that problem and is a great way to get students to take notice and follow up on feedback.How it worksQwiqr uses QR codes that you can attach to homework that provide digital feedback for students that they can access through their phone. This feedback can be written, audio recorded or can come in the form of a web link or video.  Students just scan the code with their phone and they’ll instantly be able to access your feedback. This is an ideal system for language learning as the audio element enables you to provide models of pronunciation, target language and new vocabulary that students can listen to repeatedly.Using Qwiqr you can even make feedback an interactive process and students can record a reply to your message and send it back to you.Qwiqr is very safe for students, as only someone with the QR code can access the recordings.To create your Qwiqr  QR codes you simply print and select the number of QR code stickers you want and then just print them off (using sticky paper will work best).Then when you want to give some feedback, you scan the code with any scanner and then record and save your message. This will store the message on the Qwiqr server. Then you just give students the same QR code and they can scan it and access their feedback and review it at any time.Qwiqr doesn’t require that students download a specific app and work in the browser with any QR code scanner. This is a really great way to get your students really engaging with their feedback and to create a dialogue around their work so that they can check their understanding of anything they got wrong or still need to know.PricingOn the free account you can send audio, image, text or links as feedback and the feedback stays on the server for up to 3 months.If you like it and find it works with your students you can upgrade to premium for just £1.50 a month (that’s about $2) and this will enable you to send video feedback and your students will be able to reply and your feedback will be editable, reusable and on the server forever.Personally, I think this is a great way to get students to really take notice and engage with their feedback. If you have a collection of code stickers ready in the classroom you could also be recording individual feedback for students while you monitor their speaking activities or you could record an overall summary for the end of the lesson that all students could scan.Qwiqr isn’t limited to being used only for feedback though. These are some other suggestions.Record video of pupils talking about their work and put the QR next to the work on display boards.Record spoken conversations that students can listen to at home.Create treasure hunts using images and videos that give clues for students to follow.Create ‘praise cards’ and let students take them home to play for parentsThis is a really great tool and I hope you enjoy it and can use it with your students.You can find links to many more tools like this and activities for the digital classroom in my ebooks at: https://payhip.com/peacheypublicationsTo sign up for my free newsletter and get a free copy of Digital Tools for Teachers go to: http://eepurl.com/dtgL79Check Out My Books:Hacking Creativity10 Short Image Lessons 10 Lessons in Digital LiteracyDigital VideoThinking Critically through Digital Media BestNik Peachey"},
{"title": "EDIA Papyrus - A Tool for Materials Writers and Publishers", "date": "Wednesday 25 September 2019", "text": "As a materials writer, editor and publisher, I’m constantly looking for tools that will save time, increase quality, and make my life easier. One of the best of these I’ve found recently is EDIA Papyrus.How it works EDIA Papyrus is a very simple to use tool that analyses the level of any text I write against a target level and shows me how close to my target level the text is.More than that, it can show me which words will be difficult for the level and if I click on the words it will offer me some substitute words and show me what level those words are.The tool is based around analysing text in relation to the CEFR, so it’s great for TESOL and TEFL teachers who want to create their own materials and professional materials writers, but it can also cross reference to a range of other measures, so almost anyone who writes educational text should find this useful.It is possible to write directly into the EDIA Papyrus interface, but I tend to copy paste between my own documents and EDIA Papyrus as at present there is no way for free users to save their documents there.PricingEDIA Papyrus is a free tool for any individual teacher, but there is an API for any publisher or content production company. This is really useful if you use a number of writers and you want to help support them and standardise the level of their content across a product.The API can plug into a number of different tools such as MS Word or Google Docs and this enables writers to check the level and change vocabulary and sentence length as they type rather than having to go to the EDIA Papyrus site to do it.The API is based around a per-text costing and if you are interested in finding out more about the API it’s best to contact: walter [at] edia.nl I have to say, I’m becoming a regular user these days, as it is a quick way to check the level of a complete text and get a really good understanding of how I need to change it.I hope you find it useful too.You can find links to many more tools like this and activities for the digital classroom in my ebooks at: https://payhip.com/peacheypublicationsTo sign up for my free newsletter and get a free copy of Digital Tools for Teachers go to: http://eepurl.com/dtgL79Check Out My Books:Hacking Creativity10 Short Image Lessons 10 Lessons in Digital LiteracyDigital VideoThinking Critically through Digital Media BestNik Peachey"},

{"title": "The Virtual Writing Tutor - A Suite of Tools for Developing Students’ Writing", "date": "Tuesday 17 September 2019", "text": "For tech-savvy students there are many ways to get their grammar checked, from online grammar checkers to the inbuilt grammar checks that they can find in MS Word or Apple’s Pages, so in order for another grammar checker to be useful, it needs to do more than just check grammar, and that’s what the Virtual Writing Tutor offers.The Virtual Writing Tutor is more than a simple grammar checker, it is a suite of tools and activities that you can use with your students to help them improve their writing.On the home page, there is a standard field where students can enter their text and get the usual kinds of feedback and analysis, such as word counts, vocabulary checks and punctuation checks.When the students click on grammar check, they get a list of their errors with explanations. They can also get the explanations translated if they are lower levels.Another nice feature is that they can actually hear their text spoken using text to speech and even download the audio file, so this is useful for helping to support pronunciation skills too.Across the navigation menu at the top of the site, there are also some interesting features.The Games section has an error correction game that shows students a number of random sentences with errors that they have to correct. Once they have corrected the sentence they click on ‘Help’ and this will give them some feedback on whether they have corrected the sentence.There is also a ‘My error game’ which uses errors from the student’s own texts in the game, so if students are registered users and regularly using the site it also becomes a great way to review and try to eradicate regular errors.Another interesting feature is the IELTS section. In this section, students can practice answering IELTS writing test questions. These tests include a timer so that students are working under test type conditions and when they have finished, they can get some feedback on their answer and an estimated band score.The feedback is informative and tells the students the kinds of words and structure the examiner would be looking for. There is also some grammar feedback on the text the students entered.The Pen Pals section of the site also looks really interesting. Using this, teachers are able to set up and manage their class and using some example templates to manage a range of tasks. The VWT then handles giving the students feedback, correction, and a score, so this is a huge time saver for teachers who want to do this kind of writing exchange.Find out more about this at: A Pen Pal Exchange for Communicative Writing PracticeLast but not least, there is a section of the site for developing Hypertext Narrative. These are the kinds of texts where students read about a situation and then have choices. Their choices can guide their path through the narrative which can have a number of different final outcomes.Using this part of the site teacher or students can easily construct their own hypertext narratives using simple editing tool. You can also access a number of texts that have already been written, so this might be a good place to go to introduce your students to the concept or to find some content for your lessons.Example Hypertext Narratives As with most grammar checkers, The Virtual Writing Tutor looks like it’s still a work in process and the analysis of writing isn’t always going to be perfect, but this looks like a great suite of tools to try out and to keep an eye as there are obviously lots of good ideas here.You can find links to many more tools like this and activities for the digital classroom in my ebooks at: https://payhip.com/peacheypublicationsTo sign up for my free newsletter and get a free copy of Digital Tools for Teachers go to: http://eepurl.com/dtgL79 Check Out My Books:Hacking Creativity10 Short Image Lessons 10 Lessons in Digital LiteracyDigital VideoThinking Critically through Digital Media BestNik Peachey"},
{"title": "TeachVid for Developing Listening Skills", "date": "Wednesday 7 August 2019", "text": "I've always been a huge fan of using video for language development, so I was really delighted when I was sent a link to TeachVid and asked to have a look at it.TeachVid is a really great resource for developing listening skills multiple languages, not just English. The learning is based around short video clips but there are a whole range of different activity types that students can select.The activities use a parallel text technique that combines the use of L1 subtitles with L2 transcription so that students can understand the content they are listening to even if they are quite low level learners.At the most basic level students can watch and listen to the videos with both languages visible, but if they click on 'Activities' this opens a whole range of choices for different ways students can challenge themselves to reconstruct the text.When the students are in activity mode they watch chunks of the video and then reconstruct the text. This could be line by line with the words jumbled up or they may have all the letters and have to find the word boundaries. Once they complete a line the video advances.All the time students are working with the activity their progress is being tracked.There is also a great LMS feature for teachers called 'Classroom'. This allows you to set up assignments for your students and track their progress. You can select a video for an assignment and choose the types and sequence of activities you'd like your students to do. You can even set a due date for the assignment.There are quite a few video resources already on the site, but if you can't find what you are looking for you can also create your own resources using TeachVid's resource creation tools, accessible via the 'My resources' tab on the resources page.TeachVid is based on a freemium business model, so you can register for free as a teacher and create five resources for your students and track their progress. Students can also register independently for free and access any of the featured resources on the site. Registering for a paid account gives you access to many more features and is very reasonably priced. The best deal though is to register as a school. Prices will depend though on the number of student accounts you create.I really recommend TeachVid as a language learning and development tool. I used it to try to improve my Spanish and found the activities really motivating and engaging. This is a great tool to get your students learning independently or in class.You can find links to many more tools like this and activities for the digital classroom in my ebooks at: https://payhip.com/peacheypublicationsSign up for my twice-monthly free newsletter and get a free copy of Digital Tools for Teachers at: https://tinyletter.com/technogogy/Check Out My Books:Hacking Creativity10 Short Image Lessons 10 Lessons in Digital LiteracyDigital VideoThinking Critically through Digital Media BestNik Peachey"},
{"title": "Building Quizzes with Artificial Intelligence", "date": "Tuesday 21 May 2019", "text": "Back in December 2018, I reviewed an excellent web-based application called Quillionz. The site was developed using AI to instantly produce a wide range of questions based on any text of 300 - 3000 words.Since then the tool has been a great success and I've had some very positive reports from many English and subject-based teachers who have used it to save time and create instant reading comprehension tests based around authentic content.Quillionz has now released a Pro version, which I've just tried. I have to say it's really impressive.These are a few of the new features the pro version offers:Generate Wh questionsView the context of a questionGenerate unlimited question sets per daySave unlimited question setsInput content as text and PDFExport question sets as a text file or QuilliQuizThe new feature that I like best is QuilliQuiz. This is a feature that turns the questions into virtual quizzes. Here's an example of a QuilliQuiz abut a newspaper article on Brexit:https://app.quillionz.com/Quiz/Index?id=UIi9wC So once students have read and done their comprehension exercises, you can use this feature to have a group class-quiz or students can use it individually to review and revise the content.They simply look at the questions, try to remember the answer and then click the flashcard to see if they have it right.Quillionz Pro is priced at just under $10 a month, so if you are creating lots of materials based around text then it can be a really economical way to save lots of time.If that is expensive for you, you can still continue to use the free version and quickly create some great quizzes and content for your students.I hope you enjoy using Quillionz with your students.You can find links to many more tools like this and activities for the digital classroom in my ebooks at: https://payhip.com/peacheypublicationsSign up for my twice-monthly free newsletter and get a free copy of Digital Tools for Teachers at: https://tinyletter.com/technogogy/Check Out My Books:Hacking Creativity10 Short Image Lessons 10 Lessons in Digital LiteracyDigital VideoThinking Critically through Digital Media BestNik Peachey"},

{"title": "Bite-Size Teacher Development from Language Fuel ", "date": "Sunday 17 March 2019", "text": "Over the last few weeks, I have been looking through LanguageFuel's online courses for EL teachers.They have a great selection of teacher development courses, around 35 at present, with some really interesting content and a great selection of different topics, that vary from basics like Using Flashcards to more complex issues like Intercultural Awareness.The courses are ideal for short bursts of study on your laptop or mobile as they have been divided into bite-size learning tasks and input. To do a complete course takes between 15 mins and about an hour.The main content is delivered through a mixture of text, interactive activities and animated videos which visually reinforce the concepts being introduced.Many of the courses also include some useful practical tasks that you can try to do with students and some templates for classroom planning or activities.What I particularly liked about the courses was that many of them integrated some digital skills development for teachers and links to useful web-based resources which can help save some time with the day to day business of planning and delivering lessons.These courses are great for novice teachers or to fill in or refresh some knowledge gaps for more experienced teachers.Language Fuel is still at quite an early stage at present so it will be interesting to see how they grow and what else they come up with.You can join their community for free (https://www.languagefuel.com/community-membership) and this also gives you access to their facebook group at: https://www.facebook.com/LanguageFuel/ The courses aren't free, but they are very reasonably priced and one price covers all courses. You can get a free 14 day trial at https://www.languagefuel.com/memberships If you sign up for premium membership you can also get private one to one training through video conference.Language Fuel is a great way to boost your training, especially if you are working in isolated conditions as so many teachers do these days.Sign up for my monthly free newsletter and get more tips and reviews like this one and a free copy of Digital Tools for Teachers at: https://tinyletter.com/technogogy/My Books:20 Tech-Enhanced Activities for the Language Classroom Digital Tools for TeachersThinking Critically through Digital MediaExploiting Infographics10 Lessons in Digital LiteracyDigital Video – A Manual for Language Teachers  BestNik Peachey"},
{"title": "Creating Augmented Reality Experiences with Metaverse", "date": "Friday 8 March 2019", "text": "Three types of technology seem to be creating a lot of interest in educational technology circles at present. These are AI (Artificial intelligence) VR (Virtual Reality) and AR (Augmented Reality).Of the three I feel that AR is the most accessible for teachers and students. This is largely because of apps like Metaverse which enable teachers and students to quickly create enjoyable interactive games and activities that can mesh with their physical location.For those of you who are new to the concept of Augmented Reality, at its most basic, it is the ability to overlay internet-based digital content onto physical locations. This process is usually enabled through a mobile device of some kind and triggered by either location or some form of digital code that your mobile device can scan, like a QR code for example.Metaverse can use either of these techniques, so it enables teachers and students to create either location-specific games and activities or ones that are triggered by scanning a code.The best way to understand what that looks like is to see it in action, so here are two VR experiences I created.This first one is a tour of some of my work. You can either watch the video below or use this link to download the app and try it: https://mtvrs.io/LawngreenWigglyNutcrackerThe second is an interaction with my fairy godmother! You can either watch the video below or use this link to download the app and try it: https://mtvrs.io/AngelicMagentaOcelotCreating experiences like these for students is quite simple and there are lots of different types of interactions and characters you can choose from to build your AR experience.Building involves selecting different types of interaction, adding images and buttons and connecting them together. There are some useful tutorials built into the platform to guide you along each step of the way.Then when you have finished building your experience you can easily test it and publish it.Then it's just a case of making sure your students have the app installed on their devices and pointing them at the QR code.To make experiences location specific, be sure to click on the advanced settings when publishing and this allows you to put the experience into a group and add a GPS location for the group. This will mean that your experience is only available to students who are close to the location you specify. When using this feature with students you'll need to make sure the Metaverse app has access to their location through their phone.This is a great tool for creating interactive engaging content with your students. It's especially great if you are taking students outside the classroom on field trips or if you just want them to explore their locale in their own time to do location-based homework assignments.If you want to get your students creating their own AR experiences you can also use a new feature called 'Collections' this enables you to view, edit and manage your students' creations in one place.Here's a video explaining how this happens.I've really enjoyed using Metaverse and I'm sure I'll be using it a lot more. I also feel that I've only just begun to scape the surface of what it can do, so I'm looking forward to understanding more of the interactions and creating more innovative learning experiences.You can find more tools like this in my article 'Getting into Virtual Reality Part 1: Creating Virtual Reality Worlds' and lots more tools and tips for training teachers in my ebook 'Digital Tools for Teachers - Trainers' Edition'.Sign up for my twice-monthly free newsletter and get a free copy of Digital Tools for Teachers at: https://tinyletter.com/technogogy/My Books:20 Tech Enhanced Activities for the Language Classroom Digital Tools for TeachersThinking Critically through Digital MediaExploiting Infographics10 Lessons in Digital LiteracyDigital Video – A Manual for Language Teachers  BestNik Peachey"},
{"title": "Creating Student Engagement with Acadly", "date": "Monday 14 January 2019", "text": "There's a common quote that is often attributed to Woody Allen with various percentages, but basically, it goes like this, \"Succeeding in life is 80% about showing up\".Although we might debate what the percentage needed to succeed, in eduction not showing up to class is one of the quickest ways to ensure failure.But with many school and university classrooms getting larger, how do we ensure that students are turning up, being engaged and how do we know if they are learning?The simple answer to all these questions is Acadly.Acadly is a simple application that helps professors record attendance at the tap of a button, deliver engaging lectures and track what and how students are learning. Acadly does this by a simple combination of web-based platform and mobile apps for either iOS or Android.To get started the teacher needs to set up their class schedule using Acadly's web-based application or mobile app and add their students' details. Then when students download the free app and register they will automatically be enrolled in the teacher's class. Then when they attend the class the teacher can tap a single button on their app and using mesh technology an attendance beacon will bounce around the students' mobile devices and track who is present. This all happens within seconds.Other in-class features of the app include live polls and quizzes, student-led Q&A quizzes and the delivery of a range of digital materials and files as well as rewarding verbal or spoken student participation. In fact, Acadly enables you to run your classes completely paperless through your students' mobile devices if you choose.The great thing about running the materials and interaction through the app is that it enables the teacher to track student scores and their engagement with the materials. Students can also access their own data so they also know how well they are doing and what they have missed from previous classes.Teachers can also set homework through the app and add links to recommended reading text and videos.Acadly also has a chat feature which you can use as a backchannel, so if there are extra links or materials you’d like to share with your students during the class you can simply pass them through the chat and students can open them on their mobile device. You can also type mathematical equations, if necessary, using a built-in LaTeX editor. And what better way to ensure that students aren't busy being distracted by Facebook than by keeping their phones busy working with course materials?The other great thing about Acadly is that it is free for higher education professors and students, so it's easy to get started immediately with a fully featured version and there is no advertising. The company does have a business model though and they offer paid subscriptions to universities and help them integrate Acadly into their existing IT infrastructure, so attendance and learning data can be tracked across the whole of the institution. Acadly is already in use across California State University, CUNY, IIT Bombay and many more.I think this is a really great tool and with a great approach to balancing enabling individual teachers and supporting its business through university subscriptions. I hope they soon start rolling this model out to other types of schools. I'm sure the attendance feature would have some huge benefits for schools and universities that need to track overseas student attendance for visa purposes, like those in the UK.I hope you find Acadly useful.You can find links to many more tools like this and activities for the digital classroom in my ebooks at: https://payhip.com/peacheypublicationsSign up for my twice-monthly free newsletter and get a free copy of Digital Tools for Teachers at: https://tinyletter.com/technogogy/My Books:Digital Tools for Teachers - Teacher Trainer's Edition Thinking Critically through Digital MediaExploiting Infographics10 Lessons in Digital LiteracyDigital Video – A Manual for Language Teachers  BestNik Peachey"},

Basically, what Epigrammar does is enable you to create classes for your students where you or they can upload their homework assignments and you can add comments to them. That doesn’t sound so unusual, but Epigrammar can also allow you to create a bank of comments that you can reuse so that you aren’t having to write the same thing over.Another great feature of Epigrammar is that it isn’t restricted to text type documents, so if your student has done their homework on paper or even if their homework is a sketch or painting, you or they can take a picture of it, upload it to the platform and then you can add comments and marks.Another nice feature of Epigrammar is that you can make some assignments ‘shared’ so that students can see what their peers have uploaded and even add their own comments and suggestions.The other great time saver though is that at the end of the term or semester when it’s time to write up a report about your students’ work, Epigrammar can automatically generate suggestions for these based on the comments you have made on their written work. Then all you have to do is drag and drop in the ones you want to use and edit them.To get started, you just need to register and then set up a homeroom. Once your homeroom is created you can generate an invitation code and students can then use this to register on the site. This code adds them to your class.You can then either share documents for them to comment on, or they can upload their work to the site for you or their peers to comment on.Comments are added by dropping coloured pins on the document and then writing in and saving to the right of the screen.All of these comments then become visible to the student(s) on the left of the screen.Here’s a link to a video tutorial that goes into more depth on the process of generating reports: https://epigrammar-1.wistia.com/medias/xrw1lvexa7 It’s clear that the more you use Epigrammar the more time it is likely to save you and the more efficient the whole process will become. A bonus feature of the site is that you and your students will also be creating a form of e-portfolio that will enable you and students to look back over their work and assess progress.Epigrammar has a free subscription which should enable you to test it out with a group of students, but to be useable at scale you will need to subscribe. The price though seems very reasonable when comparing to the value of your time and the amount of it you are likely to save by using the platform for all your marking.I hope you and your students enjoy using Epigrammar and that it doesn't just save you time, but also increases the overall impact of your marking.You can find more tools like this and advice on how to train teacher to use them in my ebook.Buy NowI hope you find it useful.BestNik Peachey"},

{"title": "Cikumas - A Free LMS Designed By Students", "date": "Tuesday 6 February 2018", "text": "We spend a lot of time researching and talking about what teachers need from technology but we often forget that our students, who spend the years of their education watching various teachers struggling to get to grips with technology, have a unique insight in to what works for them and where things are going wrong. That’s why it’s great to see Cikumas, an LMS created by two students to produce the kind of classroom environment and activities they want as part of their learning process.Alexander Degenhardt and Noah Liebherr, developed Cikumas due to the frustrations they felt in their classroom. Although they experienced multiple online solutions as learners, they didn’t feel that these catered to the needs of students, so they took the opportunity to create their own solution.How to use CikumasCikumas is a very clean and easy to use LMS that allows teachers to create media rich  interactive content, distribute it to their students either in class or for homework and then monitor their results and responses.Unlike many other LMS such as Moodle, the learning curve for Cikumas is pretty gentle and once you log in you should be able to create some interactive content for your students pretty quickly.When you first log in to Cikumas you go straight to the dashboard. Here you can see any active assignments that your students are working on as well as your calendar and your personal to-do list.To start creating content and courses for your students just click on the ‘Library’ icon. This is where you will be able to store and curate all of your lesson activities and materials.To create a lesson or activity just click on ‘Add New,' then give your activity a name, choose the topic area and add a description. You can come back and change these later if you need to.Now you can add four types of content to your lesson. These are Text, Question, Media or File.The text blocks have a simple to use editor that allows you to format any text content and add images and hyperlinks to external content.Media allows you to add the usual video, image or audio files, but also mathematics equations. When adding media you can do this either from your computer, your Google Drive or from online sources such as YouTube, or in the case of images, through a Google search. You will need to allow access to your Google account to do this though.Adding files is equally as simple and you just drag and drop any file types you want student to access and they will be uploaded.Where Cikumas starts to get really interesting though is when you start adding question types.There are four main types of question you can add.Mutiple choice - These are the usual single select, multiple select, yes/no and true/false types. To create one of these questions you just click on the type you want and then add you question and answer options. You can also select how many points the students are awarded for a correct answer.Fill in the blanks - There are two kinds of blank filling question types. You can choose to create a text with gaps the students have to type into or you can select which words are extracted from the text and then students drag the words back in to the spaces. Classify - There are two types of classification question types. You can either get students to drag and drop text labels to images or they can order parts of a text.Free response - There are two types of free response. You can either get students to type an answer into an open field or they can record and audio response.These interactive question types are ideal for language learners and teachers and enable you to quickly create very professional interactive content.Once you have created your lessons and activities, you can go to ‘My Classes’ and create your classes and invite students to them.The ‘My Classes’ part of the site is where you will come to monitor your students results and grade their responses, but there is also a class wall where you can make announcements to the class  and post and share interesting materials. This can help to keep students engaged with a wider range ad-hoc learning materials and keep them up-to-date on any course changes or assignments.Even as an experienced Moodle developer, I found that creating materials within Cikumas was much quicker and simpler. It doesn’t have the level of customisation that a platform like Moodle has, but for teachers who just want to get straight down to creating learning materials it’s a much simpler and more direct route to creating motivating learning that looks really professional and is easy to manage for both teachers and students.I hope you enjoy using Cikumas for your students and that it helps you to save some time and deliver interactive classroom and homework assignments.My Books:20 Tech Enhanced Activities for the Language Classroom Digital Tools for TeachersThinking Critically through Digital MediaExploiting Infographics10 Lessons in Digital LiteracyDigital Video – A Manual for Language Teachers  BestNik Peachey"},

{"title": "Getting into Virtual Reality Part 1: Creating Virtual Reality Worlds", "date": "Thursday 7 December 2017", "text": "Strangely enough I had my first experience of Virtual Reality in a bar in Barcelona about twenty years ago. As I remember I put on a headset and then had to jump from one rock to another as I navigated my way through what looked like some kind of virtual meteor shower.About ten years later I had an office in the 3D Second Life virtual world and was designing business English classes and running an ELT chat show. Now another ten years on VR seems to be making another surge into the mainstream consumer market and the field of education. Whether it’s here to stay or not largely depends on how accessible edtech companies can make this to mainstream teachers and classrooms around the world and the ability of edtech companies to provide experiences that have genuine educational outcomes that match the kind of investment that will be necessary to enable students to access those experiences.Google have made a great start with Cardboard (a cheap and easy to assemble VR headset that can be used with a mobile phone) but Cardboard is still a long way from being able to provide the kinds of immersive and interactive experiences that come with the much more expensive Vive and Oculus type devices.Anyway, in an effort to help you navigate and get involved with this new wave of virtual reality I’ll be writing a short series on what’s out there and available for teachers and educationalists to get started with, so here are the first six tools for creating VR experiences.EdorbleEdorble is a great tool for setting up your own 3D virtual classroom. You and your students have to download the software and then you get a code to enter your own virtual world. Give the code to your students and they can enter your virtual world too. This gives you and island auditorium where you can show videos, collaboratively share and view links to websites and chat using proximity sensitive voice  chat.You and your students can also roam around and explore the rest of the environment. There is also a version for VR headsets.https://www.edorble.com/ RumiiRummi is a 3D virtual meeting space for meetings of various sizes. You need to create an account and download the free software. You can then create your avatar and create various size rooms depending on how big your meeting is.These rooms vary from small meeting rooms to larger auditoriums that can host panel type debates with a group of speakers and a larger audience watching. You can use this with an ordinary laptop or desktop screen or with a VR headset and controller.https://www.rumii.net/landing MirraThis is a wonderful tool for constructing interactive 3D virtual reality spaces. You can register and then either customise a pre-constructed template environment or create your own from scratch. You can add a range of interactive features to the environments such as hot spots that link to other materials or content, video screens, interactive 3D models, 2D texts.Once you have finished building you can publish your environment and allow people to visit and interact with it. This is a great way to build VR experiences that can be viewed in the web browser either with a standard screen or VR headset.https://mirra.co/home/overviewCo SpacesThis is a great resources for getting kids to create their own interactive 3D  spaces and creations. If you register as a teacher you can create classes and assignments then add your students to the class and set them the assignments. Students get a code to enter your class and can then create virtual spaces. Check out some of the examples to get some idea of what is possible.Pirate ship: https://maker.cospaces.io/Universe/Space/GMbbXZ0LZ33Ca7aw9p3VjW Students can browse or create these using a standard screen or VR headset.https://cospaces.io/ SansarSansar is only recommended for those who want to dedicate really serious time into developing the VR building skills. It was created by the Second Life company, Linden Lab, and is still in beta. It enables you to build a complete 3D virtual world that multiple users can join using either VR headsets or computer screen. You’ll need a PC to download the software to do this, but it is free. They have also provided a large amount of training material and resources for anyone who wants to skill up at creating virtual reality worlds in Sansar: https://atlas.sansar.com/ You can also see some great examples of the worlds people are creating (To visit them you’ll also need to download the software though). Here are a few:Floating Temple: https://atlas.sansar.com/experiences/c3rb3rus/floating-temple-wip Ink: https://atlas.sansar.com/experiences/johnbaic/ink An Evening at the Ballet: https://atlas.sansar.com/experiences/brynoh/an-evening-at-the-ballet https://sansar.com/  Engage Immersive EducationEngage is also for those who want to take their VR pretty seriously and create virtual reality educational experiences. The Engage platform is a free to use social education and presentation platform. Engage allows you to hold meetings, classes, private lessons and presentations with people from all around the world in a safe virtual multi user environment. Like Sansar the software is free to download (You’ll need a high spec PC though) and with it you get all the tools you need to build virtual world experiences. Engage was really designed for the virtual delivery of live and recorded presentations and experiential distance learning for up to 30 students in a class.

{"title": "Build Speaking & Pronunciation Tasks into your Moodle Course", "date": "Thursday 23 November 2017", "text": "SpeechAce is a great Moodle plugin for anyone who wants to build speaking and pronunciation activities into their online course.The plugin allows you to build tasks and activities into your Moodle course that require a verbal response, these can be listen and answer, listen and repeat, watch multimedia and answer,  and which gives students useful constructive feedback on their pronunciation.Students simply click to record their answers or input, this can be the answer to a questions or can be based around a text they have read or a recorded model (UK or US accent) they have listened to and tried to imitate.They then they get a score and an analysis of their answer. They can get word by word feedback on their performance and see which phonemes they produced successfully and which they still need to work on.Installing the plugin is pretty simple and then you just select it from the main tasks menu whenever you want to add a speaking activity to your course.If you build it into a tutored course the students scores are recorded in the grade book and teachers can go and listen to their recordings too. This can really make teaching preparation effective in a blended learning course.Like many teachers and language course designers, I’m usually pretty sceptical about a computers’ ability to evaluate student speaking, especially given the range of variation in native speaker output, but I think SpeechAce does a really good job of getting students to produce language, giving them feedback on their performance and encouraging them to listen and try again. Building this kind of capability into an online language course, especially a MOOC type one that has much less teacher contact, could really help students to stay motivated and engaged for longer.  Video demoIf you want to give it a try as a teacher then go to: https://playground.speechace.com/moodle/ where you can get access to the SpeechAce sandpit.If you want to try it as a student then go to: www.speechace.com/pc and you can try a demo placement test. I’ve known about SpeechAce for a couple of years now and it’s great to see how it has developed. It isn’t free (there is a free trial), but the company is clearly putting their money into developing a constantly improving product and I think that’s something worth supporting.You can find 100 + more tools and resources like this in my ebook Digital Tools for Teachers - Second Edition or if you want to train other teachers to use these kinds of tools check out the Teacher Trainers’ Edition.My Books:20 Tech Enhanced Activities for the Language Classroom Digital Tools for TeachersThinking Critically through Digital MediaExploiting Infographics10 Lessons in Digital LiteracyDigital Video – A Manual for Language Teachers  BestNik Peachey"},
{"title": "Making your Classroom Paperless and Media Rich with Unio", "date": "Wednesday 15 November 2017", "text": "Unio is a great tool if you want to ditch your course book and make your lessons paperless and media rich.It’s a very easy tool to use. You can set up courses just by clicking on the cross in the top right of screen.Once you have created your course topic, adding and editing lessons is simple.Once the editor is open you can upload ready made presentations in multiple formats and add interactivity to them or create the lesson by adding individual elements and interactive learning objects.Once the lesson is created Unio is really simple to use. You just launch the live session and any student can then log in to the lesson with just their name and the class code.Unio works in the web browser so will run on any device regardless of the operating system, so it’s ideal for the BYOD classroom.Once students have the lesson open on their device they can use the tools to annotate it, answer polls, watch videos or if they have questions they can send them in to the teacher.As the teacher you can control which slide they are seeing or you can ‘unsync’ the presentation and allow them to browse. When the presentation is ‘unsynced’ students can watch any video or media clips independently on their own devices rather than collectively on your main presentation screen. This is great if you want students to watch or listen at their own pace.When you finish a live lesson you can leave it open for students to browse and work through independently, so there is potential to use this for a flipped learning approach too, or you can use it for 100% online classes instead of screen sharing (and save a lot of bandwidth). Unio is a freemium product, but the free version is very usable and the if you want to upgrade and use this at a school level then it’s still very reasonably priced. Unio is still in its early days and the company is very keen to work with schools and educators to develop the product. You can find out more about that here: https://uniobyharness.com/about Unio has huge potential for the digital classroom and is a great way to keep devices, fingers and minds occupied and working in a constructive way.I hope you enjoy using Unio and your students find it rewarding.

Just set up your topic, add an image and some explainer text that you want students to read first and then invite students to add either pros or cons.You can keep your debate topics private and only allow your own students to add to them by creating teams and then sharing different discussions with the team, or once you have 15 comments you can then publish them and open them up to the public. This process of collecting a reasonable number of comments before going public helps to ensure the quality and integrity of the discussion content already on the site.Once you have created a team you can also share any of the existing debates with your students too.This is a great place to get your students thinking in a structured and logical way about complex topics and is a great way to prepare them for a classroom debate or discussion.The discussions have been categorised into topics to make them easier to browse. A lot of the existing content has a very strong US bias, but there are still quite a few internationally relevant topics if you don’t want to create your own.I hope you enjoy using Kialo and your students find it rewarding.  You can find over 100 digital lesson plans, videos and teacher resources in my Teachers' Classroom App GET IT TODAY BestNik Peachey"},

Peergrade is a great tool to get students assessing each others’ work and giving each other feedback.Read more 4. Writing & Discussion Activities to Promote Awareness of Fake NewsNewspaper Generator is a useful tool that enables you to create what looks like a newspaper front page.

{"title": "Creativity, Global Issues and the English Language Classroom", "date": "Wednesday 11 October 2017", "text": "It’s been gratifying over the last few months to see an increase in interest in the role of creativity in learning and particularly language learning, so I thought I’d share some of the work I’ve been doing with Alan Maley on behalf of the British Council and hope to encourage a few more teachers to get involved with the C Group. I was really glad to see the culmination of over a years’ work come to fruition with the publication of Integrating global issues in the creative English language classroom. This is book is now available as a free download from the British Council site. The book focuses on the development of a deeper understanding of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals for 2030 and explores creative ways teachers can raise awareness of and promote these goals among our students.  This is a book I co-edited with Alan and also wrote a chapter for and which I presented in a live webinar on October 5th for Teachers’ Day.   Integrating global issues in the creative English language classroom  from Nik Peachey The book was a follow on from our earlier volume Creativity in the English language classroom - also published for free by the British Council back in 2015. This is where the C Group comes in as the first book would probably never have existed if it hadn’t been for the work of Alan Maley in bringing together a group of teachers and authors all of whom shared a similar concern regarding an increasing orientation in teaching towards tests and certificates.The C Group first met in Harrogate in 2014 and it was out of that first meeting and with the support of the membership that we were able to put together a proposal for the book.Since then the C Group has grown considerably so it’s something that I would like to encourage more teachers to get involved with.If you are interested in finding out more about the C Group please visit their website or Facebook page.If you have work related to creativity in ELT that you want to circulate through social media or what to track what others are sharing please use the hanshtag  #cre8I hope you enjoy these books and they help to spark your own creativity.My eBooks:20 Tech Enhanced Activities for the Language Classroom Digital Tools for TeachersThinking Critically through Digital MediaExploiting Infographics10 Lessons in Digital LiteracyDigital Video – A Manual for Language Teachers BestNik Peachey"},

The next writer then adds a sentence and either passes it back or passes it to another student. The process continues until the story is finished.In this app version users create an account and then write the introduction to the story. You can add links to images in the introduction phase too, so this can help inspire other writers. Once the introduction is create you can either make it public, share it through social mediaor share it with selective people.The app works both synchronously and asynchronously and has a text chat window on the side of the interface so students can interact with each other as they build the story.The app works in the browser so it will run on a laptop or mobile device.

Once installed, you can open a document in Google Docs and then decide what aspects of your writing you would like to improve.The add-on opens in the sidebar of the document, and you can select from a number of aspects that you would like to work on. Select from the menu, and you will see a sub menu that has more specific features to choose from. When you click on one of the features, you will see the places in your document where improvements could be made and get a list of them in the sidebar. You can then decide which sentences are okay and which you would like to improve.You can also get some advice and explanation of the feature to find out how it impacts on your writing. This is a marvellous tool which I intend to start using myself. It doesn't do the work for the students like a grammar or spell-checker, but it does push them to think about their writing at a more stylistic level. It's probably more suited to higher level learners and particularly good for anyone working on EAP or studying for an IELTS or similar exam. SAS Writing Reviser is a great tool for anyone using Google Docs.

There's also quite a lot of background information on the site which would make for useful and motivating reading before the students play.The game itself is really nicely designed. Students enter a basic training simulator where two game characters take them through the basics of creating their avatar and learning how to move around. They are then launched into the alien world which they can explore using a map to guide them. They have a number of tasks to complete as they explore the world and meet other students.The interface is nicely designed and easy to use and students start to collect a number of tools and samples to help with the tasks.The software is being updated very regularly at present so if you get students to do this it's probably better for them to work on it at home on their own computer. You can use elements of the website in the classroom and get them students sharing experiences and impressions in the classroom as speaking activities.Tyto is a great gaming tool to get students actively using their English. It's rated as being suitable for ages 9 years + and  students will need a low intermediate level (B2) or better to understand what's happening.I hope you and your students enjoy this great free online game.

The tool works as a plug in with a range of platforms including Moodle, Drupal and Wordpress (all of which have free versions available) .It’s very easy to install the plug in (took me less than 5 mins with Wordpress) and once this is done  you can choose any of the interactive elements to add to your pages.The activities the plug in produces are html5 so they will run equally well on both desktop and mobile platforms. Many of the activity types are also ideal for language learning and the development of multimedia content.There are great tools for creating interactive video based quizzes, presentations, audio responses, a variety of games and text manipulation activities.If you look at the content types here you’ll see examples of each one as well as some information about how to use them.For such a powerful tool, the learning curve on creating the activities is quite gentle and you should be able to start producing content quite quickly. H5P is open source and there is a good community of developers sharing expertise on the support forums if you get stuck.

It is a Chrome plugin that converts a computer into a kind of language lab.If you sign up as a teacher you can then assign texts to students and they can record themselves reading the text and send it to you for feedback.You see all your students’ submissions in the LMS and you can the listen to them and send them feedback.This is a great way to make reading aloud less stressful and more productive for students. They will have the time to read and understand the text before recording it (there are comprehension questions with each of the prepared texts) and they will have the opportunity to listen to themselves and improve their recording.This enables you to give students speaking practice for homework and it gives you the opportunity to listen to each individual student and analyse their pronunciation problems.You do both need to have Google Chrome though and students will need to register with an email address.I hope you find Fluency Tutor useful.

{"title": "Using Computer Games to Raise Global Issues", "date": "Wednesday 9 August 2017", "text": "Computer games are increasingly making their way into the field of education these days and for good reason. They are part of our students' lives They can be deeply engaging to the point of addictionThey can be a creative genre of communication through narrativeSo in this post I'd like to introduce a few games that you can use with students as a springboard for discussion on what can be some difficult issues for teachers to address in the classroom.The Coming Out SimulatorThis is an interactive story type game that is played on a simulation of a phone screen. The students watch SMS messages appear and follow the story. Students can work through the story and gain some valuable insights into what it’s like to be a gay teenager and to ‘come out’.This could be really useful content to get students talking, thinking and writing about a topic that many teachers find difficult to deal with in the classroom.We Become What We Behold This is a short game that attempts to raise awareness of how the media highlights certain behaviours and attitudes that reinforce prejudices that can then lead to violence. The students play the role of a photographer, taking photograph and trying to spot things that are interesting. As they snap the pictures they see people’s reaction and gradually manipulate the reactions of the people they are photographing.This is a great game to lead in to discussion or writing tasks on the topic of media manipulation and prejudice.Lilya - The Shadows of WarThis is a free game built for iOS or Android around the experience of a Palestinian family during the 2014 war in Gaza. It has won multiple awards from around the world. It does a lot to counteract the usual glamour attached to war related games and is a mixture of game play, digital narrative and art experience. It tells the story of a small family and their struggle for day to day survival. The game contains a strong emotional message, so you should be careful about using it with particularly young learners.Read moreGames for ChangeYou can find lots more free and commercial games like this on the Games for Change website.

{"title": "An App for Making Grammar Addictive", "date": "Friday 19 May 2017", "text": "The ‘Quiz Your English App’ is a great new free app available for on both iOS and Android that has been designed to make English learning and revision into an engaging, enjoyable and addictive game.The app has been produced by Cambridge English Language Assessment and can be downloaded for free from: http://www.cambridgeenglish.org/learning-english/games-social/quiz-your-english/ Once your students have installed the game they need to register either by using a Google or Facebook account. Once registered students can challenge other users in competitive language quizzes. They do this by clicking on ‘Play’ and then choosing a topic.Once they have their topic, the app will match them up to an opponent and they then have to answer a sequence of five timed questions.The students then have ten seconds to answer the question. The student that answers correctly first scores more points.The whole quiz is finished in less than 1 minute and then the students can ask for a rematch or challenge someone else.As the students gain points they are added to a scoreboard and they can search through the scoreboard and challenge other players.By clicking on ‘Results’ students can review their past games, see how they scored and look at which questions they got right or wrong.This is a really simple but very well designed app that will keep students at a lower intermediate + level engaged with and reviewing language on a regular basis.Using Quiz Your English with StudentsIt would be a great tool to use as a filler in the classroom for students who finish early or for some autonomous learning tool.You could also start your class by getting students into pairs or small groups to share the questions they got wrong and work together to try to find  out why their answer was wrong and which one was correct.Summary There’s a lot to like about this app. I actually really enjoyed playing it myself as a native speaker, so for students who are drawn to competitive games this could be quite addictive.I also like that you know who you are playing against and where they come from, even though the app doesn’t enable any form of contact, so it’s still safe for students.The fact that the quizzes are so short also keeps the interest levels and students can quickly go to reviewing their answers or play another opponent.There is of course a commercial element to the app and there are in-app purchases so that students can buy particular quiz packs, including one for IELTS, but this could be a really good way for students to do some enjoyable revision and improve their score.I have some reservations about having to register using my Facebook or Google account. This is great in that it reduces the chances of students forgetting or losing passwords and automatically creates their profile and enables them to challenge other friends on Facebook, but it would be nice to have a log in option for students who aren’t Google or Facebook users or ones that prefer to opt out.On the whole I think Quiz Your English is a great app and can add a really useful dimension to your students’ learning and your classroom teaching. I hope you and your students enjoy using it.You can find links to many more tools like this and activities for the digital classroom in my ebooks at: https://peacheypublications.com/.

The teaching ideas and activities themselves are ones that I have adapted from my pre-technology teaching days, so they are all built on sound classroom teaching practice.The activities are ideal for the modern connected classroom in which students come to class with a variety of devices, but they can also be used in a blended context and students can be assigned some parts of the tasks to do outside of the classroom.I have also included a collection of 8 video tutorials to help less tech confident teachers deal with the technology side of using the materials.I hope 20 Tech Enhanced Activities for the Language Classroom will act as a bridge for teachers who are newer or less confident at using digital tools and materials and help them provide engaging and motivating language learning experiences for their students.I hope you find this ebook useful.Related linksDigital Tools for TeachersThinking Critically through Digital Media Exploiting InfographicsDigital Video – A Manual for Language Teachers BestNik Peachey"},

{"title": "Tools and alternatives for creating presentations", "date": "Monday 10 October 2016", "text": "Most computers come with some form of preloaded software that includes a package for creating presentations. There are however a range of alternatives and online apps available that have made an attempt to change, update or enhance the presentation format. As well as the standard tools I’ve included a range of alternatives here for you to explore.Microsoft PowerPoint - https://www.microsoftstore.com/  PowerPoint has become a standard tool for creating presentations both in the educational and workplace environments. There are many reasons for sticking with PowerPoint; It’s a very powerful tool, Most students who use Windows PCs will probably already have it installed on their computers; Many web-based platforms work well with it. Despite this, it is worth looking around at other tools, especially if you want to get your presentations online as PPTs are generally big files that don’t export well for online delivery. There are also a lot of free alternative to PowerPoint, many of which give a more flexible approach to creating presentations and are much simpler to learn.Apple KeyNote - http://www.apple.com/uk/mac/keynote/  KeyNote is Apple’s alternative to PowerPoint and for me it’s a much lighter and more user friendly tool. It has a great range of easy to adapt stylish templates. It makes designing the look and feel of the presentation much easier. You can export the presentations to a good range of file types including Microsoft’s PPT format if you need to. I also find that KeyNote deals much more easily with importing image and video media.SlideShare - http://www.slideshare.net/ SlideShare is a free online platform for sharing your presentation slides. This can make your slides much more accessible to others after the presentation. The best way to add your slides to SlideShare is to save them to PDF first and then just upload them. The site makes it very easy to share your presentation through a range of social media and you can also easily add them to your LinkedIn profile.Simpleshow - https://www.mysimpleshow.com Simpleshow is a great alternative to getting students to stand up and do a presentation. Instead it allows students to create a narrated video presentation. This could be used as a great first step towards delivering their own physical presentation. It also offers the students the choice between recording their own narration or using a text to speak generated narration.The site is free and simple to use. Once students register they just need to type their script for each slide and stage in the presentation and then the site will automatically generate images to go with the script. Students can then go through and edit each slide, change the images or add their own narration.At each step their are video guides so there shouldn’t be too many technical challenges. There are also plenty of examples here: https://www.mysimpleshow.com/examples/ so it would be good to choose a couple for students to look at first so they understand what they are going to create.Check out my ebookPrezi - https://prezi.com/ Prezi is very popular among the edtech community at present and claims to represent a shift away from the traditional linear form of presentation. It provides a kind canvas on which you can layout a mixture of assets that you wish to present, such as video clips text and images. You then chart a course around the various assets zooming in and out as you talk through them. Prezi is very mobile friendly too and has a dedicated app for iOS.Movenote - http://movenote.com/  Movenote is another useful alternative for online courses or when you don’t want students to have to deliver physical presentations. It is a free tool that enables students to upload their slide-deck and then add slide by slide talking head narration. The site is very simple to use. Students just upload a PDF version of the presentation and then use  a webcam and microphone to add their narration. Movenote has Android and iOS apps for students with mobile devices too. When the the presentation is recorded it is stored online and students can share links to their presentations.AuthorStream - http://www.authorstream.com/AuthorStream is similar to SlideShare. It’s tool for hosting your presentations online. You can also add audio narration and the site will then convert them to video which you can download, though this is a paid feature so you will have to upgrade from the free version to do that. The site does have a couple of advantages over SlideShare though, especially for KeyNote users. It accepts KeyNote presentations and will retain any animations used in the presentation too. The site does look a bit out of date though and isn’t as well designed as SlideShare. QwikSlides - http://www.classtools.net/qwikslides/ QwikSlides is a very simple browser-based tool for creating online presentations. Basically you can add text, links to online images and videos and customise the look of the presentation a little. It’s not nearly as powerful in terms of design as something like Keynote or PowerPoint, but it does get the job done and the presentation online very quickly and it is free. To get started just click on the edit icon and you can simply type in your text and the links to the media you want to include. Each line in the editor creates a new slide.Tackk - https://tackk.com Tackk is another alternative to doing presentations in the classroom. It allows students to create a single webpage and add different kinds of media and text to the page. The pages are social so other students can either contribute to the page or comment, etc. The pages are also easily shared through social media. The designs look very modern and professional so this is a very motivating way for students to share their work. Students can use the single page to share and display the results of their research and add explainer text.Buncee  - https://www.edu.buncee.com/Buncee is a cross between presentation tool and digital canvas. You can use it to create either a sequence of slides or just use one slide as a kind of digital poster. There is a really wide range of digital assets that students can search through and use in their pages and this includes images, video 360 images as well as designs, animations shapes and text. Buncee also works a little like a social network so that students can follow each other and like and comment on each other’s work. There is also an educational version of Buncee. Buncee is a freemium product so there are some features which are locked without payment (audio recording being the most useful one) but the tool is still very useful even if you just work with the free features.You can find more tools like these in Digital Tools for Teachers I hope you find these useful.Related links:Digital Tools for Teachers 10 Lessons in Digital LiteracyExploiting InfographicsStudying How to Study BestNik Peachey"},
{"title": "Exploiting Infographics for Digital Literacy and Critical Thinking", "date": "Monday 3 October 2016", "text": "This is just a short post to anounce the publication of my new ebook 'Exploiting Infographics for Digital Literacy and Critical Thinking'.Exploiting Infographics follows on from 10 Lessons in Digital Literacy, which is a collection of lesson plans based around infographics, and looks in more depth at the genre and how infographics can be used as both sources of information and as creative learning tasks for students.The tasks that accompany the infographics are intended to encourage students to think more critically about the information they are exposed to and to question the sources of information they find whilst browsing the internet.Exploiting Infographics should help teachers to start creating their own tasks, activities and lesson plans for students and to integrate infographics in a way that will enhance students’ critical thinking, digital literacy, language and communication skills.Exploiting Infographics was conceived as part of The Digital Classrooms Series which started with the award winning Digital Video - A Manual for Language Teachers.The series is intended to help teachers, teacher trainers, materials writers and course designers integrate digital technologies into their classroom practice in a pedagogically sound and impactful way.I hope you enjoy these books and find them useful.Related links:My Lesson Materials Nik Peachey"},
{"title": "Online Grammar Tools", "date": "Wednesday 6 July 2016", "text": "I was recently looking through my Tools for Teacher & Learners site and searching through the accumulated resources there - More than a thousand links.I tend to feel that very few people go beyond what's newest on the front page, so I decided to start grouping the links together and posting them here. This first post features some of the best links to grammar orientated sites.Read MoreDeep GrammarDeep Grammar is a grammar checker based on artificial intelligence. Deep Grammar uses deep learning (artificial neural networks) to learn a model of language. It then uses this model to check text for errors in three steps.  Compute the likelihood that someone would have intended to write the text.  Attempt to generate text that is close to the written text but is more likely.  If such text is found, show it to the user as a possible correction. This page demonstrates a prototype of Deep Grammar. It assumes that text has been spell checked. You can use this to get students checking, correcting and improving their own written work before they submit it.http://www.deepgrammar.com/tryitoutSentence TreeThis is a great site that analyses the grammar of any sentence you type in and tells you the parts of speech of each word within the sentence. Students or trainee teachers can use this to analyse sentences and identify structures.https://foxtype.com/sentence-treeGrammarFlipThis is grammar instruction for the flipped classroom. Lots of video explanations of grammar points with interactive follow up quizzes. There is even an LMS so you can register your students and track them to make sure they do their homework. You can use this to get students learning the grammar at home so that they can spend more time in class doing practice activities and developing their speaking skills. https://grammarflip.com/Grammar GambleThis is a gamified grammar test. Students can gamble amounts of imaginary money depending on how sure they are that they have the right answer. The more they gamble the more points they win, but if they get the answer wrong they loose their money.You can use this to encourage students to revise their grammar in a more entertaining way. There is even a leader board and students can post their scores through Facebook, etc.http://www.grammargamble.com/Verb conjugation toolThis chart enables users to select a common verb and then see the various conjugations of the verb. This is a great tool to help students check their verb conjugations, especially for those at lower levels.http://www.prologo.net/english/Close Test CreatorIf you want to quickly create a close test based on a simple text, just cut and paste it into the main filed and it will take out random words or specific word forms. Great for instant lesson activities. This is a great tool to share with students. Teach them how to use it and they can create their own revisions tests. http://l.georges.online.fr/tools/cloze.htmlHemingway AppThis app will analyse students grammar and make suggestions about how to improve it. The suggestions aren’t always right so students will still need to use their judgement.Like DeepGrammar, this is a great way to get students editing, reviewing and improving their own written work before they submit it to you for marking. http://www.hemingwayapp.com/ Telescopic TextI love this site. Just click on the grey parts of the sentence and watch it extend. This is a great tool for showing students how to develop their writing and make it more interesting by using a range of devices such as clauses, richer adjectives and adverbs and more detail.  You can also create your own sentences using: http://www.telescopictext.org/ Get students to develop their writing skills by starting with a basic simple sentence and taking it in turns to add to the sentence and develop it. See which pair of students can build the longest sentence.http://www.telescopictext.com/  I hope you enjoy these sites and find them useful.

{"title": "10 Lesson Plans to Develop Digital Literacies", "date": "Wednesday 2 March 2016", "text": "Over the last few months I have been working hard to develop a set of commercially available lesson materials. These lesson plans aren't specifically designed for English language learners, though they will be useful for students at higher levels who want stimulating skills based practice or for any teacher interested in developing a CLIL or content based approach to language learning.  They were designed to enable any teacher to develop students in a way that is more closely aligned to the kinds of skills they will need to function effectively and critically in the digital world.  ...I hope you enjoy these lessons and find them useful in developing your students into digitally literate citizens of the 21st century.Related links:Creating illustrations and infographics for ELT tasks Exploiting Infographics for ELT Digital Video - A manual for language teachers Managing the digital classroom - Using a backchannel Managing the digital classroom - Getting students' attention 20 + Things you can do with QR codes in your schoolBrainstorming and polling with AnswerGardenBestNik Peachey"},
{"title": "Why ebooks should be cheaper and how to get my book for free", "date": "Thursday 5 November 2015", "text": "One of the great things about digital publishing is that it enables any individual to distribute their ebooks to an international audience without having to use a physical distribution network.This should enable publishers to deliver digital versions of their books for a fraction of the cost as they don’t have to pay the expensive printing, shipping, storage, redistribution and reseller costs that are necessary to get their paper-based versions of books sold all over the world.As an independent publisher I’ve been able to use digital distribution channels to enable me to sell my ebook way below the price of a physical version of the book and at times, such as International Teachers Day, I’ve been able to give away more than 2000 copies in 24 hours without incurring any cost.My own ebook retails for around the price of a sandwich (Perhaps a little less if you go to Starbucks).Digital Video - A manual for language teachers - on iTunes:  Digital Video - A manual for language teachers - PDF version: One of the big downsides of digital distribution for teacher development books is still payment platforms. In many of the countries where teacher development books are most needed and where publishers could be using ebooks to deliver cut price products for teachers, access to international digital payment platforms is restricted due to either national legislation or lack of  hard currency. This often leaves teachers with no option but to turn to blackmarket sources and support digital piracy.In an effort to counteract this I would like to make my ebook Digital Video - A manual for language teachers freely available to anyone without the means to pay for it who is willing to help me with a little research project.If you would like to download a copy of my ebook and don’t have the means to pay for it please send an email to: nik.peachey (add the @ here) peacheypublications.com In the subject line please write - Digital technologies for teaching researchIn the body of the email please just tell me a about:your teaching contextthe country and type of school you teach in the biggest obstacles you face using technologyhow and why you use or want to use digital technologies to help your students.

{"title": "Detecting plagiarism with Unplag", "date": "Tuesday 30 June 2015", "text": "Plagiarism has become an increasingly significant issue with the increase of online information and the ease with which it can be copied. It is an issue in the classroom for students and educators, but it’s also an issue for writers, bloggers and journalists.Of course plagiarism is nothing new. Students and writers have been copying each others work or copying from books for centuries, but perhaps what is different now is the ease with which you can actually detect plagiarism and identify the original sources of the content.This is where Unplag can help. Unplag is a professional tool for detecting plagiarism. Unplag works in a number of ways. You can use it to create your own library of content built up of student work and then check to see if they are plagiarising from each other.You can use it to search billions of webpages to see if students are plagiarising from the internet.You can run a comparison check between two files to see what similarities there are.When you check a file against the internet for plagiarism you can also generate a report which includes links to the specific pages where the content originated and clicking through to those pages Unplag highlights the precise piece of text that has been plagiarised.Unplag also creates a PDF report that you can download or email to someone else. The report contains statistics about the percentages of content that are similar as well as the links to the original sources. This makes reporting on plagiarism during meetings or tutorials much more effective as you can have the information you need printed up and share a copy with whoever needs to see it.As a writer or blogger Unplag can be incredibly useful to help you protect your intellectual property. After creating each publication you can upload a copy to Unplag and then run regular checks on your texts to find out if and where your content has been taken. Once again, having a PDF report to use can make dealing with content theft that much more effective.You can try Unplag for free, though it will only scan through the first 20% of any document you want to check. If plagiarism is something that is a regular problem you need to deal with then you can subscribe for as little as $4.99 a month.Of course it is possible to run parts of your documents through Google or another search engine to check whether the content is plagiarised, but this isn’t very efficient and can take up a lot of your time, so in the long run, having a service like Unplag can save you both time and money.I found Unplag really quick to register on and very quick and simple to use. Just click the icon to upload your document, then choose the type of check you want. Unplag takes around 4 seconds to check a document and then shows you the report on the sidebar. You click through to the sources and check what they are. Unplag also has the ability to separate out references from the main text content, so this is great for checking academic articles. You can then either click the icon to download the report or you can click on the share icon to email the report to someone else.I hope you find it useful.Related links:Get Students Checking Grammar and Collocation Teaching Grammar Through SongsCrazy Comparatives & SuperlativeCreate Image BooksUsing Word Clouds in EFL ESL4 Similar Tools to WordleCloze Test Creation ToolNik Peachey"},
{"title": "Using the TeamUp calendar to schedule learning", "date": "Saturday 20 June 2015", "text": "One of the greatest challenges to effective study and teaching is organising and managing time efficiently. This becomes even more of a challenge if you want to get your students working in a collaborative way and blending their classroom activity with online activities and projects.This ability to manage work and collaborative interaction is, however, becoming an increasingly important digital literacy skill for the work place and helping students to manage their collaboration can have a significant impact on their potential to be successful.TeamUp is a really useful and versatile tool for enabling teachers to do this.TeamUp is basically an online shareable calendar tool but with some unique features. One of the first and most important for teachers is that you don’t have to register and create passwords. This can make it much simpler to use with groups of students, especially younger or older ones who are prone to loosing or forgetting passwords.Creating a calendar on TeamUp couldn’t be simpler, just go to the site and click on ‘Create a free calendar’.You can then give the calendar a name and if you want to you can add your email address. Adding your email address is optional, but if you do add it you’ll be able to get notifications and save access details.The calendar is then created instantly and then you can either use it privately or share the link with students to allow them to edit it.There are a number of ways we could use this with our students.Each student could have their own calendar that they use to schedule homework and project due dates etc.You could have a group calendar based around a project and students could access and up date it collaboratively as they schedule their contribution to the project.You could use it to get students setting aims and goals by entering things they want to achieve over the coming year/ course. For example they can write in ‘By this date I would like to be able to …” Or “By this date I will have finished …”  Then they will get a reminder to check that they have achieved their goals.You could use it in a similar way to get students revising vocabulary so that when they learn new words they schedule times to revise the words at intervals of a number of days, weeks or months. They just need to add repeats to events when they add them.Students can use the calendar to keep a blog type learning journal after each lesson to record what they learned from the lesson and then look back and review it. You could also ask students to use it for short daily writing tasks so that they have a theme set up for each day and each student has to write a short text about the topic of that day.TeamUp can also be integrated into Facebook http://calendar.teamup.com/kb/add-teamup-calendar-facebook-profile/ , so if you have a Facebook group that you use with students you can add a calendar to it and enable greater functionality to the group.For more detailed instructions on how to use the calendar have a look at the getting started guide.   Shared Calendar for Groups and Projects - Getting Started with Teamup Calendar  from Teamup Calendar You can also try a live demo of some of the calendars here.I hope you find TeamUp useful and try it with your students.

{"title": "Take the pain out of marking homework with CorrectiveFeedback", "date": "Tuesday 31 March 2015", "text": "One of the most time consuming and at times depressing tasks any teacher has to do must surely be marking large piles of student homework. That may sound like an awful statement, but the truth is that however little or however much effort our students do or don’t put into their work, many of us know that when we have marked the work and and hand it back to the student, they will look briefly at the mark and then probably never look at the work or our comments again.So we all know that homework has to be marked and the students’ efforts have to be acknowledged, but we also know that often this process has very little positive outcome beyond that validation of the work our students have done.CorrectiveFeedback may well have an answer though to both the problem of the time taken to mark assignments and the effectiveness of the feedback given.CorrectiveFeedback enables you to automate a large part of the marking process and to also make the feedback you give more effective. It does this through using a number of marking ‘grids’ which you can customise to the needs of your students and the nature of your assignment.Once you apply a marking grid to an assignment it will automatically analyse the content of the assignment for things like spelling, grammatical areas, use of specific verbs students have studied or vocabulary range related to topic field. It will then even suggest links in the feedback that students can use to revise or expand their knowledge of the problem areas and produce a completed feedback analysis which you can then send back to the students.This is how it worksOnce you log in to the online platform you will arrive at the dashboard. The first thing to do is to click on ‘CREATE GRID’. This is where you select the type of marking grid and rubric you want to use for the assignment. There is a really wide selection of marking grid you can use and these vary from the expected ‘error correction’ of text to ones that you can use to record spoken feedback and respond to audio recorded homework assignments. You can also mix grids and combine them so that you have one part of the grid for analysing grammar and another part which includes spoken feedback so that your students can listen to your comments, instructions and encouragement.Once you have selected and created your grid it will be saved into the ‘MY GRIDS’ part of the site. Here you can store as many different marking grids as suits you and reuse them whenever you need them.The next stage is to start marking your students assignments. To do this you need to either upload the assignments or get students to email you there assignments. This process is made easier for you in two ways.CorrectiveFeedback creates a dedicated email address for you when you register, so that you don’t have to use your personal one, and any emails sent to this address automatically appear in your assignment section. The second option is that you can copy paste all of your students’ assignments into a spreadsheet and upload them all together.Once the assignments have been uploaded, go to ‘CHECK ASSIGNMENT’ on the dashboard and here you can select the grid that you want to apply to each homework assignment. Depending on the features of the grid you select, it will analyse the students work find errors or weaknesses in the vocabulary etc and produce a list of areas in the text for you to comment on or mark in some way.You don’t have to follow the suggestions of the grid, you just read through them and then select, deselect or edit the point you want to comment on and the comments you want to make. You can also award points based on a rubric or record spoken feedback. Once you have finished marking, your feedback is saved into the database and your students receive an email with a PDF of the feedback or links to your spoken audio feedback.The feedback your students are sent can also include auto generated links to grammar or vocabulary reference materials so students can follow up your comments in a constructive way.If you need to go back and check students’ assignments at a later date they are all stored in ‘CHECKED ASSIGNMENTS’ and you can even reedit and change the feedback and resend it.CorrectiveFeedback really is an impressive pedagogical tool and one that can potentially save teachers a lot of time and also enhance the learning process.What’s great about it?There is a real variety of different marking grids which you can quickly edit to your needsI love that you can record spoken feedback so that students can hear tone and intonation or even examples of pronunciationIt’s great that it can scan for errors or weaknesses in vocabulary and suggest helpful linksBeing able to collect together all your students work into a database where you can go back and retrieve it can be really useful when it’s time to write reports, etc.When you first sign up for CorrectiveFeedback you are automatically awarded 100 credits which enable you to mark 100 assignments. At present getting more credit is still free, though in the future there is clearly an intention to make this a commercial product.Paying for an online product may well be difficult for many teachers, especially when there are so many free tools around, but I feel that if you find a product that can really save you time for a reasonable price then it is worth supporting these products and putting a little money in. Ideally schools should be able to pay to enable teachers to use such things, though realistically we all know that seldom happens. I guess the decision we have to make is around the value of our time and how much of it a tool like this can save.I hope you give CorrectiveFeedback a try and that it saves you some time and helps to make your marking time more rewarding for you and your studentsRelated links:Why do so many Moodle courses suck?

{"title": "Practical English Usage - The App!", "date": "Saturday 1 November 2014", "text": "Practical English Usage by Michael Swan was one of the first books I ever bought when I started learning to teach. It's one of the few that I still keep on my shelf and probably the one that I have most often consulted, especially in those early years as a classroom teacher when I was having to field constant grammar questions from my enthusiastic students - who I suspected knew much more about the rules of grammar than I did.Now after more than 20 years, I'm delighted to say I have been asked to review the app version of the book.The app itself couldn't be simpler to use. It opens to an index on the left with a search field at the top and entries appear on the right.  It's very simple to navigate and the entries are cross referenced with hyperlinks, so browsing the contents in a non-linear way is much easier than it would be in a paper-based book.You can also add entries to your 'Favourites' so they are easy to come back to later and the app also tracks your browsing history, so if you get distracted by various hyperlinks to different entries you can easily find your way back.If you have problems reading the small print as I do myself these days, you can go to 'Settings' and adjust the size of the font and background colour to one that suits you better I know that a lot of paper book purists will object to this further step towards digitisation of more traditional content, but for me the advantages of having a reference book like this on my mobile rather than at home on my bookshelf far out weight the smell and the feel of the paper.These for me are the main advantagesI can have a the book with me as a reference where ever I am and even take it into the classroom with me.Using standard mobile features like AirPlay and a data projector I can project entries from the book onto the projector screen for my whole class to see and use it as a classroom tool.I can use features like text to speech to get the app to read examples to my students.I can grab quick screen shots and add these to my lesson plans or materials as reference.For me Practical English Usage has always been my definitive grammar reference, so now to be able to have it on my phone and tablet where ever I go makes it so much more useful and accessible. I might even throw that hold dog-eared paper copy away- well maybe not.The app is available for iOS, Android and Windows 8 and at £28.99 / $40.99 is slightly cheaper than the paper-based version.As a teacher, building up your own essential teaching reference library represents quite an investment these days, so having it all on your mobile device where it's always available for just-in-time learning makes so much more sense.Related links:Grammarly to check and improve your grammar Teaching Grammar Through SongsCrazy Comparatives & SuperlativeCreate Image BooksUsing Word Clouds in EFL ESLBestNik Peachey"},
{"title": "Business English eLearning", "date": "Saturday 25 October 2014", "text": "Having worked on many elearning and mlearning materials development projects I can safely say that I know what a huge task it is, even when working with experienced teams, to produce really good quality, well designed, interactive digital content and that’s why it is such a surprise to see Paul Emmerson’s new BEhereBEthere Business English site.The site is remarkable, because it doesn’t just tick all of the boxes for good design, excellent content and great interactive design, but it is also free and is produced by Paul working pretty much alone!As Paul state’s on the home page, the site is still under construction, but the courses and materials that are there already are really useful for either a self-study Business English student or for a teacher working with groups of Pre-intermediate to Upper Intermediate business students.To find the course materials, just click on ‘Free Courses’ and choose either ’Talk Business’ or ‘Business Bites’.The ’Talk Business’  section has a lesson based around an interview with a manager who discusses various issues relating to supply chain management in the auto industry. The video has preparation activities to help students understand the content, as well as activities to help students analyse the content and at the end students can text their understanding of what they have studied.At the end of the lesson there are also some classroom activities so teachers can use the materials as a form of ready made blended learning.The ‘Business Bites’ section has three courses, one at each level on the topic of Inbound Marketing. These courses have a strong emphasis on building students’ vocabulary around the topic as well as teaching the core concepts, so these aren’t just online language lessons they are also valuable lessons that help students to understand the topic area.The materials themselves rely heavily on video, but these aren’t just the usual talking head type video. The videos have been well produced and developed and all the points in the monologue are well illustrated to support students understanding.One of the things I like best about BEhereBEthere is the way Paul has designed the interactive activities. They are clear and intuitive and simple for students to navigate. Paul has also taken the time to add feedback for students when they get the answers wrong, so this isn’t these aren’t just click and test activities.As I said at the beginning of this review, the site is free but Paul is hoping to finance it on sales of his books, so do check out the ‘Books’ section of the site where you can download some samples of his books or if you like his content you can buy the books.I think BEhereBEthere is a great site to support Business English teachers and learners and I really hope that Paul gets the support he needs to keep the site going and keep developing new materials for it. If you are a Business English teacher, then do go along to and check out the content and sign up to get information when new courses are added.Related links:Multimedia Business Simulation Tools for Teaching Business EnglishAdvertisement ProjectUsing 'How to' videosCreate an Online CV in English BestNik Peachey"},
{"title": "HelloTalk - A language learning community on your mobile", "date": "Thursday 18 September 2014", "text": "I've always liked the idea of language exchanges and peer learning as the learning tends to be driven by and through an authentic desire to communicate.HelloTalk is a wonderful example of this, but with lots of nice features to make the process mobile and more efficient. Most of these features are accessed by pressing down on your partner's text to get the pop up tool bar.HelloTalk is a free app that you can download for either iOS or Android. Then once you have registered and created a profile you can find language partners to exchange languages with.Finding a partner Once you have registered on the app and created your profile showing which languages you speak and which you want to learn you can start looking for exchange partners. Clicking on 'Search' at the bottom of the screen will show you a list of the people on the site. You can browse this and see how recently they have been online and check out their profile or you can type in a specific name or email address to search for someone you know. You can also customise your search to specific age, level, nationality and you can even search for people from a specific city.Once you have found someone you can send them a message or add them as a partner and they will get a partner request.FeaturesOnce you start chatting with someone, things start to get interesting. You can text chat or send voice messages by clicking on the microphone icon to record.You can also send images or doodles using a drawing pad. These features open up the app to a deeper level of engagement as you can share more interesting content to talk about.You can play games like pictionary or use the doodle pad like a whiteboard to draw images and explain vocabulary. The images are then sent to your partner through their chat interface.If you don't understand what your chat partner is saying you can also press down on their text and get a translation.If your partner makes a mistake in their text you can correct them. Just press down on their message text then write in the corrected version of their text beneath the mistake and your partner will be able to see their version and the corrected version. You can even add an explanation comment. All of the corrections are automatically saved into a separate area of the app and you can go back and revise and check them.If you don't know how to express what you want to say in the language you are learning, you can also type in your mother tongue and get it translated before you post it.If you join a chat exchange group with your partner, you can decide whether you want to chat by text or by voice and for how long or how many words. The time spans are all quite short so this is ideal for doing some short bursts of learning when you have a just a few moments to spare or some time to kill on the train, etc.Finally, HelloTalk has a Notepad where you can send messages to yourself or copy and paste parts of your chats that you want to remember.SecurityOne of the first concerns with any service that connects our students to people they don't know, is their privacy and security. HelloTalk seem to be taking this very seriously and make it very clear that any one using the app for flirting or sexting purposes will be blocked and banned.There are a range of built in security settings. These include tools to block anyone making you feel uncomfortable as well as initial security and privacy settings that allow you to limit your visibility within the community and control who can approach you for language exchange.ConclusionI've been using HelloTalk for a few days now, mainly with my wife, who is teaching me Spanish, and I really like it. I feel like the learning tools and the record of our conversation and the corrections help to make my learning more tangible and enable me to reflect on our interaction and to go back and check things and revise.I really like that I can 'try to' express things and then get some immediate feedback on my errors. This happens when we talk face-to-face, but I don't have the written record of our interaction.It's great that HelloTalk are taking privacy seriously too and that it's very easy to block people or restrict who can see you.Because there are quite a few features, there is a learning curve to the app and it takes a little while to understand how to use everything, so it may be best to start off by practising with a friend just sitting next to them so that you can see what's happening on each device.The app is perhaps also best suited to younger people, though under 18s are discouraged, who are more comfortable with the concept of chatting to people they don't know online, but if you are feeling brave, then I certainly think that with regular use this could lead to improvements in your language level.If you recommend it to students, then it would also be good to set them some tasks to do or topics to discuss, as often the most difficult thing when talking to someone you don't know is just thinking of something to talk about.HelloTalk would also be a great app to use with your class to do language exchanges with a class in another country. You could partner your students up, set them tasks and know that they will be safe and have some tools available to support their language exchange experience.I'm really enjoying using HelloTalk now. I hope you find it useful too.Related linksVideo communication apps and mobile learningEvaluating authentic mobile apps for learningMix Images and Animation on Your Mobile Peer editing in digital and mobile environments iPhone for Speaking Homework iPad Apps for English Language TeachersCreate Books for the iPadGetting Learning out of the Classroom with Augmented Reality  How I use social media for my professional developmentBestNik Peachey"},
{"title": "Edupunk and student centred learning through technology", "date": "Monday 11 August 2014", "text": "I’ve often wondered why it is that the internet is such an amazing, creative and inspiring place full of so many fantastically interesting things, and yet so many educational software, applications and e-learning products turn out to be so dull.In many ways this doesn’t make sense because many of the teachers that I meet, especially in the field of ELT, are really remarkably creative people.Personally, I believe the problem lies in the institutions in which they work, in fact I’m pretty sure of this. Institutions are all about order, stability, control and accountability and to be fair I can understand why that is, but these are hard qualities to enforce on the rapidly changing face of technology.Educational technology providers are bound by the needs of their customers, who are the institutions, not the teachers or the students, and so the products they produce are limited by those same criteria.The result is a collection of learning management systems (LMS), interactive whiteboards and digital materials that mimic the traditional processes of institutionalised learning whilst doing little to develop the ‘real life’ skills that students need to negotiate the 21st century world of technological learning and communication and become the autonomous life long learners they will need to be.So, if the institutions in which we work aren’t providing the tools that we need to deliver the learning our students deserve, what do we as teachers do?For me, the answer to this is ‘Edupunk.’  Edupunk is a term that was first coined by Jim Groom, an instructional technologist working at the University of Mary Washington and it is a reaction against the attempts of corporate interests and commercialism to reframe learning into commercially defined products and applications.Edupunk encourages more of a student centred and ‘do it yourself’ approach to the use of technology in education - student centred because it focuses on using the tools and applications students will need and use in their everyday lives, and these are very unlikely to be interactive whiteboards and learning management systems,  and ‘do it yourself’ because it relies on the teacher to assess the needs of the students and work with them to develop materials and activities that will broaden their understanding and use of these tools and help them to apply them to learning.Of course this puts a considerable burden onto teachers and demands that they broaden their knowledge of technology and develop the ability to utilise an ever widening range of tools to help students achieve their learning goals.In the training work that I do with teachers around the world I try to focus on a very broad range of tools and web based applications, so much so that I’m often asked, ‘Well isn’t there one tool or one place we can go that can do all this?’ but I’m sad to say that I don’t think there is a ‘one tool’ solution and I’m not really sure that there should be.A one stop solution moves us back to the LMS and  being prescriptive about tools for containing learning, when learning should be about removing the boundaries on curiosity and discovery and learning how to cope with constant change.The good news is that in the post ‘Web 2.0’ age of mobile and web-based applications, apps has enabled us more than ever before to access a world of ‘real life’ tools and applications that we can adapt to the educational needs of our students and in many cases these don’t cost us a cent.I curate and regularly update a collection of these apps on one of my scoop.it sites: Tools for Teachers and LearnersAt present the site has in excess of 400 different web-based and mobile tools.All of these tools come with their unique problems and challenges, especially if you want to use them within an institution that has a tightly controlled IT infrastructure, where social networking functionality, installing browser plug ins and many interactive scripts are blocked. This doesn’t however stop you creating materials and activities that students can access from outside the institution. In fact getting students working with web based tools at home can have a far greater impact on their learning than using them in the controlled classroom environment.So, what’s stopping you? If you want to create student-centred learning that develops students’ language and digital literacies while also tapping into their creativity, everything you need is out there. Good luck and I hope you enjoy the adventure.Related links:Learning Technology News Online Teacher Development Works Best - 15 Reasons Why Why do so many Moodle courses suck?  How I use social media for my professional development Making lectures and lessons more interactive with mQlicker  The Web 2.0 School of the Present The Edupunks' Guide to a DIY CredentialBestNik Peachey"},

It’s great to have a friend to turn to in moments of doubt or better still someone who will proof read your work and give you a second opinion, but if you don’t have that luxury then the Grammarly plagiarism checker is probably the next best thing.You simply copy and paste your text in, click and Grammarly will read through your work checking a whole variety of different criteria and give you detailed feedback on a whole variety of issues around your text.Unlike most grammar and spell checkers, Grammarly can be set to be sensitive to your genre of writing and make suggestions based upon that.Grammarly highlights areas of potential error and then makes suggestions for you.You can then work through the errors deciding whether you want to correct them or leave them as they are.One really nice feature is the ‘Ask the community’ feature. So if you are really unsure whether you or Grammarly is correct you can post a question to the community and see what they have to say. Your question goes onto the Grammarly answers blog and this makes quite interesting reading for anyone with an interest in Grammar and error correction. This would be a great place to get your higher level students reading through problems and trying to decide how to help.Grammarly also gives you explanations why the grammar needs to be corrected, so using this regularly can help you to better understand the rules of English grammar.If you’re feeling that your vocabulary is a bit limited and repetitive, you can also use Grammarly to get suggestions for synonyms to replace some of the word you over use.Grammarly is also a very effective plagiarism checker, so if you are writing a long assignment or dissertation and you are worried that you may not have cited all of your sources, Grammarly can check through for you and find the link back to any online source you may have missed.Just out of curiosity I ran one of my previous blog articles through Grammarly. It came up with 72 potential errors. When checking through them, they weren’t all errors, but there were certainly a few, so knowing how hard it is to proof read your own text, I think I could be using Grammarly  again.There is of course a catch though as Grammarly isn't free. Whether you are prepared to pay for it though will depend on how much writing you do  in English and how important it is to you that it's absolutely accurate. I think for EAP students or teachers who have to do a lot or written work and marking of written work, Grammarly could be a very sound investment and save a lot of time.Related links:Get Students Checking Grammar and Collocation Teaching Grammar Through SongsCrazy Comparatives & SuperlativeCreate Image BooksUsing Word Clouds in EFL ESLAsk & Answer Video Questions4 Similar Tools to WordleCloze Test Creation ToolBestNik Peachey"},

He wanted to do what many of us do on a desktop or laptop computer and copy paste sections and quotes or take notes.After some research I found the Side by Side browser. This is a simple free app that you can download to your iPad (Sorry, no Android version) which allows you to have a browser window open in one half of the screen and a note taking app in the other half.

The need to develop students and teachers digital literacies has become increasingly accepted as fact and yet most teachers' and students' understanding of what exactly constitutes a digital literacy still seems to remain quite vague. Even more vague seems to be teachers' understanding of how precisely we go about developing those literacies.For some it is simply a matter of 'using' the hardware and by teaching a lesson that involves the use some form of new technology some teachers feel they are fulfilling their responsibility for developing their students' digital skills, but for some teachers developing digital literacies involves far more than coming to terms with the newest hardware gadget.So to try to identify what precisely those digital literacy skills are that we should be helping to develop I've launched this crowd-sourcing questionnaire to collect and share opinions from teachers around the world.Please read it and by all means contribute ideas and arguments for or against the various digital literacies outlined.NB: Registration isn't necessary to contribute an idea or opinion (Click the X when asked to register if you would prefer not to.)powered by triciderAlso feel free to leave questions in the comments below.I hope you find this useful.Related links:How I use social media for my professional development  Two Contrasting Views of Educational Technology  Online Teacher Development Works Best - 15 Reasons Why Developing your digital study skills Temporary BookmarkingCreating a personal homepage Social Networks and the Web 2.0 RevolutionCreate your own social network 7 steps A Tick List of 21st Century Digital Skills for Teachers  BestNik Peachey"},
{"title": "Developing geography related vocabulary", "date": "Tuesday 14 May 2013", "text": "I saw this website today and thought how great it would be to use it in the classroom for developing words related to places and describing different places. The site  GeoGuessr is actually based on Google maps and it's a simple game.The game works like this:You see an image of an unknown place somewhere in the world and you have to guess where it is and click that place on the map. Because this is based on Google maps street view you can actually explore around the image and look for clues.Once you click on the map you will see the real location and how close or far away you were.You are awarded points depending on how close you are to the real location.You have five turns to score as many points as possible. How to use the site for EFL /ESL The game itself doesn't really involve any language input or output, but you can easily add that.If you are using it in a single computer classroom you can show students the image and ask them to guess where it is. Ask them to justify their answers by describing what they can see. This way you can also practice modal verbs such as 'it may be', 'it might be' 'it could be', 'it must be' etc.If students are working on computers you can put them in pairs and get one student to describe what they can see and the other student to listen and try to guess where the place is.You could get students to make some notes and brainstorm words related to each of the places and then write a short description of each of the five places as though they visited them during a round the world journey.For lower levels you could just play the game and get the students to call out the names of the places. Check out my ebook What I like about the site This a is a great way to bring the world into the classroom.Students can really explore inside the images and pan around to look for clues.It's fun and a little bit addictive.It's an engaging and unpredictable way to get students interacting with content.

{"title": "Exploiting Infographics for ELT", "date": "Friday 5 April 2013", "text": "For a while now I have been increasingly interested in using infographics in the design of the learning materials and courses I create for students and teachers.For those of you who haven’t encountered the term ‘infographic’ before, an infographic is a visual representation of, what is often, quite dense statistical information.  This is the kind of information which can be very difficult to read as prose / text, but which, when transformed to a visual, can become accessible very quickly.If this explanation isn’t clear then you can click on the infographic about infographics and get an example which should make some of the benefits of infographics a bit clearer.There are a few reason I believe these infographics are so useful for language teaching (especially online) materials.They convey a lot of information using a minimal amount of language. This can make them useable at quite low language levels where intelligent materials for adult learners can be hard to find.They are quit vocabulary richThey are visual and the visual and mathematical / statistical aspects can help to convey meaning.They are much easier to read then dense text on a computer screen.They lend themselves to a wide range of tasksYou can find infographics quickly and easily on almost any topic.You can develop students visual literacy You can help students to become more critical of information sources (for example the infographic I linked to above has some interesting statistics, but are they true?)They are great preparation for EAP students who will have to deal with dense information in their studies.Finding infographics is quite simple. There are quite a few sites which specialise in publishing them.Visual.ly has huge collection and they are easy to search and locate.Daily Infographic also has a huge collection and if you sign up on the site they will email you a new one every day.Cool Infographic is also quite good. Failing all of these sites, you could just go to Google and type in any topic followed by the word infographic and then when you get the results go to ‘images’. This never fails to pull in something of interest on the topic. Once you have found the infographic you want to use, you’ll need to design a task. Here are a few generic tasks that could work with many of the infographics and don’t require you to do any preparation.Find 5 - 10 interesting facts in the infographic.Try to check some of the information in the infographic to find out if it is true or false. See if you can find a secondary source to support the information.Write up some of the information in the infographic as a summary text / report.Give a spoken presentation to the class using the infographic as support.Produce a quiz about the infographic to check the understanding of other students in the class.What information surprised you most in the infographic?If the infographic is a survey you could get students to compare the statistics in the infographic with an analysis of their class using the same questions. Here is an example of an infographic which I used with an adult class to do a similar thing - Have you ever?  As you can see it is very similar to ‘Find someone who’ and lends itself to practice of present perfect and past tenses. Use of infographics isn’t confined to receptive understanding though, there are also a number of free tools which can help you to produce your own.My favourite of these is https://www.draw.io/ which has a great collection of icons and images as well as the usual shapes and symbols. You can search through these easily and just drag and drop them onto you page, then either save it as an image or store it on Google Drive.If https://www.draw.io/ doesn’t work for you or you want something simpler, I have stored links to a collection of various infographic tools here on Meaki - Infographic tools  Again there are lots of tasks you can use to get students creating their own infographics. Here are a few.Get them to create an infographic based on a text they have read. This could include relationship map of the characters, timeline of events, actions that took place in particular places etc.Get students to convert a text which has statistical data into an infographic. This could be based on a classroom survey or could be something from a business magazine etc.Get students to create mind maps of words based around topic areas and add visuals to them.They could create an infographic of information based around a verb tense. This could include timelines and illustrated example sentences as well as breakdown of form and pronunciation features.These are just a few of the ways I think we could and should be exploiting infographics with students. I hope you find them useful.

{"title": "How do you play?", "date": "Tuesday 12 March 2013", "text": "How do you play? is a marvellous site with the instructions for a wide variety of educational and entertaining games which can be used  to practice and develop language skills.The site divides the games into eight different types:Active gamesBoard gamesCard gamesClassroom gamesIcebreakersParty games Sports Team buildingEach game has some basic information about how long the game will take and what materials are needed, followed by clearly written instructions for how the game is played. You can also vote up or down the games you try.There are quite a few games that you can use in the language classroom. Here are some of my favourites.Telephone charadesMine fieldIcebreaker questions (Good for 2nd conditional)Life timelinesPeople bingoHow to exploit this siteThis is a great resource to exploit with language learners and not just by playing the games with them.Get the students to read an entry then teach other students how to play the game.Get students to follow the model and create their own written game instructions for a game they know.Get students to read and select a game they would like to play.Copy the text of some instructions, cut them up and get students to organise them in the correct order to play the game (You can use Paragraphy to do this).Create a Wordle image of the game instructions and see if the students can use the words in it to recreate the instructions after they play the game.Here's an example of telephone charades.All learning starts with games and play, but a lot of the time that element of play gets lost as our children grow older and education becomes more of a serious process of cramming for exams. How do you play? has lots of materials that can be used to bring playful learning back into the classroom and make it a much happier and more language productive place.I hope your students enjoy these activities.Related links:Adventure Narratives for EFL ESL Educational Games That Really Are FunExploiting two computer-based RPGsGames With a Purpose and a Social NetworkCreate your own gameOnline Water Conservation GameBestNik Peachey"},
{"title": "A Great app for developing spelling", "date": "Sunday 25 November 2012", "text": "I've been a fan of SpellingCity.com for quite some time now and I was fascinated when I heard they had produced a free app. For those of you who don't know about SpellingCity, the website enables learners or teachers  to enter a word list and then automatically generate a range of interactive multimedia activities based around the words. The site automatically adds audio recordings of the words and example sentences to the activities it generates. There is a great range of activities that students can do within the site and they can generate certificates for their teacher or parent to prove they have done their homework.The app is in many ways very similar to the site. There are some ready made word lists and you just click on one and then click on the type of game or activity you want to play. The app has six different activity types:Spelling TestMe - In the activity students have to spell out the words from the word list. To do this they hear the word in isolation and then again in the context of a sentence. They then type the word into a field. At the end of the activity they find out how many of the words they spelled correctly.If they got any of the words wrong they can go to the 'Teach ME' activity which spells the word for them using audio and text and gives them an example sentence containing the word.The MatchIt activity tests the students understanding of the words by getting them to put the words into gapped sentences. Again the students don't get feedback until they have finished the activity, so this reduces the tendency to randomly try to guess.Which Word is a multiple choice type activity and students have to choose the correct word to complete the gap in a missing sentence.The Sentence Unscramble activity tests students understanding of syntax, by getting them to arrange the words from the sample sentences into the correct order. The students can get an audio hint on this activity if they are stuck.My favourite of the activities though, and the one that is most popular with my students is the Hang Mouse activity. This is SpellingCity's own variation on the hangman game. Students try to guess the letters that spell out words and each time they guess, the mouse runs to tab some cheese. Each time they guess incorrectly, the cat starts to wake up, and if they get too many wrong letters the mouse gets trapped.As you can probably tell, the app is aimed very much at the younger end of the learner market though the word lists do go up to grades 10 - 12.To get the best from the app you really have to have a SpellingCity account as this enables you to import your own word lists and to manage and track your learners' scores. That said, you can create a basic account for free.On the whole the Vocabulary SpellingCity isn't going to cause an educational revolution, but it is a good simple app which does what it sets out to do in a user friendly, engaging and intuitive way, so if your students' spelling and vocabulary needs some work then why not get them using it.You can download the app from the iTunes store at: http://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/id538407602Sadly there's no Android version available at the moment.If you have used the SpellingCity app or something similar I would love to hear your comments and suggestions.This post was sponsored by RM Education Shop a great place to buy all your educational technology hardware.Related links:iPhone for Speaking Homework iPad Apps for English Language TeachersCreate Books for the iPadGetting Learning out of the Classroom with Augmented Reality   Augmented Reality and Web 3.0Creating texting dialogues for students BestNik Peachey"},
{"title": "Tall Stories as Digital Narrative", "date": "Thursday 1 November 2012", "text": "One of my favourite ways of helping students with the difference in use between 'present perfect' and 'past simple'  forms is a simple but effective activity called lies and truth.All you need to do for this activity is to think of three - five statements about yourself using the 'present perfect' tenseHere are a few examples:I've been in prison.I've been married 3 times.I've never eaten meet.Then get your students to ask you for background information about them to find out which are true. The students should use past simple to get the details. Once the students find out about me they pair up and interview each other using the same format.This is a simple but engaging activity that I find students really enjoy it and get a lot of speaking practice from it.Recently, I've spotted a website called BluffBust that works on a similar format. The website contains video clips of people telling stories about themselves and then visitors to the site have to decide if the stories are truth or lies. Here's an example based around a song  Which story is true? 'I'm 6 feet tall'    'I drive a honda cr-v'   'I've never been to Hawaii'I think this is a great way to get students developing their listening and speaking skills and something that they can engage with outside of the classroom. The language being used is very authentic, so it might be a struggle for lower levels, but for higher levels it should be appropriately challenging and give them some real exposure to authentic English.All of the content on the site is user generated, so you can also get students registered and creating their own interactive video stories and activities. There are a number of game interaction types which you can see here: BluffBust Game TypesThis looks like a great way to get students developing the listening and spoken fluency outside of the classroom in an enjoyable and competitive (there is a leaderboard) way.  Which story is true? 'Legs not attached'    'Expensive hand cream'   'No Macarena'The site might not be appropriate for younger or lower level learners though, but you could pre-sellect some specific videos that you could use in class as a way to get your students practicing the same activity in class.I hope you and your students enjoy BluffBust and it helps them to develop their speaking and listening skills.Related links:Create a Video Q&A BoothAsk Oprah a Question So Ask Me a QuestionCreate a Video Dictation Activity20 WebCam Activities for EFL ESL StudentsAnimated Music Videos for EFL Creating multimedia storiesTutorial: Using Videos from YouTubeBestNik Peachey"},
{"title": "Create Instant Interactive Text Based Activities", "date": "Tuesday 11 September 2012", "text": "Creating computer based materials can be incredibly time consuming and also very frustrating as websites and web based content can change so quickly, that's why it is always so nice to discover tools like Textivate which can enable you to create instant interactivity using almost any text you find from around the web.All you need to do is copy and paste your text into the Textivate window and then click on 'textivate now'.Here you can see some text I have copied from the Goldilocks story which I found on the Project Gutenberg site.Now I get a range of different exercise types to choose from. All I have to do to generate the exercise is to click on one of the square and I instantly have an interactive activity.There are quite a few to choose from. Most of the first row divides the text into 'tiles' each of which have a portion of the text on. The students then have to put the text in the correct order by dragging and dropping them (NB: the columns work horizontally rather than vertically.)You can also have the text arranged vertically so that students drag and drop the parts into position.Some of my favourite task types it creates are the instant gapfill activity.And the text reconstruction activity ( you can choose how many letters from each word are missing and even have all of them deleted if you want to.)If you sign up and register (for free) you can save the texts that you use in the activity and have access to texts that other users have uploaded.These activity types aren't new or revolutionary, but they do enable you to create instantly what a few years ago would have taken an experienced programmer hours to create. This means that you can change authentic web based reading texts into interactive texts and get them into your classroom on a projector or IWB in seconds.You can make this tool available to your students and get them testing and developing their own reading and syntactical skills on their own computer for homework.Best of all, if you register and log in, you can find a 'Share' button on your activities and get either a URL or an embed code to  add these to blogs, Moodle sites or other online materials. (My thanks to Martin Lapworth from Textivate for pointing this out as I completely missed it)As I said, the activities aren't revolutionary or new, but they are useful ways of getting students to review texts and to look in more depth and the syntactical relationships between the words.Why not try this one out for yourself and see how you get on:Click below to access the activity.

{"title": "Mind Mapping in ELT with MindMaple", "date": "Saturday 30 June 2012", "text": "I have been fascinated with mind mapping since I first read Tony Buzan's  book on this topic many years ago. I used  it quite a lot when I was studying music, to break down the structure of compositions as well as to brainstorm the structure of essays and assignments, so I was delighted when my new sponsors - MindMaple asked me to look at their product.For those of you who don't know much about mind maps, they are like diagrams which include words, images and icons to explore ideas and make the connections between ideas. here's an example from WikipediaWhen I was at college, these were drawn by hand on large sheets of paper but nowadays they can be produced using computer programs, and MindMaple is one such program. Using a program like MindMaple to do this has a number of advantages (especially if you don'r draw well).  The program comes with a library of images and graphics and you can import in your own photographs and illustrations too. You can also hyperlink words to website and webpages as well as upload files as attachments. Features like these make it much easier to produce a really useful finished mind map that you can share with other people.MindMaple does this pretty well with a good clean interface which is pretty intuitive for anyone familiar with 'Office' type software.MindMaple is software so you do have to download and install it and there are many pros and cons around that. If you work in a school or institution that has good IT support, or better still none, then you can get software installed pretty easily and especially if you done have a great internet connection MindMaple will be fast and easy to use. If you work in a school that has a very security conscious IT department it could take you months to get this installed whereas a web based tool you could probably use immediately - if you have a good connection.So how do you use mind mapping with students?There are a number of really useful ways of applying mind maps in your teaching.You can get students to create a mind map of the lesson as a form of note taking to help them revise later. Or you can create a mind map of each lesson and give them to students to see how much they can remember from the lesson.You can get students to make a mind map of a book, story or text they are reading. This could involve mapping the relationships of the characters, adding in characteristics, adding in actions that each one does etc.In an EAP context you could get students to create mind maps of more academic texts they are reading, so that they represent the information from the text visuallyYou can get students to create vocabulary mind maps based around themes such as sport or politics and they can gradually add words to these and organise them in categories around the central theme.You could get students to research a topic and create a mind map to display their findings, such as research into a historical place or event. They could hyperlink their mind map to the relevant research sources they find.You could create or get students to create grammatical mind maps research a specific verb tense with break down of form, and pronunciation points as well as few examples and notes about concepts etc.You could get students to create infographics using MindMaple. Infographics usually compare contrasting ideas or display statistical information. Here are some examples: Infograpgics There are many tools and software available for creating mind maps, but these are some of the things I particularly like about MindMapleIt has some really useful formatting tools that help you make the mind map look nice. You can easily change the look of your mind map and in a single click apply a hole different colour palette.You can add callouts and notes to the mind map. These appear and pop up when you haver the mouse over parts of the mind map image.It's great that you can add your own images as icons within the topic blocks.You can drag the topic blocks around the screen to arrange them with your mouse, but MindMaple also has a really handy balance tool that with a single click will arrange the whole of your mind map so that it looks tidy and symmetricalMindMaple - in the premium version - exports to quite a few formats which makes it pretty flexible as a tool, you can export your mind maps to pdf and use them as wall charts or save them as Word documents. The Word document export also shows a breakdown of the different levels of your map so you can use this a the framework for structuring an assignment.Things that I'm not sure aboutThe concept of 'software that you download and install seems very 'old school' these days with so many browser based tools around, but as discussed earlier, there are some advantages to this.It would be great to have a mobile version of MindMaple or at least a function html 5 web based version (I'm told that they are working on a mobile version).It's great that MindMaple exports to html, but there isn't any hosting support, so if you ant to get your mind maps online you have to have access to some sort of server space. This can be a real stumbling bock for many teachers.The  built in clip art and selection of backgrounds is still a little limited and it would be good to have more variety to choose from.MindMaple has free and a premium version. You can compare he differences here: http://mindmaple.com/Products/ but the main ones seem to be the export features are more limited in the free version and there are fewer themes and images .At $9.99 a year MindMaple is a pretty good buy for those who take their mind mapping seriously or you can buy a lifetime license for $50. There doesn't seem to be an institutional license option and you would probably need this if you wanted to get it installed in a school for students to use.So if you work in a school where installing software is no problem or if you want to try it on your own computer then I think it's well worth downloading the 'lite' version and seeing how well it works for you. If you take your mind mapping really seriously and want a good reliable product that isn't going to disappear ( as many web based products do) then it's well worth thinking about MindMaple Pro.I hope you find MindMaple useful and enjoy making some beautiful mind maps.Related links:Create Image BooksGreat Time Line ToolInteractive presentationsA Picture's worthPicture phrasesPersonalised flashcardsAnimating vocabularyExploiting Image SequencesBestNik Peachey"},

{"title": "Teachers are Like Sharks", "date": "Monday 11 June 2012", "text": "In the classic 1977 movie - Annie Hall, there is a scene where Woody Allen compares relationships to sharks and says that they have to constantly move forward or they start to die. In many ways I think the same can be said of teachers. Many of us work with our classes in complete isolation and are rarely observed and when we are then it is often only for the purpose of quality check rather than as part of a process of continuous development.In my own case I was often lucky enough to work in schools that had regular development seminars, or a lively staffroom where teachers willing talked about and swapped teaching ideas and materials. For many though I know this isn't the case, though the growth in access to Internet services has enabled a lot of teachers to find their own way towards their continuing development, so now as part of a workshop I'm developing I would like to ask you how you keep developing your teaching and which methods do you find most effective.Please contribute your ideas to the questionnaire below.

{"title": "Engage Students with Flipped Video Tasks", "date": "Friday 8 June 2012", "text": "The concept of the flipped classroom seems to be gaining ever increasing momentum within the field of education generally. Much of this revolves around the use of video to deliver input / lectures to students who can then come to class and do the more engaging and practical part of their work with some teacher support.One of the major criticisms of this method though is that a dull unengaging content doesn't suddenly become engaging because it's on a video on the web, so how do we get students to engage with the content and make sure they watch it in a challenging and interactive way.Vialogues is a useful tool for attempting to do this (though dull content will always be dull) because it enables you to create interaction around the video that actually gets students to think about and engage with the content.Here's an example Vialogue I created around one of my own (rather old) short videos.As you can see it has the YouTube video (you can also upload video from your computer if you prefer) but I have been able to create a few questions and simple polls for students to interact with at specific points in the video. Here's a quick video which shows you how it was done: How to create a VialogueAs I said, this doesn't make the content any more lively, but it does make the viewing process a little more interactive and collaborative.So if you think the flipped classroom approach is for you ( and your students) then Vialogues could be a good tool to try.I hope you enjoy it.Related links:Visualize sentences with video clips  Create Online Social Interaction Around Videos  Cropping YouTube Videos to Create ActivitiesQuick Twitter Video Activity20 WebCam Activities for EFL ESL StudentsGreat Video Commenting ToolVideo conferencing for EFLSend Free Video MessagesBestNik Peachey"},
{"title": "Create Quick Video Conferencing Rooms", "date": "Monday 4 June 2012", "text": "Video conferencing is becoming an increasingly common form of communication within business, learning and within our day to day social lives.  So what are you doing to help your students get to grips with this important medium and to help them communicate effectively with video conferencing tools?Well if your answer is 'Nothing' here's your chance to get started. Meetings.io is a free and very quick and easy tool to help you create a video conferencing chat room that you can use wit your students.All you have to do is go to: http://meetings.io/  and click on 'Get a Meeting Room'.This creates a link to a unique meeting room for your meeting. You copy the link and send it to any of your students you want to meet up with.Then click on 'Enter Now' and you'll just need to add your name and then enter the room.At this point you may get a message asking you to allow access to your webcam and audio. This is nothing to worry about, just click 'Allow'.At that point you should be able to see yourself in your webcam and you just have to wait for your students to arrive.If you look to the bottom of the screen you'll see that you can also open a note pad  so that you can take notes during meetings and that file sharing and screen sharing are coming soon.Here's the link to the meeting room I created: http://m1.io/8Cn  There's unlikely to be anyone there, but you can use the link to see how it connects on your computer. It's great that you can do all this without even registering on the site. There is a registration option too though and if you do use this you can create your own permanent room and schedule and manage meeting etc.So this is a great free, cheap and easy way to get your students into a video conferencing chat room, but what do they do once they are there?Here are some suggestions for video chat room activitiesTell them a story - Ask them to make notes as they listen then come to the next class and retell what they remember of the story using their notes.Interview a visitor - Get visitors from outside the class to come to the chat room so that they can interview them and then write up the interview. (Make sure they prepare questions first and have some idea of who and why they are interviewing)Show and tell - Ask each student to bring a long an object that has significance for them and ask them to show and tell the other students about it.Salesman simulation - Ask the students to bring along an object and attempt to sell it to the other students. They must describe the object's features and say why it is a bargain. You could add to this simulation by giving a students a budget to spend on the different objects.Tutorials - You can use the chat room for one to one tutorials with your students and give them some feedback on their progress.ProblemsOf course one of the biggest problems with these kinds of activities is that they take place outside of classroom time and so they can be difficult to co-ordinate as you need to get groups of students online at the same time.There is also likely to be problems with sound and vision if students don't have good equipment and good connectivity.There is also likely to be a limit on the number of students that can gather in one room before it slows down too much.If you are worried about all these problems, then probably the easiest way to get started and use something like this is to try to get a visitor online who your students can interview in class.You could also try to get your students to use the chat room autonomously to do homework in pairs or to peer tutor and support each other.Well I hope http://meetings.io/ helps you to get started with video conferencing. It's something that's likely to become increasingly important in the day to day lives of our students, so let's help them use it effectively.Related links:Create Video Questionnaires  Create a Video Q&A BoothSo Ask Me a QuestionCreate a Video Dictation Activity20 WebCam Activities for EFL ESL StudentsTeach Yourself to Teach with TechGet your Students Listening and Interacting with Native SpeakersBestNik Peachey"},
{"title": "Digital Study Skills - Gist Reading", "date": "Thursday 19 April 2012", "text": "Studying and researching online is becoming an ever more important element of our digital skill set. I spend a lot of time reading online and skimming through numerous articles from journals and blogs, so I'm always keen to find useful tools which can assist me or my students in this and make the process more efficient.  One tool which I have just discovered and which I hope will help with this process is Cruxbot.It's a very simple to use 'bookmarklet' tool (a bookmarklet is a button that you drag onto your browser bookmarks bar). To get the bookmarklet go to: http://www.cruxbot.com/howToUse.html click on the 'Cruxbot' image. Hold your mouse down while you drag it to the bookmarks bar on your browser.Once the bookmarklet is installed just find an article that you want to read and then click on the bookmarklet (You can try this one on connectivism or this article from the BBC).When you click on the bookmarklet it will analyse the text and provide you with a summary of the main points. It will also pull out some key words and terms from the article.Clicking on the keywords will show them in the summary and re-summarise using those key words as the main focus.You can also decide how many paragraphs you want in the summary  by using the slider at the bottom of the window.For me, Cruxbot is a great tool for both teachers and students.It can help you quickly get the gist of an article and help you decide if you want to read it in more depth. It can help your students create a framework of the article in their mind before reading in more depth and so aid understanding.Students can see key words and terms in context to build a better understanding of them before they read.Cruxbot is a valuable tool that I will continue to use myself and one that I feel can make digital reading more efficient and effective and help students engage with online text.Lastly, I'd like to welcome Worth Ave Group as a new advertiser.

{"title": "iPhone for Speaking Homework", "date": "Wednesday 18 April 2012", "text": "Getting students to do speaking homework has always been quite a challenge, but for those students with smartphones we can now get them using free apps to practice and develop their speaking abilities. This speaking tasks requires the download of a free app called the VTR2 Video Recording Teleprompter from http://vrt2.com/.The app acts as a teleprompter which scrolls a text across the screen of your devices and records you speaking as you read the text.The app can be used on iPhone or an iPad with a camera. It's very simple to use. When you launch the app you see 3 buttons at the bottom of the interface. These are:1. The video gallery icon which links to a collection of all the movies you make with it.2. The 'Record' button, which starts the text scrolling and records you speaking.3. The settings icon which enables you to control the speed and size of the text scrolling and change the text.To get started, find a text that you want your students to read. I chose a poem as this is more suitable for reading out loud.Go to the settings and scroll down to text. There you can replace the existing text with the one you or your students want to read.Then then tap on 'Done'. Now go back to the launch screen and click on 'Record'. Read the text as it scrolls down the screen and then when it is finished click the 'Record' button again to stop it.You can then click on discard to try again or 'Save' if you want to view your recording. You need to give the recording a name and to save it.You can then go to the gallery and watch and listen. From the gallery the videos can either be deleted or shared.Tapping on the 'Share' button enables users to either send the recording as an email attachment or upload it to YouTube.The video recordings export to email as .mov and are quite big files, so emailing them can be slow. So, if you have a YouTube account for your class and they are confident enough, it might be good to get students uploading and sharing them there or on a blog.How to use VTR2 with studentsYou can get them recording short poems or monologues from films. This is particularly effective if they have a model that they can compare their recording to so that they can try to improve.You could get the students to record jokes to share so that they practice good timing and delivery.You can get them to record speeches or quotes from famous people.Try to get students listening to each other and praising the ones they like best.Give students feedback on ow and where they can make improvements and get them to record again.You can also get students to think about how they look when they are speaking, so that they think about some of the visual aspects of communication like eye contact, facial expression etc.Try to keep an archive of your students recorded work so that both you and they can go back and look at earlier work to see improvements.Most feedback on speaking activities is given by the teacher after the activity and it can be hard for students to remember or be aware of what they did wrong or right at the time, but using a tool like this students can really see and hear what's happening when they are speaking and you can really give them tangible feedback on their performance.I hope you enjoy this  http://vrt2.com/ and that your students find it a really useful way of improving their speaking skills.Related links:Getting Learning out of the Classroom with Augmented Reality  Augmented Reality and Web 3.0Creating texting dialogues for students Audioboo to Posterous 3 Tools for exploring wifi during presentations Questioning the role of technology in education iPad apps for English language teachersSome Pros and Cons of iPads for ELT   BestNik Peachey"},
{"title": "Create interactive cloze texts", "date": "Saturday 17 March 2012", "text": "For many years now I've known lots of teachers who get really enthusiastic about creating interactive activities with tools like Hot Potatoes. This is great but can be quite time consuming to learn and you need to find somewhere to put your activities online once you have created them. Learnclick is a very good alternative that can help to make this process quicker and easier.First you simply go to the Learnclick website and click on 'Create a Cloze Test'.Once you have done this you simply type in the title of your text and either type in or copy paste in the text that you want to work with (I've chosen a short story from Andrew Wright's marvelous blog).Next you select a word that you want to take out of the text and then click on 'Create Gap Word'.The selected word will go blue and should look a little like a hyperlink. You then click on 'Add a Hint' and you will be able to add a clue to help the student.You will need to go through the entire text adding your gaps and hints. Remember don't add too many and make sure there is enough context around the gap to help students deduce what the missing word should be.Once you have added all your gaps you can click on 'Show More Options' and this will allow you to limit the number of attempts the students can have at filling each gap.Then you just click on 'Start Query' and you activity will be created.If you sign up and log in before you start creating your activity you will also be able to save it to a page that you can share with your students. You can then give them the link to your public page to do all the activities you create or just the link to a single activity.It is also possible to create classes and track students' grades, but for this you'll need a premium account. At present, this is only $5 a year, so not a huge investment if you want to get serious about creating online tests and interactive activities for your students. If you go for a free account you'll only be able to have 5 stored texts.Personally, I'm not a huge fan of these types of activities, but I can see that they do have a place in language development and testing and I know that lots of teachers really value them, so if you are one of those, then why not give Learnclick a try? I hope it works for you.Related links:Create Authentic Text Based LessonsCreate EFL / ESL Lesson Plans in MinsCreating Texting Dialogues for StudentsTeaching Grammar Through SongsFind Easy to Read Text for Lower LevelsTranslate Shakespeare 2 Text Lingo 4 Twitter??Cloze Test Creation ToolBestNik Peachey"},
{"title": "Create Authentic Text Based Lessons", "date": "Sunday 11 March 2012", "text": "I think we all know how potentially motivating authentic materials can be for our students, especially if those materials deal with something current and of direct relevance to our students' interests. The web is abundantly rich in these kinds of materials, but creating lessons based around authentic online materials can be time consuming and complex. There are issues of copyright to deal with, as well as the fact that once we have created our lessons, the text we build them on may disappear. If this is a problem you regularly face, then Lingle could be the answer to your prayers.Lingle takes the process of finding text and creating lessons and exercises and turns it into a quick and simple 'click through' process.Once you have registered on the site you will see a search field at the top of the page. Here you simply type in a key topic word around which you want your search to be based. You then also select levels and grammar points to refine your search.Lingle will then show you a list of results that match your search along with dates and information about each article. You can the refine your search again to select texts from a particular source or based upon how recent they are.Once you have found your text though, the real fun begins. At the click of a button, you can see all the topic related vocabulary or the difficult words instantly highlighted.If you prefer to see the grammar contained in the article just click on the grammar tab, and you can see an analysis of the grammar in the article and see different grammar points highlighted.All of this is fine, but how about creating a lesson? Clicking on 'Create a lesson' will open a new window for you to name your lesson and add a description. You can also decide if you want to include glossary or a gapfill activity based around the vocabulary in the text.Now your text along with the glossary and gapfill activity will appear in preview mode. You can add additional activities to your lesson by clicking on 'Add Exercise'. You get a choice of 6 different types of exercise: Four of these are vocabulary or grammar gapfill type exercises and the other two enable you to create freer activities that you can write in yourself. These could be things like reading comprehension or discussion tasks etc.Although these exercises are automatically generated, you do also have the opportunity to edit them and change any element you don't like.Once you have finished adding exercises you can also arrange them in the order you want them and then print your lesson to use in class or save your lessons so that you can comeback and edit it again at a later date.Lingle doesn't instantly create great lessons for you, you'll still have to think carefully about which exercises you use and how to arrange these so that you take your students on a developmental path through the materials, but it does take a lot of the hard manual work out the materials creation part and help you to create a collection of professional looking materials that you can access from any computer.The sad part though is that Lingle isn't free. You can sign up for free and get a 6 day free trail. This will allow you to create up to 15 lessons and decide if you want to pay for an account. The price for a single one year subscription is €40, which is pretty good if you are going to use the site regularly to create materials and it could pretty quickly pay for itself by saving you time when you are creating materials.I really enjoyed trying Lingle out. To get the best from it, you should have a look at the collection of instructional videos they have on the Lingle YouTube channel as they will show you in much more detail what it can do and how best to use it.I really liked that it helped to find lower level texts so quickly and that it stores all the materials I create. On the down side, some of the gapfill vocabulary activities it created didn't really have enough context around the words to give a clear indication of which word went into the gap, but you can edit these ones out and select new ones from the Lingle database.On the whole I would say that Lingle is a pretty good deal for anyone who wants to get away from a course book or who regularly has to create their own materials for specific groups. Why not sign up for a free trial, give it a try and leave a comment below telling me what you think of Lingle.Related links:Create EFL / ESL Lesson Plans in MinsCreating Texting Dialogues for StudentsTeaching Grammar Through SongsFind Easy to Read Text for Lower LevelsTranslate Shakespeare 2 Text Lingo 4 Twitter??Cloze Test Creation ToolBestNik Peachey"},
{"title": "Create and exploit silent movies for language practice", "date": "Saturday 3 March 2012", "text": "The recent success of the film 'The Artist' seems to have created a lot of interest in silent black and white movies again. These kinds of movies are great for using with students as the visual aspect makes the context very clear and they show how video can communicate without language and focus students on the non verbal aspects of communication.Now you can create your own silent movies using the Artistifier and any clip that you can find on YouTube.To create a silent movie, just pick a clip and copy the URL. Then go to: http://www.theartistifier.com and paste in the URL and click on 'Artistify'.The film will then start to play as a black and white silent movie on the webpage. Next give the movie a title and add your name as director.Now as you watch the movie you can pause it and click on the 'Captions' line to add dialogue or description to the movie. When you click a small box will appear and you can type in the commentary.When you play the clip the commentary will appear in the movie.When you have finished adding commentary to the clip, just click on save and you will get a link to your silent movie. The movie with them play in your browser. Be sure to save the URL of your movie so that you can share it with your students.Here's an example that I started: http://www.theartistifier.com/view_8926. It comes from a movie clip on YouTube that I found here: Lot Like LoveSo how can we use this with our students?We can just create a silent version of a movie clip and get the students to watch and then describe what they saw and what they think was happening. They could write this up as a summary and then compare with the original clip on YouTube.We can ask students to watch and suggest / write dialogue.We can ask students to discuss what they think the characters are thinking or feeling. See if they can justify by describing what they see in the movie.We can get the students to pick their own clips and create their own silent movie and type in their own dialogues and descriptions. They can share these and select the best one for an award.The Artistifier is a useful creative site, but like most things built on the popularity of a single movie, it might not be around for very long, so make the best use of it you can while it's there. I hope you enjoy it.Related links:Visualize sentences with video clips  Create Online Social Interaction Around Videos  Animated Music Videos for EFL Create Video Questionnaires Cropping YouTube Videos to Create Activities 20 WebCam Activities for EFL ESL Students  BestNik Peachey"},

{"title": "Creating Music with Students", "date": "Thursday 2 February 2012", "text": "I’ve always been interested in the use and role of music and song in the classroom, so when I was asked to review MusicShake, I jumped at the chance.MusicShake offers students and teachers the opportunity to create original music and sound tracks that they then own. This is great for adding sound tracks to videos, multimedia creations, digital projects and presentations or even creating your own classroom songs or raps, like the Rapping Teacher  MusicShake has two main areas. The first is a site where students and teachers can share , rate and even sell the music they have created (You can listen to it for free and only need to buy it if you want to download it and use it.) You can find it here: MusicShake SongsYou can search the site by Genre, Mood or Theme, just by clicking on the tabs to the right.The more exciting part of MusicShake is the MusicShake editor which enables any student to easily and quickly create a backing track, even if they don’t have any ability on a musical instrument. Creating music with MusicShake is pretty simple and it’s just a matter of selecting different instruments and sounds and deciding which bars and for how long each instrument plays. Anyone who has seen Apple’s GarageBand at work will find this even simpler. Students can listen to their work as they progress and adding and editing out sounds and instruments is easy.Here’s a video from YouTube that shows how it’s done:When the music track is complete it can be downloaded as MP3 or Wave file or saved and shared through the MusicShake site. Just click here to give it a try: http://edu.musicshake.com/demoMusicShake is an education focused product so this also promises some degree of protection for your students and some policing of content that may be offensive.On the whole if you like using music with your students and you want to them to make something original and creative then MusicShake is a great choice. The downside and of course there had to be one, is the price $499 per year. At this price, using MusicShake is a decision that is certainly beyond the realm of the individual teacher’s pocket and so would have to be an institutional purchase. You would also have to know that it would get plenty of use across your institution, but on the pro side it would at least be very simple to handle training as it is so easy and intuitive to use.I hope you enjoy it.

{"title": "Could Doceri be the IWB killer?", "date": "Monday 9 January 2012", "text": "Just before Xmas I reviewed a potential IWB killer app called Idea Flight. This was the first of a batch of iPad apps that I have found which attempt to replace the need for an IWB. Idea Flight attempted this by enabling the networking of groups of iPads and one of the primary criticisms that readers pointed out with this system is that it was limited to contexts  in which students all had iPads.Doceri takes a very different approach though. Doceri requires that you have a data projector with either a laptop or desktop attached, but using a small app on the iPad and a small piece of software on the computer, it enables you to take control of the main computer with all it’s installed software, and Flash functionality, directly from your iPad.The iPad app has all the normal software installed that would expect with your IWB, so you can use different modes such as a whiteboard mode that enables you to write on the board from your iPad using your finger or an additional stylus, or surf the internet and interact with the computer native software, or you can mix the two modes and annotate over web pages or software based applications. The app records your annotations too so that you can play them back as video animations.Here are just a few of the features of the Doceri app shown as iPad screen grabs.You see the computer desktop on your iPad and can access all the computer's software through the interface. You can access files images and different whiteboard backgrounds through the app's folders. You can manipulate the computer software, click your way through websites or presentations and point out different features by using two fingers on your iPad screen. You can get left mouse clicks or right click menus by using two fingers on the iPadYou can call up an onscreen keyboard for text input.You can annotate over software applications or web pages using a range of pen types and record the annotations to play back later.The board can be used as a normal whiteboard and you can write and draw from it and hand the iPad  around to students to let them control the space.You can find more detail about the app features on the Doceri website at: How to use Doceri Features or watch this video to see the basic features.Recently, I’ve started using Doceri at conferences to control my laptop during presentations, and although it took a little bit of getting used to at first I’m starting to find the ability to control presentations and switch between presentation, interacting with live web and software applications without having to keep going back and fiddling with my laptop pretty handy.What I like about DoceriIt’s not free ($50) but it’s much cheaper than an IWB.It’s great to be able to control the whiteboard from where ever you are in the room.You can pass the iPad around and give students control of the boardIt’s wireless so no fuss with leads.Easy to switch between modes.I love that you can record and play back annotations etc.It’s great that it’s portable so you can use the app on any computer in any room as long as it has the software installed (The computer part is free) So it’s great for schools who are supplying teachers with iPads (and they should be).You can store all your lesson documents on the iPad and access them from where ever you are.It’s possible to make surprisingly accurate mouse gestures using your fingers on the iPadYou never need to have your back to the class and can maintain eye contact much more easily.What I’m not so sure aboutWriting reasonably sized letters with your finger is a bit tricky, so I think the Doceri Good Point Stylus is a must buy ($39).The app software doesn’t come with as many fancy tools and library objects as an IWB, but that could be an advantage when it comes to training and teachers will want to build up their own library of images and docs etc to use.It would be good to have a couple more tools that enable you to draw shapes and tables without having to do them freehand. I also miss some of my favorite IWB tools like the spotlight function and the curtain for slow reveal.It takes a little bit of time to get used to manipulating the left and right click using the fingers of one hand, especially if you are used to walking around and are hanging onto your tablet with the other hand, especially if like me you tend to gesticulate a lot with your hands.Teachers are generally more comfortable with a pen in their hand.As I said before Doceri isn’t free, though there is a 1 month free trial If you want to try it out. At $50 and considering you need to get the software installed on any computers you want to use it with, this probably isn’t going to be a purchase for the average teacher, though it might be something you try to get your school to invest in instead of IWBs.For someone like me though, who does a lot of work in different schools and a lot of presenting at conferences, Doceri is well worth the investment as I can turn up anywhere with my laptop and iPad and know that I’ll have IWB functionality and that’s certainly worth the $50.So, what do you think? Could Doceri be the IWB killer?  Related articles: Can you replace your IWB with a $10 app?Learning Technology News Tools for LearnersQuestioning the Role of Technology in EducationiPad Apps for English Language Teachers AudioBoo to Posterous: Audio Podcasting from the Classroom Survey Results: Mobile learning for ELT How to Make Your Own Pronunciation Flashcards BestNik Peachey"},
{"title": "Visualize sentences with video clips", "date": "Tuesday 22 November 2011", "text": "A while back (well actually about 3 years ago) I wrote an article about Phrasr, a service that helps to visualize sentences by linking them to Flickr images, well now Vizlingo has taken this a step further. Vizlingo enables you to type sentences and see them recreated as a linked sequence of video clips. Here's an example: This is a very smart way to visualize words and sentences. You like it?These are easy to create, you just type your sentence into the field below the video and click on 'Create'. You may have to wait a few moments while the video is assembled and then it will play with the words that are represented underneath each clip.If you don't like one of the clips in your sentence you can select it in the 'Lingo Breakdown' and you will see a number of alternative clips you can insert to replace it. If you want to save or share your clips you will need to register and log in. Once you have done this you get a number of sharing options, including Twitter, Facebook and YouTube as well as getting a direct link to the video clip.This is a great tool for students who are visual learners as it helps to connect the concepts in the sentence to visual reminders.Some suggestions for activitiesWhen learning vocabulary get students to create example sentences using the word (or better still two words) they want to remember in the sentence.Try to assemble short dialogues using a number of clips.Explore the relationship between the images and the words (The link can be a bit abstract sometimes).Show students the clips and see if they can guess the sentence (cover the words)Give students a list of ten sentences and see if the can link them to the videos you have created (again cover the words)Get students to create a clip from a line or the title of a song in English and try to guess each others' song.  Get students to create clips of idioms, for example To some extent I think the value of getting students to create sentence visualizations like this and think about and select appropriate clips to represent different words has more value than the actual finished videos. It can really help the to explore the concepts of words.Vizlingo is still in development at the moment and is likely to get better as more clips are added and more features (it looks like there will be a mobile version) so this is a simple tool that is well worth keeping an eye on. I hope you enjoy it.Related links:Create Image BooksGreat Time Line ToolInteractive presentationsA Picture's worthPicture phrasesPersonalised flashcardsAnimating vocabularyExploiting Image SequencesBestNik Peachey"},

There is also a button to select for 'Learner errors'. I haven't been able to get this to work yet, but to be able to search common learner errors really would be a very useful addition to such a site.There are lots of ways we can use this site with EFL and ESL students.We can create gapped sentences using the contextualised results from the concordancer, then create a Wordle that students can try to select the answers from.We can create collocation Wordles and get students to try to make sentences with the combinations.We can get students to use it as a tool to research words and collocations.We can get students to check the collocations in their own writing to see if they are correct.We can get students to research the context in which different collocations would be used.I hope you find Just-The -Words useful and think of lots more uses for it.

You can then click on any word within the web to explore the relationships to that word and so on. If you hover your mouse over the 'nodes' that connect the words you can also get a definition for the word relationship.One of the great things about the site is that you can save each web as an image with a single click, so you can use the images in your teaching materials.

{"title": "Instant back channel chat room", "date": "Wednesday 26 October 2011", "text": "I've been using back channels in my training and conference work for quite a while now and I'm getting to the stage where I wonder how I ever got by without them.A back channel a means of enabling text based collaboration among the people in your class / talk and this is usually done by using some form of chat room that people attending the class can log into during the session.There are a lot of advantages to this:It facilitates greater participation and knowledge sharing. Participants are able to share what they know with each other on the topic you are talking about.You can use it as an audience response tool get students to write in and share their responses. You can pass links to websites that students can then just click and open, so you don't have students trying to type or copy long URLs. You can also pass links to worksheets that students can download.The back channel is a great tool for students to base their notes from the session on. they just need to copy the interaction and all the links into a file. My main tool has been TodaysMeet, but I have recently discovered a new one that could be worth trying.It's called SimpleMeet.Me and it was designed for meeting collaboration. It has an advantage over TodaysMeet in that you can upload and share a document through it. So this could be useful for sharing your presentation or the aims of the class etc.It's very simple to use, just go to http://www.simplemeet.me and the site instantly produces the chat room for you and gives you a code to share. You then simply tell your students what the code is and they can go to the site and join the meeting. Once you are in the meeting you put in your name at the top and can then start to chat at the bottom. Your shared file appears bottom right (I've uploaded my CV as an example). You can have a look in the chat room I've created here Another nice feature of SimpleMeet.Me is that you can just enter your email address at the end of the chat and get a transcription of the complete discourse sent to you.If you work in a computer lab or wireless environment and you want to encourage your students to bring along laptops and mobile devices and participate in your lessons, then SimpleMeet.Me is a really useful tool. Personally, I have found that using a back channel in this way has transformed the way I teach and enabled me to completely do away with using any kind of paper handouts in class - so no more photocopying. It's also reduced the amount of wasted time struggling with students misspelling URLs and increased engagement during the classes. Of course the catch is that you have to work in an environment where your students have access to the Internet in class.I hope you give this a try and your students enjoy it.Related links: Tap into the Backchannel in Your Presentation3 Tools for Exploiting the Wifi During PresentationsCrowdsourcing Knowledge with Students Create a Video Q&A BoothSo Ask Me a Question Create Video QuestionnairesCreating Social Polls and Questionnaires Using Urtak Pros and Cons as Web Based Research Tasks 10 Tech Tools for Teacher Training Courses BestNik Peachey"},

You type these into the field on the top left of your screen.  If you play through the video and pause at specific moments, the question will appear at that point in the video.The last thing you need to do is to share the video by clicking on the 'Share this page' button. This will give you a URL that you can share with your students.Then when students play the video the questions will appear below it as they watch. They will be able to answer the questions and add their own.Lastly, as a bonus if you click on 'Moderate Q&A on this video' at the bottom of the page, you can create play lists, moderate submissions to the Q&A and even get an embed code to add the tasks to other materials.All really simple and done in just a few minutes. Of course the difficult part is getting the right video and choosing good questions.What I like about itThis is a great way to create interaction around a video clipIt's really quick and easy to create a taskStudents can access it from home or anywhere elseStudents can add their own questionsGreat to time questions to specific points in the videoIt's a nice clean interface with few distractionsYou can set up your own playlists and moderate themIt even has an embed code to add the tasks to other materialsGrockit is a great free tool for creating online interaction that's social and communicative.

{"title": "Creating Texting Dialogues for Students", "date": "Friday 14 October 2011", "text": "As mobile phone use becomes ubiquitous around the world and texting becomes a new genre of communication, it seems increasingly important that we as language teachers engage with these devices and help students to deal with the impact they are having on the English language.Some time ago I wrote about a texting language translater called Transl8it which enabled users to trans late short texts from standard English to something approaching sms texting language.  Since then I've used the site quite a lot to:Translate text for using in chat rooms such as TodaysMeetTranslate poems and short dialogues into texting language for students to readTranslate news headlines.I've also tried getting students to record example sentences of vocabulary into texting language, just to add an extra element to creating vocabulary records.Recently, I have also found a handy tool called ifaketext and this enables you to create a picture of a smartphone screen with your dialogue on. Here's an example:This is a great way to create materials to use with students, especially if we combine it with the Transl8it. Then I can make dialogues that look like this:All we need to do to create the dialogues is go to: ifaketext.com and type in a dialogue. Be sure to put a name at the top and format the dialogue with the name of each speaker followed by a colon (:) then the dialogue. Then just click on 'Create Your Screenshot'.Once the screen shot is created you get a number of options for adding it to materials. You can either get a code to embed it or a direct link to the image and you can save it from there and add it to you documents.Here are a few ways you could use this with students:Convert dialogues from their coursebook into texting language.Create mysterious interactions and get them to predict the context.Create dialogues and get students to guess the relationship between the people. Create the beginnings of dialogues and get the students to continue them.Create dialogues with missing lines / words and get the students to complete them.Create dialogues with the responses in the wrong order and get students to arrange them correctly.This is one small way that we can start to adapt materials and incorporate this kind of language into a our classroom. I hope you and your students enjoy using ifaketext and transl8it and you create some interesting and motivating materials for them.Related links:3 Tools for Exploiting the Wifi During Presentations  Questioning the Role of Technology in EducationiPad Apps for English Language Teachers AudioBoo to Posterous: Audio Podcasting from the Classroom Survey Results: Mobile learning for ELT BestNik Peachey"},
{"title": "Can you replace your IWB with a $10 dollar app?", "date": "Friday 7 October 2011", "text": "Idea Flight Enterprise is a new idea that makes a first attempt at using iPads to replace both the expensive IWB and the data projectors in your classroom.In many ways it's a great idea that centres around using a $10 (£7)  iPad (Pilot) app to share materials and interact with a classroom full of students.Students will also need iPads and to download a free (passenger) app so that they can view the lesson materials and make notes on them.The 'pilot' or teacher can open their PDF course materials and take students through them page by page in step allowing students to make notes on the materials as they go. They can also 'unlock' the materials which will allow students to move backwards or forwards through the materials independently at their own pace.The Idea Flight Enterprise app ensures that the teacher and students are all seeing the same materials and so this negates the necessity for both IWB and data projector (Though it is possible to plug the iPad into a data projector too if you require that)The app runs through either the wireless connection (with up to 14 students) or through connecting the iPads by Bluetooth (with up to 3 students).This looks like it could be a really good product for schools with small classes / classrooms, especially those teaching business English or very modern schools who want to experiment with class sets of iPads.What I like about Idea FlightAssuming that students already have iPads, buying a $10 app could save you the price of both a data projector and an IWB.It would be ideal for teaching small classes or one to one classes off-site, especially when there is no internet connection as you can connect through bluetooth.It synchronizes with your DropBox public folder so it's easy to upload your materials if you have a free account.It allows schools to create their own course materials using PPT, Keynote or Word and publish them as eBooks in PDF format for their students.Students can make notes on the materials and then store their own copy.Running materials through iPads rather than desktop or laptops enables your students to still be pretty mobile within the classroom, so you can still easily move them around and regroup them for discussion and human interaction within the classroom.The app has 'Linkedin' integration so new students can see each others profiles etc and find out about one another more easily, so this also makes it a great networking tool.What I wasn't so sure aboutIn the PDF materials I used in the app, all the hyperlinks were dead, so it would be nice if linking out to other materials were possible through the app.The app only runs on iPad which makes it a bit restrictive. It would be nice to see integration with the web, so that students with laptops or other tablets could also be included in the same class.I didn't try the app with video embedded into PDF so it would be nice to know if that worked, but I'm assuming it's unlikely.Classes of 15 students on wireless or 3 on bluetooth, make the use of this app pretty much restricted to private or very privileged classrooms, so it would be nice to see greater numbers of students made possible.It would be really good if a broader range of formats could be imported into the app. At present, any animations or effects that can be created with presentation software are lost when the materials are exported to PDF.Despite some of the weaknesses of this Idea Flight Enterprise, I still think it's a massive step in the right direction towards enabling greater use of these kinds of devices in the classroom and, at $10, making that step an economical choice and one that is a better fit for an interactive communicative classroom than something like and IWB and data projector.If you are thinking of introducing iPads within your school environment, and especially if you are developing your courses and course materials in-house, then I definitely think Idea Flight Enterprise is worth investigating.Here's their short promotional video showing how it works.This is an independent review that was written at the request of one of my sponsors - Idea Flight Enterprise - What I have written was in no way influenced or edited by them.I hope you find it useful.Related Links:Questioning the Role of Technology in EducationiPad Apps for English Language Teachers AudioBoo to Posterous: Audio Podcasting from the Classroom Survey Results: Mobile learning for ELT How to Make Your Own Pronunciation Flashcards Best Nik Peachey"},

{"title": "Questioning the Role of Technology in Education", "date": "Monday 16 May 2011", "text": "Over the last six months I have been involved in a project with Delta Publishing on their development blog as a guest author to produce a series of postings which question the role of technology and how it is applied in ELT and education in general. This has been a bit of a new departure for me because I usually focus on very practical articles and tend to avoid getting into the sometimes lengthy debates that surround technology with ELT.I'm now coming to the end of this series for a while and so I thought I would collect together these postings and some thoughts on what I've learned from the interaction with the various teachers who have responded to these posts.Here you can see a short video I created to introduce the series.Here you can find a brief summary and link to each article.ELT and the Crisis in EducationIn this first article I tried to put ELT into the greater context of general education and what is  being described by some as the 'Crisis in education'. I often think that ELT is viewed and views itself in isolation from what is happening elsewhere in education. I used a social questionnaire to encourage readers to reflect on their beliefs and compare them with those of other readers.ELT and the Crisis in Education – Part 2In this article I tried to highlight and share some of the reading and viewing that had influenced my own thinking about the problems that education faces today and the kinds of changes we need to make.ELT and the Crisis in Education: Technology in the ClassroomIn this article I tried to examine what I believe are some of the mistakes that have been made in our attempts to overlay technology onto our existing classroom design.ELT and the Crisis in Education: Digital LiteracyIn this article I tried to examine the role of digital literacy within ELT and highlight the importance of improving our understanding of what digital literacy is and how and why we should integrate it into our course design.ELT and the Crisis in Education: Digital Reading SkillIn this article I tried to examine the way receptive skills and the demands on 'readers' of web based content differed from the traditional reading skills we develop with our students.It’s time to change the way we test our studentsIn this article I tried to examine the role of testing and its negative impact on the potential of ELT to move forward and become more innovative.Breaking down the walls of the classroomIn this article I tried to examine the way that technology could be applied to course work to extend learning beyond the walls of the classroom and support a more blended and autonomous approach to the use of technology in ELT.Some Pros and Cons of iPads for ELTIn this article I tried to examine the potential of iPads and tablet style devices  within the classroom context and look at the way course books and published materials could be enhanced to make digital course books much more interactive and communicative.The worst thing about educational technology is educational technologyIn this article I tried to look at some of the worst aspects of our fixation with 'hardware' and the problems caused by misguided spending on complex gadgets without funding the support to make these work.Is the 140 character ‘micro interaction’ enough?In this article I tried to look at our tendency to be obsessed with 'the latest thing' and how this often limits view of what is potentially available to us. I tried to particularly focus on a contrast between microblogging and 3D game playing in virtual worlds.Augmented Reality and Web 3.0In one of my last posts I speculated about what could be the next step in terms of the way the Internet is developing and I had a brief look at how this could potentially impact on ELT.Survey: Mobile Learning in ELT 2011My final post will be a write up of some research I have been doing into mobile learning. This will be a follow up to some research that I published a year ago into the use of mobile learning devices in ELT.I'd like to thank all the people who have left comments and questions on the articles and especially I would like to thanks everyone at Delta Publishing for sponsoring this series and leaving me absolutely free to say whatever I want.I hope you enjoy reading them.BestNik Peachey"},

You can then click on any of the country names below to get statistical comparisons between your own country and the one you have selected.The comparisons are actually colour rated according to whether they are viewed as negative, positive or neutral aspects.If you click at the end of each comparison you can also get more information about the facts being presented.At the bottom of the page there is voting button where you can choose which of the two countries you would prefer to live in.Once you click to choose the country you would prefer you can leave a comment to say why and also read other comments.Here are some ways I think you could use this site with students.Get them to find a country they would prefer to live in and ask them to find 5 reasons to justify.Get students to find a country they would NOT prefer to live in and ask them to justify.Select two countries and ask students to choose one to live in and justify their choice.Ask students to look at the colour rating of the facts and see if the agree with the positive / negative rating of the facts.Ask them to compare a number of different countries and find out which is the most environmentally sound / destructive.Ask students to compare a number of countries and find out which has the best quality of life (They will need to decide what the criteria are for this).Ask students to decide which of the facts displayed would influence their choice of country most.Ask students to look at the facts that are compared and decide which important facts they feel are missing.Ask students to look at some of the comments about the countries and decide - which they agree with / disagree with, which they think are ridiculous.Ask students to compare their country to a number of others then post a comment or ask a questions about each country.Get students to find the comments about their own country and respond to one of them ( in a polite way)Ask students to look at the site and try to decide who constructed it and why.Ask students to look at the facts about their country and decide if they think they are accurate.I hope you find IfItWereMyHome and these activities useful.

It arrived with a real wave of hype and disappeared just as quickly, but it seems that many of the 'gadgets' designed to work with Wave have survived and can now be used independently within a service called Google Shared Spaces.There are lots of these small gadgets so I decide to have a look at some and see if they had any potential for use in language learning.Here are examples of some of the more useful ones.Wave TubeHere you can add a Video from YouTube to a page and students can watch it and leave comments or ask questions using the chat box on the left.Try this one: http://goo.gl/AXEFYYes/ No / MaybeThis is a simple gadget for creating single question polls that your students can then answer and add comments to.Try this one: http://goo.gl/UQvGzyourBrainstormerThis is a nice brainstorming gadget that enables you to create mind maps around a topic. Students can actually vote for or against the elements they like too.Try this one: http://goo.gl/StD9eListyThis is a nice tool for creating 'to do' lists. Anyone can add to the list of things to do and then tick them off as they are done.Try this one: http://goo.gl/UVbjUMagnetic Fridge PoetryThis is a nice tool for creating jumbled text activities. You just add your text when you create your board and then students can drag the words around wherever they want them.Try this one: http://goo.gl/nCigpThese are just a few of the interactions you can create with the Shared Spaces. There are lots more, so why not try a few out, feel free to play with the ones I've created and let me know which ones work for you.Related links:Create Image BooksMicrosoft's free Learning Content Development SystemInteractive multiple choice activitiesCreating an interactive cloze textCreate Quick Interactive ActivitiesHow to Make a Word Search Puzzle for your BlogCloze Test Creation ToolBestNik Peachey"},

It enable you to  create and print your own flashcards which include text, phonemic script  and images that you can type in and add. You can then use these for a  range of activities in the classroom.To create flashcards, the first thing you do is go to:  http://www.cambridgeenglishonline.com/Flashcard_maker/ and choose the  size of the flashcards you want to create. you can choose from either  one A4 size card to 8 cards per A4 sheet.Next, you can either draw your own image or select one from the image library.To add an image you just click on the name of the image you want from the image library and click 'Apply' and it appears on the flashcard.Next you can add your text and lastly, use the small phonemic typewriter to add the symbols.Then all you have to do is click on print and you have your flashcard with phonemic script.This is a great tool to use with EFL and ESL students.You can create simple flashcards with images and phonemic script of the nouns.You can get the students to create the flash cards themselves, as the phonemic typewriter also has sound so they can hear the phonemes as they type them.You can create some cards with just images, some with just word and some with just script and create a great matching activity.You can create flashcards with pronunciation mistakes and see if the students can spot them. You can create flashcards with one image and two different phonemic spellings and see if students can say the correct one.If you really like this and think it's useful, there is even a version for iPad / iPhone which has lots of activities built in along with the ability for students to record and compare their own audio of their pronunciation. The app version isn't free though I'm afraid, but it is quite cheap at £1.79 in the UK.

{"title": "A Tool for Helping Students Develop More Complex Sentences", "date": "Tuesday 11 January 2011", "text": "A couple of years ago I wrote an activity for students called Extending a Sentence which used a Flash animated website to show how a simple sentence could be elaborated to become rich in detail. The site called Telescopictext had a marvelous sentence which started with 'I made tea' and developed into a full paragraph, just click on the grey words.I'm glad to say that this site has now been developed so that everyone can create and save their own sentences. Here's my first one and it starts,\"Telescopic text is great.\"Creating your own text is really easy and if you register you can save the text and get a hyperlink to it. The first thing to do is to go to http://www.telescopictext.org/ and register. Then once you have logged in, click on 'Write'.You can then start by adding a very short sentence. Then click the 'Start' button.You can then add more words by slicking on a word, adding more detail and then clicking 'Insert'.You can keep clicking on words and adding more parts to the sentence. If you click on the small magnifying icon at the bottom right of the screen you will also be able to see the structure of the sentence as it has been developed.If you click on 'Fold' you'll be able to close the phrase up and then try it out by clicking on the word to expand it again.When you think the sentence is finished, you just need to click on  'Publish' and after a few quick checks you'll be able to get a URL to share with your students.Here's the one I just made: I went to class.I think this is a great tool to use with students.You can put students in pairs with a starter sentence and get them to keep taking it in turns to add parts.You can see which students can create the longest single sentence without any grammar mistakes.You can put in short texts your students have created then get them to edit and make them more interesting.You can create a text with mistakes in and the corrections hidden, then just click to show what the mistakes are. Students can try to predict what the correction will be before you show it.You could create  also a create a version with some errors hidden and some visible and students have to decide which one are genuine errors and which are actually correct.You can give students a starter sentence and get them to create short story around it by gradually building up the sentences.You can use 'View Structure' feature to highlight the way the sentence is formed and the different parts of speech etc.I think Telescopictext is a wonderful tool to use with students either on a data projector / IWB in class or to get them creating sentences at home. I hope you find it useful.Related links:More than 120 web based activities for studentsTechnology in the classroom5 Tasks to Teach Yourself to Teach with TechnologyRevising Short Texts and Syntax on IWBBestNik Peachey"},

The site has a huge collection of questions that people have sent in about various aspects of English grammar idioms and general usage and anyone who is registered can the try to answer the questions.I think this would be a great tool to use with trainee teachers. They could find questions and check to see if the agree with the answers. They could also post their own questions and answers. It's also a great way to test your ability to answer thorny questions that might come up.If you are looking for questions related to a particular aspect you can search through the tags to the side and click on any that interest you.For me this is a great way to approach the development of grammatical knowledge ( I find attempting to read grammar books impossible).

Better still students could find there own songs and copy the lyrics into the cloze test creator so that they create their own personalised activities.Batlyrics is free to use, but it does carry quite a lot of advertising though so be careful where you click.I hope you find Batlyrics useful.

You can either go to their website and start recording straight away, or you can download a free app either to your Apple device or Android smart phone.The site really does enable almost single click publishing once you have registered and set up your profile, but better than this it can be synced with a Twitter account, Facebook profile or blogging account so that any materials you record go directly to your network.Publish directly from the classroomI've found this really useful, particularly as I have the app installed on my iPad. This means that I can wander round class recording my students and then click a button and have their recordings published directly to my blog with seconds.Then I can go to the blog later and build review tasks around the materials or students can go to the blog pages and comment on each others' recordings.Here you can see and hear what the result is when you publish direct to Posterous: My first AudioBoo to Posterous recording from iPadWith studentsHaving this ability to instantly record and publish students' speaking can be very powerful, particularly when using a task based approach, as students are often reluctant to review and repeat speaking tasks that they have already done once. However, knowing that their speaking will be recorded and published gives them the extra motivation to repeat tasks, focus on what they have learned and concentrate on achieving a level of accuracy.Setting all this up is very simple. Once you have your Posterous blog account, register on the AudioBoo website, create your profile then go to settings and click on 'Post to other sites'. There you can decide which services you want to synchronise your AudioBoo account with. Then you just start recording and publishing.AudioBoo and Posterous together can help you to build a powerful and versatile publishing platform for your students work and they are both free, so why not give them a try.I hope you find them useful.

This is a great way to get students checking  paired sentences with their common mistakes against against each other. Also great for getting them to check collocations to check that they have the correct combinations of words or how popular different collocations are.What's also nice about the site is that it shows you the context in which it found the examples, so students can reinforce their learning by seeing some examples of the phrase used correctly in context.

{"title": "iPad Apps for English Language Teachers", "date": "Sunday 7 November 2010", "text": "Well like a lot of people I’ve bought an iPad over the summer and I’ve been having my first taste of shopping for apps to extend the capabilities of the iPad. I’ve also been having a look at how some of these can be used for language learning, so I thought I would share with you a little bit of information about the first few apps I’ve tried.ForvoFor those of you who don’t know Forvo, it’s a marvelous pronunciation dictionary site which is collecting together audio examples of of the pronunciation of different words from languages and speakers all round the world.The app works as a simple pronunciation dictionary which you can carry with you in class and whenever a new word comes up, you can get an example pronunciation form it. For many of the more common words in English you can get multiple examples from different speaker (male, female, UK, US, Australian etc.)The app could be really handy for use in class, especially if you aren’t confident about your own pronunciation or your students want to study a particular accent. The app runs on iPhone or iPad. You’ll need to have a connection to download the pronunciation examples and unfortunately there isn’t any capability to record and upload your own examples (you’ll need to go to the website to do that), but it’s still a pretty useful tool.It isn’t free, but it’s pretty cheap and you can download it from: http://itunes.apple/forvo-pronunciation/Dragon DictationThis app is from the makers of the popular Dragon voice recognition software and as you would expect it is designed to recognise your words and transcribe them as text. It works pretty well too, though it does make some mistakes which you then have to correct. You can correct the errors by typing in the corrections or tapping the surface where the error is and trying to say the words again.This would be a good way to get students working on their speaking skills and correcting errors in text. It’s also a very handy tool if you don’t like typing a lot as once you have created a text on it you can either copy or send it by email or post it straight to Facebook or Twitter. You don’t need a connection to use the voice recognition part, but you’ll need to be connected to share your texts. It also works best if you have an external microphone for your device.Dragon Dictation is also free http://itunes.apple/dragon-dictation/Mobile Air MouseThis is a really clever little app that transforms your iPad, iPod or iTouch into a remote touch pad controller and keyboard for your computer. That might not seem like such a big deal, but what it means is that once you have the free software installed on the main computer in your classroom, any student that has Air Mouse on their mobile device can take control of the computer, write or draw on the board and interact with your learning materials without leaving their seat.This duplicates a lot of the functions of an interactive whiteboard and slate, so it might also save some  money. There’s a free version and a pro version. The app runs through your wireless connection.Air Mouse: http://itunes/air-mouse-free-remote-trackpad/FlipboardFlipboard is my favourite app so far. It is a type of feed reader for the iPad. The really great thing about Flipboard though is that it converts the feeds into a magazine type format that you can then easily browse. This is particularly useful for feeds from things like Twitter, which can be very reader unfriendly and I’m now getting a lot more information a lot quicker from Twitter than I previously was using a desktop based app.So this is a great app for keeping up with your PLN as well as finding images and text to use in class. Flipboard is also free, so that’s another big bonus, but you will need a connection while you are using it.Flip Board: http://ax.itunes/flipboard/Here’s a video showing how it works:MeeGeniusThis is an app that has been developed to support the website (or could it be the other way around) MeeGenius contains a collection of illustrated books for primary level kids. The books have audio accompaniment and words are highlighted as the kids listen.Great to get younger learners reading and listening in English. The app isn’t free but it’s very reasonable priced (especially compared to buying the books) and it contains 12 free books 6 of which are ready installed and 6 more that you need a connection to download. If you want more books after that you can buy more.You can find out more about the app from: http://www.meegenius.com/iphoneSonicPicsThis is a handy app that allows you to add audio to images or sequences of images and then export them as video files. There is a free version that allows you to create videos of up to three images and 10 mins recording time, or you can buy the pro version and make unlimited sequences. This is really handy for grabbing screen shots from your iPad or iPhone and adding audio to them or for adding audio to photographs.Describing pictures and images is a handy way of getting students to practice their speaking and the videos can then be exported for sharing.SonicPics: http://itunes/sonicpics-lite/I hope you find some of these apps useful, and if you don't yet have an iPad, I hope they give you some idea of the enormous potential that these tools have.Related linksSurvey Results: Mobile learning for ELTRecord Online WebCam Interviews with WetokuDownloading Online videoRecording Skype CallsBubble Joy for Thanks GivingBestNik Peachey"},

The survey also collected information about the teachers’ existing access to mobile services and the kinds of device they are using to get access to mobile Internet.The survey was carried out during June and July of 2010. The survey was answered by over 500 English language teachers.The results of this survey were collected online using a web based survey site called SurveyMonkey.com. The online survey was distributed through:My Twitter Network (3k teachers world wide)The British Council’s ELTeCS list (15k teachers world wide)A number of email based ELT discussion lists (these are long established lists from around the world. They are teaching rather than technology focused)The respondents are likely to be early technology adopters as they are mostly people who are already involved in some form of online teaching network. However the majority of the networks used to distribute the survey were not focused on the use or discussion of technology in teaching, but are mainly forum to discuss mainstream teaching.You can access the complete survey results at: http://tinyurl.com/3ayyhnbYou can download the tabulated data with a brief analysis and summary from: Technogogy.org.ukI hope you find this information useful.

I bought it for about 2 euros and it works pretty effectively. You still have to download each book before you read it, so this is best done on a wireless connection (so you aren't paying mobile rates) but it is then stored on your device until you want to read it.The site and the app are really good recommendations for parents if you want to advise them on how to support their kids learning development and help them to read with the kids.I hope you find MeeGenius useful.Related links:3D Computer Games with Young LearnersGet Rid of Embarrassing AdsBring Your Kids Drawings to LifeA Web Browser Designed for KidsA Virtual Language Learning World for KidsBestNik Peachey"},

As many of you probably already know, the issue of migration will be one that is and will continue to have huge impact on our societies over the next few decades and dealing with this effectively is going to be of key importance.Language is of course a huge issue for anyone moving to another country and so it seems appropriate that the materials, information and images from the project be exploited for their language learning potential, as well as the potential they have to inform, enlighten  and open up discussion about what can be a very sensitive issue.Here are links to some of the materials.Who is it?This activity contains audio, script and images of real people who migrated to Dublin. The students find out about some of the real people and have to imagine the lives of some of the others to build up a profile.Image by Veronica Vierin www.ctmp.ieActivity: Who is it?The challenges of being a migrantThis is a speaking and listening activity that involves students in thinking about the kinds of problems and challenges they might face as a migrant going to Belfast. They then listen to the true stories of 5 migrants talking about the challenges they have faced and this is made more real for students because these are genuine stories and the materials include images of the real people.Activity: The challenges of being a migrantArtists as immigrantsPeople’s ideas of what an immigrant to their country is and the kinds of work they do can often be very stereotyped, so in this activity I’ve tried to confront those stereotypes by using images of different kinds of artists all of whom are migrants to Dusseldorf. The students have to imagine they are one of the people and try to see the experience of migrating from their perspective.Images by Liza Nguyen www.liza-nguyen.comActivity: Artists as immigrantsThese are just a few of the activities I’ve created and there should be some more on the way soon.

{"title": "Future of Educational Technology 3: Augmented Reality and ELT", "date": "Wednesday 2 June 2010", "text": "In this article I want to have a quick look at Augmented Reality and what potential it holds for the future of English language teaching.What’s Augmented Reality?Basically, augmented reality can be defined as the interweaving of virtual Internet based materials with or physical reality. This still sounds a bit vague, so let me take this a step further. Virtual reality works with the aid of GPS (Global Positioning System) type mobile devices which are able to accurately track your physical location and they deliver to your mobile device information from the Internet which is specific to that location.Image from SndrvBy specific to that location, I don’t mean that if you are in London you get information about London. It’s much more specific than that. You can be tracked through your mobile device to the exact square metre on which you are standing and the information can be delivered about exactly what, or potentially who you are looking at from moment to moment.You can see a simple video explaining augmented reality here: Augmented RealityMost virtual reality applications at the moment are being delivered through mobile phones with cameras on, so when you hold up your mobile phone and point the camera in any direction you can see information about the things around you on your phone screen  and click on the screen to get more information.Image from PetaPixel article on AR apps for HistoryOne marvelous example of how this can be applied is a free virtual reality App for the iPhone called Streetmuseum which has been developed by The Museum of London. It enables users walking around the streets of London to hold up their phone and get a 2D or even 3D image overlay of what that street would have looked like at some point during history.Augmented reality in 3D can also be applied to books. You can experience this on your computer now if you have a web cam and a printer. Just follow this link to Ecomagination at http://ge.ecomagination.com, print up a simple piece of paper and follow the instructions. You’ll see a 3D animated model with sound and movements that you can actually interact with appear in front of you on your screen.Think about how this simple piece of paper if applied to the pages of a book, could transform the experience of reading and the relationship of text to images.How will Augmented Reality impact on teaching and learning?It means that we can take learning out of the classroom and deliver it to exactly where and when students need it. 3D interactive learning materials can be delivered to students on the spot at the supermarket, train station, bank whenever they need it just through an app in their mobile phone camera.Not only this but the ability of GPS to accurately track location means that you can track other users of the same app, so that if you walked into a room full of people anywhere in the world and held up your camera you would be able to see information about those people, find out which were teachers or learners of English and have your face to face lesson, or peer to peer study group with anyone and anywhere you happened to be when you had the time.So virtual reality applications have the potential to transform our social and learning reality. They have the potential to transform the way we read and interact with text. They have the potential to transform the way and the places where we teach and the relationship between teachers and learners.Is this something we want? Do we want to be tracked by the Internet where ever we go? Well the fact is, that if you have a GPS enabled mobile device with you right now and it’s switched on, then this is already happening to you.As for how we as teachers deal with this and the uses it’s put to in education, that still remains to be seen, but this is happening now and we need to be aware of and start thinking about how we want this to impact on our lives and work.Related links:Future of Educational Technology 2: The Web CamFuture of Educational Technology 1: The Digital DivideLet us Now Praise Famous WomenTechnology newsThe Web 2.0 School of the PresentSocial Networks and the Web 2.0 Revolution: Part 2BestNik Peachey"},
{"title": "Image Based Speaking Activity for IWB", "date": "Sunday 30 May 2010", "text": "This is a quick image based speaking activity that any teacher with an IWB or just a data projector in their classroom can do.It's based around a photographic portfolio site by photographer Scott Stulberg. Scott's site opens directly to a slide show of some of his fantastic images.The slides change at the rate of about 1 every 4 seconds and the sequence seems to be pretty much the same each time you go to the site. Here you can see Scott's imagesSo what's the activity?It's very simple tell your students to watch the image slide show. After about 10 - 15 images, close the site and put your students in pairs and try to get them to brainstorm as many of the images as they can remember. This should get them talking and describing the images to each other.Once they have had some time to talk and remind each other, get some feedback from the class and try to get them to describe as many of the images as they can remember to you. Help them with any vocabulary they may be struggling with.Next, ask them if they can remember the order of the images. Which one was first etc? Put them in pairs once again to discuss again and try to remember the order.Next, play the slide show again and get the students to check the order. When the slide show is finished. Get the students to once again tell you the order of the slides.In the next lesson, ask the students again to try to recall and describe in pairs as many of the images as they can remember from the previous lesson. You could use some vocabulary words, especially the new words that came out of the lesson as prompts.If you want to follow this up by getting some more static images to get students to describe in more detail, then be sure to check the index, as there are lots more images there.I've always found images to be a very powerful tool for helping students to remember vocabulary and descriptive words. I hope you find this activity useful.Find more: image based activities for EFL / ESL studentsRelated links:Creating multimedia storiesA Picture's worthPicture phrasesPersonalised flashcardsExploiting Image SequencesBestNik Peachey"},

Either you can send a book to the company and they say they will digitize it for free, you can upload an existing digital copy and it will be converted on the site, or you can use the WYSIWYG interface to write straight into the site.I tried uploading my Web 2.0 Tools for Teachers manual from the PDF format and this is what it came out like. You can download it from here if you are lucky enough to have an iPad Web 2.0 Tools for Teachers iPad editionThe process of uploading it was pretty simple. Once you are registered you just click on 'Upload', locate the file in the usual way and click again to upload it. Once the file is uploaded, it takes a short while to convert it to the format for iPad.When it has been converted the status will change from 'unprocessed' to 'Converted to ePub'. You can then share the link with anyone who wants to read your materials or book on their iPad. You can set privacy status on the file and add tabs and index it. You can even edit the file once it's uploaded using the on site WYSIWYG.This is a great way to convert content for use on the iPad. It doesn't have to be books of course, you could also use it for worksheets, or notes for your students or books or stories they have created themselves.It's also worth checking out the books that are already there too as there is quite a collection. The focus seems to be mainly on children's books at the moment. Have a look in the 'browse' section and see if anything takes your fancy.Now all you need is an iPad!Related links:Free ebooks on elearningFree Web Publishing CommunityFantastic Free E-Books for EFL and ELTBestNik Peachey"},
{"title": "Ask & Answer Video Questions", "date": "Thursday 20 May 2010", "text": "Much as I don't like appearing on video I do like web based video tools and Plank.ly is one that caught my eye recently. Plank.ly is an asynchronous Q&A site which allows users to ask and answer each other's questions either by text or video.It's very easy to use, you just need a webcam and to set up your account. Once you have done that you can integrate it with Twitter or Facebook (though I would advise that you wait to see how useful it is first) and you can start inviting friends or students to follow you and invite them to leave questions for you. It's a good idea to get started by getting Plank.ly to ask you a few random questions, so that when visitors come there is something for them to see. This is very simple to  do. Once you have created your account, go to the 'Inbox' and click on 'Ask yourself a random question'.Once the questions appears, you can answer it either using text or video, just by clicking the icon on the right.Clicking the video icon will launch the video recorder window. You'll need to click on 'Allow' so that the Flash plug in can access your camera and microphone.Then you just click on 'Record' and start recording your answer to the question. You can try again if you don't get it right first time so don't worry too much. If you like your recording, just click on 'Use' .All of your video answers are collected in your 'Activity stream'so you can go back and edit or delete them later.The next thing to do is either start inviting friends through Twitter or Facebook, or if you prefer just send the URL of your stream to people who you want to ask you questions. The they can either submit a questions by text or record a video questions for you. You can see my stream and try it at: http://plank.ly/NikPeacheyThe activity stream is a little like Twitter in that you can start to follow people or they can follow you, so you can start asking and answering each other's questions and see what questions other people have been asked.How to use this with studentsI think this is a great 'ice-breaker' especially for an online class where students don't really get to meet each other and are often working in different time zones.It's also a great way for lower levels to get some online speaking practice for homework and the fact that they record their answers will be interesting when they come to look back on their progress. Also great for you to help assess their progress too.It's also a nice way for new classes to get to know you as their teacher. This can be really difficult in bigger classes with lots of students, so this can add a nice element of 1 - 1 contact.Questions and answers are the fundamental building blocks of language, so this is a great tool for checking out students' grammar and their ability to formulate questions and answers in any particular tense, so great online controlled speaking practice too.Potential problemsThis is an open site, so students can be 'found' by other people, so think about what age groups you use the site with. If you are following the students, however, you will be able to see who they are interacting with and as all accounts are registered you will be able to track back any bullying or abuse that may happen.I hope you enjoy using this with students and by all means do leave me a question if you want to and I'll do my best to answer it. http://plank.ly/NikPeacheyRelated links:Create Quick Video Task SheetsCropping YouTube Videos to Create ActivitiesQuick Twitter Video Activity20 WebCam Activities for EFL ESL StudentsSending Bubble Joy to your EFL / ESL StudentsAnimated Music Videos for EFL Creating multimedia stories12 Second Video Clips for EFL ESLTutorial: Using Videos from YouTubeGreat Video Commenting ToolBestNik Peachey"},
{"title": "Collaborative Text Editing Tool", "date": "Wednesday 12 May 2010", "text": "If you have ever seen PrimaryPad or EtherPad, then Sync.in will probably look quite familiar. It's an online collaborative text editing tool, that allows multiple users to work on the same text synchronously.It's very simple to use, you just click on the 'Create a New Public Note' button and it launches the text editor and gives your text a unique URL. You then just click on 'Share this Note' to send your URL to any of a number of different social networks or by email.Once visitors click the link they can start editing the text. The edits of each visitor are colour coded and they can even communicate with each other while they edit by using the text chat window that opens by the side of the document.It isn't clear exactly how many visitors can work on the same text (PrimaryPad supports groups of six) but having too many people working on the same text can often lead to chaos. Sync.in has very hand desktop launcher though, so you can create multiple pads and then get different groups of people using them, just by clicking on the 'New Note' button.One of the other interesting features is that you can use the 'Time Slider' feature to 'replay' the development of the text. This shows you how and who has developed the text, added and edited parts. This is a great way to track how much work each of your students did on the text.This is a really useful tool for a connected classroom or computer lab where you can get students developing texts and peer editing together. It's also great if you are running online courses and you want students to work together on  a text. I've also written about how it can be used within presentations to make them more interactive here: 3 Tools for Exploiting the Wifi During PresentationsI've added a pad below so you can click the link and try adding ideas  on how to use Sync.in and editing other people's ideas.

{"title": "Create Quick Interactive Activities", "date": "Sunday 9 May 2010", "text": "I've just been looking at this really useful tool for creating interactive close text activities  (300 words limit).The tool is produced by Nottingham University and can work with quite a range of languages, not only English.The first step is to grab a text you want to use with your students. I just grabbed the first couple of paragraphs of a BBC News Report. Paste the text into the field and select which type of words you want to remove. Then select the type of activity you want it to be. At present there are 3 choices:Drag and drop Fill in the blank Multiple choiceJust click the one you want and then click on 'Submit' and wait for your text to appear.The drag and drop activity works pretty well. The students see the words beneath the gapped text and drag them onto the gaps. If the words are correct, they turn blue and become part of the text, but if the are wrong, they turn red and return to their place.With the fill in the blanks activity the students see the gapped text and click on the gaps to type in the missing words. Again, correct word go blue and wrong words go red. The students can right click on the gap to get a first letter hint, or the solution.The multiple choice exercise is slightly more complicated, it generates a gapped text and then you have to right click on the gap to get the alternative choices to appear to the right of the screen. It's quite impressive that it generates its own credible alternative words for each gap, but when I tried to create an exercise that gapped multiple word types, it couldn't create the activity, so if you use this option just select one word type.This is a really useful tool for quickly creating activities for students. The down side is these activities can't be saved, so you either have to use the activities in class with an interactive whiteboard or data projector, or get students to work autonomously to create and complete their own activities. My advice would be to do a few in class to show the students how they work, then get them to create their own on their own computers.This is a great way to revise a text or to discover examples of particular structures in context. I like tat you can select to remove all numerals as this can be great for getting students to predict answers before reading for specific information.I hope you enjoy using this tool and find it useful.Related links:Cloze Test Creation ToolListening Dictation Puzzles for EFL ESLCreating an interactive cloze textMS Word tutorial 1: Adding ‘comments’Dictation goes Web 2.0Subtitling your video clipsTranscribed Videos for EFL ESLSoundscapes from SoundTransitBestNik Peachey"},
{"title": "Future of Educational Technology 2: The Web Cam", "date": "Tuesday 4 May 2010", "text": "In the first of these articles on the future of educational technology I had a quick look at the Digital Divide and how continually falling prices and improving standards could help to bridge the divide. In this second article I'd like to look at the developing role of the web cam.Video ConferencingSo how about the role of the humble web cam?  Web cams have been around for a while now, though they don’t tend to get used so much, though there is a lot of talk about telepresence. Telepresence is supposed to be video conferencing but with such good quality it seems like the person is in the same room with you. Here’s what it looks like.http://www.flickr.com/photos/av-1/3521310150/Looks pretty expensive doesn’t it? I can’t say I’m impressed by this. Having used very similar equipment (probably equally expensive) and tried to have discussions between two groups of people in different rooms, I have to say that even if the quality was great it would be far from ideal.Personally I feel that we can work just as well on our laptops with the built in web cam and a free tools like Tokbox.com. The quality that these services can offer is likely to improve over the coming years as they become more popular and attract more investment.http://www.flickr.com/photos/mortenjust/2209302906/Iris and Facial RecognitionBut how about this idea? Have you been through immigration at an airport recently. If you have you may have had your iris scanned as a means of identification. Suppose the technology that this system uses develops to the point where you can authenticate your identity on your computer through your web cam. So no more logging in and trying to remember user names and passwords to the sites you register on. Just sit in front of your computer and it knows who you are and unlocks all your sites and web based services for you. Possible? Useful?http://www.flickr.com/photos/fn-goa/169836309/Face recognition is also becoming more common place and you can now download free software for Windows ( http://www.luxand.com/blink/)that will recognise your face and log you into your computer, so no more forgotten passwords!Motion RecognitionMotion recognition through web cams is also making its way into games and there are already quite a few free games that you can try out using your web cam as the controller.Here you can stand in front of your web cam and take on a team of ninjas.http://www.iviewgames.com/ninja.htmlOr if you prefer something a bit safer then how about cleaning some windowshttp://www.iviewgames.com/cleaner.htmlBoth of these will keep you pretty fit as they involve quite a lot of jumping about.There are a lot more web cam controlled games available at:http://webcamgames.sky.com/ if you feel like investigating more.Well and what about your interactive whiteboard? What’s the connection between IWBs and web cams? Well your web cam could make the need for a specialised board and controller obsolete pretty soon if the guys at Camspace http://camspace.com/  have anything to do with it. They have been developing this system which turns any coloured object into a computer controller.If we start applying this kind of technology to IWB software it could mean that any students in your class could hold up a pen or any coloured object and take control of the computer and write on the board from where ever they are sitting. Giving this control to students could make that interactive whiteboard a lot more interactive and better still save a lot of money.So our web cam is not only the doorway to video conferencing and communication, it could soon also become a way of logging onto our computers and conforming our identity, a way  of interacting with our computer and a way of giving students control of the board and making their interaction with the computer as a class a lot more interactive.So that’s just a quick look at the part the humble web cam could play in the future of learning technology. I hope you enjoyed it and that it gives you some food for thought about the way technology can change the way we learn.Related links:Future of Educational Technology 1: The Digital DivideLet us Now Praise Famous WomenTechnology newsThe Web 2.0 School of the PresentSocial Networks and the Web 2.0 Revolution: Part 2BestNik Peachey"},
{"title": "Pros and Cons as Web Based Research Tasks", "date": "Wednesday 28 April 2010", "text": "I'm always looking for handy tools that students can use as follow up tasks to online research and Pro | Con Lists certainly looks like a good one.The site enables students to collect together the advantages and disadvantages of a particular subject and create a list of each to see how they balance out.Here's an example one on Solar EnergyAs you can see, at the top of the page is the list of pros and cons,and below it is the balance of the results.When creating the list students can also add to or reduce the influence of some factors and balance emotional and rational factors of each too.It sounds complicated, but these are very easy to produce. Just register and log in and go to 'Create a list'. Give the list a title, select the topic and add a description. You are then ready to start adding the pros and cons.Each of the pros and cons added has a default weight of 3 in both the emotional and rational settings, but students can click on the numbers to increase or decrease the weight if they think the pro or con is more or less significant.Once they have completed their lists they can publish them or share them through a range of social media platforms.Visitors to the lists can then leave comments or agree or disagree with each of the individual pros and cons in the list, simply by clicking on them and voting.To see how this works I've created a short Pro and Con list on the topic of Interactive Whiteboards. Feel free to comment and suggest more pros and cons.Pros and Cons of Interactive WhitebaordsI think Pro | Con Lists is a great way to follow up web based research activities and would work really well combined with something like Mashpedia.Students could go to the Mashpedia site and search for information on something like wind power, solar power or even different political parties or sporting teams, then use the information they find to create their list of pros and cons.Once the lists are created they could share them with other students and vote on whether they agree with the pros and cons.Students could also use the site to brainstorm pros and cons before they do research. This would get them thinking about the subject first and they could then look back at their own lists and see how they could change or modify them.What I really like about the site is that it gets students thinking and evaluating the power of their arguments too.It would be nice if the lists could be added to by visitors, but that doesn't seem to be possible, but I still think this is a really useful tool and one that can be used to create research based reading and listening tasks.I hope you like it and find it useful.Related links:Creating Social Polls and Questionnaires Using Urtak35 more reading tasksUsing Wise Quotes with EFL StudentsGet the News Through ImagesCreate Authentic Web Based Research Tasks With MashpediaSurvey Creation Tool for StudentsCreate Quick Online PollsCreate an ESL EFL Video QuizEducation for the Global EconomyBestNik Peachey"},
{"title": "Create Quick Video Task Sheets", "date": "Tuesday 27 April 2010", "text": "Vidinotes is an interesting site that I spotted a few weeks back. It's a great way to produce instant (almost) video worksheets to go with YouTube videos.Basically, what it does is to convert an flv video file into a number of screen shots with a space next to each screen shot for the students to take notes.I picked this silent video with sound track by Micheal Galasso as it has a very visually rich digital narrative and made a worksheet for it.To do this I first had to download the video as an flv file. I did this using the KeepVid site recommended by Vidinotes. Then you have to upload the flv clip to the Vidinotes site. This was pretty slow, but it will  depend a lot on the length of your clip and you can do other things while you wait for it to upload.Once the clip is uploaded start to play it and simply click the 'Capture' button when you see a frame you want in your worksheet.As you capture images they will appear on the right of the video. And you can either give each image a title or leave it blank. You have to give the worksheet a name though.Once you have captured all the images you want from the video (you can select up to 30) you simply click on 'Print' and you have your worksheet.You can use these worksheets for a range of activities and with a range of different video types.You could use them as prediction tasks before students watch the clip. Students could predict the story or what the characters will say.Students could try to write in what the characters are thinking at each stage of the clip.Students could use the worksheet to make notes of lectures or how to videos.Students could use them to summarise steps in a process being described.Students could describe the images from the video and build their own narrative or sets of instructions.Here are some example worksheets from the site. You can check these out and think about how you might use them with your students.Build a BristleBotHow to make sushi                 How to rave dance                 Ghetto workout moves                                                                                                                                                                   This is a great way to create simple and versatile video worksheets that won't take you too long.

{"title": "Create Authentic Web Based Research Tasks With Mashpedia", "date": "Thursday 15 April 2010", "text": "I've just discovered Mashpedia and I have to say I really like it. It's a combination of a search engine and an encyclopedia.  It's very simple to use, you just type in a search query and hit search.The site will then generate a page of information links about your search topic. It collects information from multiple media and different sources from books, blogs , text images to video and even Twitter references.Here's a couple of example pages I created, just click the titles to see the pages compile themselves.Learning technologyJimi HendrixLondon ZooBarcelonaThe European UnionThe OudThis is a great tool for creating reading and research tasks for students, based around authentic materials. It creates genuine web based reading tasks that demand that students assess clues to text content from multiple sources before exploring the links, then read or watch for gist to check relevance before reading / listening more deeply for specific information.The pages will always create similar though not identical content so don't create very specific reading and research tasks, make sure the tasks are general and more generic.Here are some possible reading / research tasks you could use which would work for most topics:Get students to look at the information and use it to create a quiz on the topic. They find information that interests them and write questions to quiz the rest of the class.Set students to find 5 - 10 facts about a topic. You could stipulate some of these need to be negative aspects and some positive to make it more challenging.Get students to search the page and decide which of the sources it links to is the single most informative or interesting.Get students to research a topic and create a multimedia poster about it using text, images and video embedded. You could use something like Glogster for them to show their results.Get students to research a topic and create a short documentary or news report about it. If you have access to a video camera you could video their presentations.Of course you still have to be careful with younger students as you can't control what comes in to the page, and also expect much less of lower level students and set them quite simple tasks, perhaps as simple as pulling out some images and describing them etc.This is a great way to generate web based reading tasks from authentic materials that students can access in an authentic way.

{"title": "Future of Educational Technology 1: The Digital Divide", "date": "Wednesday 14 April 2010", "text": "This will be the first in a series of articles I’m planning to post over the next few weeks on the topic of the future of learning technologies.In this series I’m going to look at some trends and developments in a range of technologies and try to see how they relate to each other and how they might impact on education over the the next few years.One of the first things I would like to focus on is the digital divide and what I believe is the ‘myth’ that technology is expensive.Firstly, I would like to state that the digital divide hasn’t been created by technology, but by economics. It’s a financial divide  that has been around  for thousands of years and one that thousands of years of paper education hasn’t been able to bridge.Here is some thing that I feel puts this in perspective though.PastI first bought a computer in 1997. It cost almost £2,500. It was one of the first computers with an MMX chip which meant that, as well as connecting to the Internet (by unplugging my phone and connecting the cable to my computer)  at a staggering 32k, if I waited long enough I could actually download and play extremely tiny and blurry video clips. When I paid extra (quite a lot extra) for some software I was able to create text and spread sheets and if I bought some more software I could edit images and make some pictures. This computer had the same storage capacity on the hard drive as that of all the computers in the UK in 1975 put together.PresentTen years later in 2007 I bought an iPod Touch. It had ten times the capacity of the computer I had paid £2,500 for so that’s ten times the capacity of all the computers in the UK in 1975 combined. It fits in my pocket, connects to the Internet through wireless broadband, I can stream and watch high quality video, audio, read and create text, download literally thousands of small applications to modify the tasks it can do for me from using it as a recording studio to drum machine to games console and it cost me well below 10% of what I paid for the computer ten years earlier.FutureIf this rate of development remains consistent that means that by 2017 for around £20 I will be able to by some form of portable device that will have 100 times the capacity of all the computers in the UK in 1975 put together, carry it in my pocket, if I need to carry it at all, be able to access the biggest library of books, audio and video ever assembled in the history of humankind and create who knows what on it.Photo credit: Scott Beale - Laughing SquidThe educational potential of such a device at that price is truly astounding, especially when you put that in perspective against the price of books. That’s approximately the same price as just one students’ text book at today’s prices.Often when I do talks or training on technology I get at least one teacher saying something about the digital divide, as if that were a good reason for not using technology in education (We’ll be making the digital divide bigger if we do!).This has the same logic as refusing to give your students food because some people in the world are starving! Surely what we really want is to feed everyone and to educate everyone and perhaps for the first time technology is taking us to a place where that might just be possible. Personally, I’m looking forward to 2017.In the next post in this series I'll be looking at the humble web cam and its possible role in the future of technology.Related linksLet us Now Praise Famous WomenTechnology newsThe Web 2.0 School of the PresentSocial Networks and the Web 2.0 Revolution: Part 2BestNik Peachey"},
{"title": "Let us Now Praise Famous Women", "date": "Monday 12 April 2010", "text": "This is a post that I have been trying to find time to write for over a year now and the urge and urgency to write it has grown every time I go to conference and every time I hear a few irritating comments.The comments usually fit into one or more of these categoriesWhere is all the new talent?Why aren’t there more women speakers around?Well technology that’s for the guys.I think that more than anything, after this years' IATEFL conference these kinds of comments should stop once and for all.So I’ve chosen focus this post on just a few of the many great tech savvy speakers, teachers, tweeters and of course women from this years conference.Shelly Turrell & Ozge KaraogluOne of the great presentations that everyone was talking about this year was by Shelly and Ozge.Ozge based in Turkey and Shelly based in Germany were reporting on a project they created between their classes of young learners. They shared the results of their work and information about the kinds of tools and the issues involved in running a project of this kind with young students.You can find out more about that project here: Engaging Lower Primary Students Through Web2.0 ToolsYou can also watch Shelly being interviewed about the project at: Interview with Shelly TurrellShelly publishes her own blog ‘Teacher Reboot Camp’ which focuses not on technology, but on the pedagogical exploitation of technology with students. So be sure to check that out.She is also one of the most prolific EFL tweeters with a huge following on Twitter, so if you are thinking of growing your PLN then her twitter page would be a great place to start.http://twitter.com/shellterrellShe also has her own video channel on YouTube where you can find loads of interesting clips to view:http://www.youtube.com/user/shellterrellOzge also has her own blog 'Ozge Karaoglu’s Blog' where she writes about and reviews Web 2.0 type tools for learning with a particular focus on using these tools with young learners.You can also add Ozge to your PLN and start following her on Twitter:http://twitter.com/ozgeMarisa ConstantinidesMarisa was just one of the stars of this years’ Pecha Kucha presentations (20 slides in 6.40 minutes). You can watch the Pecha Kuchas here: IATEFL 2010 Pecha KuchaMarisa also has her own blog ' TEFL Matters' where she publishes information on language teaching, teacher education and new technologies. Marisa is a teacher trainer and also runs a busy teacher training school in Athens. Among the things you can find on her blog are links to her recent presentation on animating course books with digital materials and some of her reflections on being an online teacher in a virtual world.You can also add Marisa to your PLN and start following her on Twitter at:http://twitter.com/Marisa_C Burcu AkyolBurcu was also one of the star presenters at this years’ Pecha Kucha event and she opened the event with 20 slides of 20 seconds about how Twitter had effected her professional life and its impact on conference events such as IATEFL and the recent  ISTEK International ELT Conference (27-28 March 2010 ) which she helped to organise in Turkey.Burcu also publishes her own blog 'Burcu Akyol's Blog' on a range of teaching and ELT related topics and I can highly recommend it particularly if you are looking for somewhere to find information about building your PLN.Yes you’ve already guessed that she too is prolific producer of tweets, so be sure to add her to your network.http://twitter.com/burcuakyolPetra Pointner Among Petra’s striking contributions to this years’ IATEFL conference was her presentation 'What students can get out of Twitter'  on her use of Twitter with her students. Petra talks  in this interview about how she became interested in Twitter and how it has impacted on her professional life. Interview with Petra PointnerYou can watch the whole of her presentation online at:http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zOCVqfg4FUYou can also add Petra to your PLN and follow her on Twitter at:http://twitter.com/TEFLPetKarenne Joy SylvesterLast but by no means least is Karenne Sylvester. Karenne’s presentation was on working in educational online communities and she explored some of the issues involved in being an e-moderator and working online with learners.You can also see Karenne doing, what for me was one of the highlights of the entire conference, her Pecha Kucha presentation on the history of the English language.Karenne also writes her own blog 'Kalingo English' which explores many of the pedagogical issues surrounding the use of educational technology with a particular focus towards business English. It’s a great read so do check that out.You can also follow her on Twitter at:http://twitter.com/kalinagoenglishSo here are just six of the many great women who were presenting at IATEFL this year. I have picked these six, not just because they are women, not because they blog or tweet and not because they use technology, but because all six are primarily great teachers and educators with great ideas that they want to share and because they critically apply their knowledge of education to the way they exploit technology with their students.For me this is of key importance and significance. Technology was a huge feature of this years’ IATEFL conference and it’s very easy to be blinded or pulled along by the technology, but in the work of these six women there is for me  some sign of the beginnings of a state of normalisation of technology in language teaching. A state when we can move past talking about technology and get back to talking about teaching of which technology is just a normal part and an enabler in that process of learning. I'm sure that time of normalisation will still be a long time coming, but it's great to see that at least it's beginning.Related links:IATEFL Online 2010Twitter vs Plurk Social Networks and the Web 2.0 Revolution: Part 2Create your own social network 7 stepsNaming My Sources: Part 1Naming My Sources: Part 2                    BestNik Peachey"},
{"title": "Quick Twitter Video Activity", "date": "Wednesday 13 January 2010", "text": "Educators seem to be constantly searching for new activities and ways to use Twitter with their Students. At the same time developers seem to be constantly looking for ways to build on the success of Twitter and develop apps and sites that will extend its functionality and increase its usefulness and usability.Chitter.TV is one of those sites. It allows you to visit various live TV channels from a range of sources, see what people are saying about them on Twitter and add your own comments.To add your comments you'll need to be logged in to your Twitter account, but once you are it's just a simple case of watching what is happening on the channels you are interested in and then writing your comment underneath and posting it directly to Twitter.Chitter.TV has quite a range of channels to choose from and they are not all English language ones. They vary from news channels to MTV and light entertainment channels all the way through to kids channels.Here's how you could use Chitter.TV with your studentsSend your students Chitter.TV get them registered and then ask them to go to the Sky News channel at: http://chitter.tv/index.php#skynewsThey will see a brief news summary of the main news stories of the moment. Ask them to watch the clip (it's about 2 - 3 mins long) and post headlines for each news story in the clip and  / or key facts to their Twitter stream.They'll be able to watch the news clip a few times as it loops, so this should give them some useful listening and summarising practice.You could even get them to write complete sentences from the news clip, like a dictation.You could get them to comment on or describe what they have watched.You could get them to tweet about which of the news headlines they felt was most important or which was most relevant to them.You'll then be able to check out what they have written in their Twitter stream and correct or comment.I think something like this would work well as a homework / self access task rather than a classroom task, but I guess you have to decide that for yourself.I hope you enjoy this and do post a comment if you think of other ways to use Chitter.TV with your students.Here you can find 25 more video related activities for EFL and ESL learners.Related links:20 WebCam Activities for EFL ESL StudentsSending Bubble Joy to your EFL / ESL StudentsMicroblogging for EFL with PlurkGreat Video Commenting ToolVideo conferencing for EFLSend Free Video MessagesAnimated Music Videos for EFL Creating multimedia stories12 Second Video Clips for EFL ESLTutorial: Using Videos from YouTubeGreat Video Commenting ToolBestNik Peachey"},
{"title": "4 Similar Tools to Wordle", "date": "Monday 7 December 2009", "text": "Wordle, a very simple tool for creating graphic word clouds of texts, has rocked the Edtech world and inspired a huge number of blog posts and teaching ideas, including my own back in September of 2008.  That's why I decided to use it as the basis for the first task in a web based 1 week open free workshop on Web 2.0 Tools for Teachers that I'm moderating for SEETA.As so many people are already familiar with Wordle, I thought I'd also share a few similar tools that can be used instead of or alongside Wordle with other web based resources to create useful learning materials for students. I've also added these here for anyone who doesn't make it along to the workshop.Wordnik (no connection to the Nik in my name) is a great tool for helping students find out more information about word and create lists or related words to help them remember the words. It provides lots of great examples of the words being used and draws on social media sites for the examples, so you can see how the word is used in Twitter, see what images are tagged with the word in Flickr and lots more.I wrote about Wordnik about a year ago when it was still Wordie, so look at this review if you want a bit more information. Creating word lists  I also created an activity for students to help them use the tool to work autonomously to develop their vocabulary. It needs a bit of updating now that the site has changed to Wordnik, but should give you some ideas  about how it can be used I hope. List Your Favourite WordsWordsift does a similar thing to Wordle, in that it produces a word cloud of words from a text, but it is far less visual and more functional. Once your students have produced the word cloud they can start actually clicking on the words and exploring their meanings and getting examples.I wrote a review of WordSift here which shows a bit more about how to use it.Analysing Vocabulary in TextsHere’s an example of how I’ve tried to integrate it with other web based tools and resources to create an activity for students to work on independently. Find Out More About TextsVocab Grabber is another tool that can be used to get more information about the words from a text. Vocab Grabber is more of a Dictionary / Thesaurus tool that pulls in information about words in a text, gives examples and also shows related words and word families.I wrote this activity which exploits some marketing videos that have scripts along with WordGrabber and another tool called Future Me. I tried to use the combination of these tools to show how students could build good habits to enable them to learn, remember and revise new vocabulary. Develop Your Marketing VocabularyEasy define is a new tool that I just spotted this morning. It is a bit like a dictionary - word list creation tool. You simply type in a list of words ( or even paste in a complete text) and it will generate dictionary entries for all the words. You can then download these as a doc file or copy and past them. It will also produce a list of synonyms.This is a great tool for creating paper based vocabulary worksheets. Once you’ve typed in your list or text and generated the definitions, you can simply download it and edit to create vocabulary records or matching activities. Should be a big time saver. You could get students to create word lists from their Wordle images.I hope these tools are useful and if you know of other similar tools that you think are useful, please do post a link to them below, especially if you can include links to any materials you've created with them that you would like to share.Related links: 50 + Vocabulary building activities for students20 + Tools and tips for developing vocabularyCloze Test Creation ToolAI and Chat Bots for EFL ESLPicture phrasesCreate Image BooksCreate a Flickr MontageBestNik Peachey"},
{"title": "The Web 2.0 School of the Present", "date": "Wednesday 25 November 2009", "text": "I was recently invited to participate in a really interesting workshop organised by Richard Johnson, Director of ELI Seville. The focus of the workshop was 'The Language School of the Future' and it produced a number of scenarios for the possible development of private language schools, which varied from the 'business as normal' model to a total shift away from scheduled classroom lessons. I'll post more about those scenarios later in the month, but it did occur to me that before we look to the future we could pull language schools and language departments into the present.The 'Web 2.0' age has brought us more than a bunch of social networking apps and free web tools, it has also brought about a fundamental shift in the way many web based companies do business. I started to wonder if that change could be mirrored in the physical market place by moving towards a new approach to the language school and the way technology is used in it and how it fits into the face to face business model.What follows are some suggestions for what I feel could bring about a shift in the way language schools market themselves and integrate technology, not just into the classroom, but to the whole school environment.How to make your school a Web 2.0 school of the present1. Ubiquitous open wireless accessThis is probably the most basic and fundamental change that you could introduce in your school and the one thing that could have the biggest long term impact.Make wireless Internet access freely available from anywhere in the school, without restriction, to anyone who wants to walk through your door, regardless of whether they pay for a course and regardless of how they use the access (within the bounds of the law and socially acceptable norms etc). Don’t password protect the access make it easily available to anyone and everyone.In doing this you have removed one of the most significant obstacles to the exploitation of web enabled technology within your school. Teachers will have FAR fewer problems using Internet in classroom and will feel more confident about trying things out new things and experimenting in a more spontaneous manner.They will have far fewer problems accessing online professional development materials and web based teaching materials and they will be in a much better position to start developing themselves and joining the numerous online communities of teachers globally that support and develop each other.You will soon find more students and teachers coming to your school with laptops and other mobile devices to use the free Internet access and staying longer. You will have succeeded in making your school 'sticky'.2. Make your whole school into a learning zoneOnce you have open access wireless connectivity in your school, the whole school can become a learning zone, not just the classroom. Help students to exploit this.Make room for people to come and hang out in your school, a kind of relax cafe area where they can bring in a laptop or other portable device. Make it friendly and sociable (don’t provide computers for them or computer booths where they sit facing the wall, make it open where people can wander around and see what others are doing etc.Have member(s) of your teaching staff on hand in this area to provide free assistance to anyone who wants to come in and learn. It could be anything from a bit of help with their pronunciation or advice in pointing them towards the best online materials available to help them learn autonomously, or giving advice to parents on how to help their kids learn online.Make sure you have plenty of visible information about good learning tools and freely available resources and where online learners and teachers can find and try them all over your school. All of this might seem like you are giving away your 'product' but if your teachers are good  and people are learning informally in your school, they may soon find that they want to learn more and take more formalised classes.3. Get teachers developing online materials and sharing in the benefitsLots of schools try to get teachers creating and sharing materials but there is seldom any reward or acknowledgement of the amount of time and care this takes. Get your teachers together and start training them to use blogs and wikis and get them producing and publishing their teaching materials online. Try to get them to pool these materials into one easily searchable wiki type site or a group of interconnected blog sites.Make sure that they know that they will retain copyright and ownership of all the materials they produce and that they will continue to own these materials even if they leave your school. The materials will become part of their professional portfolio.Make the materials your teachers produce freely available and open to the whole world to use, comment on and feedback on. This will help to make your teachers more aware of the quality of the materials they are publishing and get feedback to create and improve their materials. They will also find out how their materials are being used.Plug in revenue generating tools such as GoogleAdsense etc, look for sponsorship and advertising and make it clear that all teachers who contribute will get their share of any revenue that is generated. Make it clear that the school will not take a percentage of any of the revenue generated, but will only benefit through the links, branding and reputation it develops through displaying the quality of its teachers / materials and teaching.In the early days any revenue generated through advertising will be small, but as the scale of the resources grow, so will the revenue.4. Getting technology into your classroomsA lot has been said about the pros and cons of interactive whiteboards (IWBs), but whether you like them or hate them, they are part of the natural evolution that is taking place within the classroom and most schools will soon have them. One criticism of IWBs is the price, but they don't have to cost a lot as there are low cost hardware systems available and free software which is every bit as good and in some cases better than the software that would come with a commercially purchased board.So here is what you can do to get your school equipped with low cost IWBs. Find your techiest geekiest teacher (the one who talks about things like Ubuntu and Linux) give him or her a budget and some free time and ask that he or she provides you with a home made interactive whiteboard installed and ready to demo. Tell him or her that if it works they can have an extra time to produce more.If your teacher is successful you will then be able to put interactive white boards in every classroom for less that 100 euros a room (you will still need to have a computer and data projector for each classroom too, but this will have saved you significant amount of money)The best place to start researching about how to create a low cost IWB is Johnny Lee's website. Also get your nominated teacher to have a look at the Wiimote Project site.Here are 3 sites which produce free or low cost web based apps that can be used to replace the commercially produced IWB software.DabbleboardScriblinkTwiddlaHaving IWBs in class isn't a magic bullet, but it does at least get live Internet into your classes and increase the chances that your teachers will start using a more diverse range of multimedia materials than they would normally find in a course book.5. Get your teachers connected from anywhereOne of the best ways to get your teachers trained and web savvy is to make sure they have web access wherever they are. Subsidize your teachers' purchase of an i-Pod touch (even better an i-Phone if possible) and train them how to use it to download materials from i-Tunes, get free apps, view YouTube video, download free audio and video podcasts etc etc etc etc etc.Train them to use it in class (well before they actually need to) to show images, video get information etc. Within the next year the i-Pod touch is likely to include a camera for video too and this will enable teachers to start producing video projects with their classes too.6. Provide multimedia capable computersIt's amazing how many schools I visit that provide computers that don't have speakers. microphone or webcams! These are fundamental necessities for exploiting the true range of web based resources available and for transforming computers from passive information display devices into dynamic creative communication tools.Make sure every computer that you provide for the classroom, media lab or staffroom has a built in webcam and microphone as well as speakers or that these things are available.WebCams can enable teachers to bring the world into their classroom and take their classroom to the world in a very powerful way and for free.Make sure these computers are fitted with video, image and audio editing software. All of this can be accessed or downloaded free from the Internet. This can make a whole range of video and audio based activities possible.Of course the success of all of these measures is really dependent on training and motivating your staff, but by providing easily accessible wireless connectivity you are greatly increasing opportunities for staff to start developing themselves and each other and promoting in atmosphere in which learning can take place at anytime and anywhere in your school, not just in the classroom.I hope you find these ideas interesting, useful and at least a little bit provocative. By all means leave comments criticisms or suggestions.Related links: 10 Teacher Development Task for Web 2.0 Tools100 + Online activities for EFL ESL learnersSocial Networks and the Web 2.0 Revolution: Part 2Create your own social network 7 stepsWeb 2.0 Tools for EFL and ESL TeachersIWBs - Why having one is better than not having oneSome thoughts on interactive whiteboardsChoosing the right IWBBestNik Peachey"},

{"title": "My New Favourite YouTube Tool", "date": "Tuesday 27 October 2009", "text": "This is something that I spotted on Twitter a couple of days ago and have been playing with ever since. It's not actually a piece of software an app or even a site, it's a simple piece of code that you can use to change the URL of a YouTube video that transforms your page into a visual search tool that maps topics and relationships between videos.So what it does, is it changes this dull YouTube page:into this. A visual map of relayed videos. Each time you hover the mouse over one of the circles another set of related videos pop out and the you just click on a circle to play the video.To appreciate the difference you really have to experience it, so here's the link to the original YouTube page with a video about MarrakeshAnd now here's the 'warp'ed link with all the related videos which will start to show as you hover your mouse over them.So how is it done?Very simple, just replace the 'watch' in the URL to warp.swfExample:My Marrakesh video was at: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-FUM74WsQoSo I change that to http://www.youtube.com/warp.swf?v=e-FUM74WsQoThis should work with any YouTube video.So what's so great about this?Well taking my original video on Marrakesh, it now enables my students to search for related video information around the same topic very quickly and simply.As you move from video to video you create a kind of breadcrumb trail of dots which you can then click on to navigate back through the video you have watched.You can also click on the videos to play them full screen in your browser (nice feature IWB users)This is a great way to get students researching information around a topic you want to discuss in class or just creating and exploring conceptual associations. You could do this in class if you have data projector and try to get students to explain the connections, like six degrees of seperations. For example, how did I start with avideo of Marrakesh and end up with one of Shakira dancing?I really enjoy this tool. It's also really handy for finding new music that's connected to the music you already like. Just 'warp' a music video from YouTube that you like and start exploring the connections.This tool will though access all and any YouTube videos, so keep that in mind when you consider using it with your students, especially younger ones.Hope you enjoy this.Related links:Creating multimedia stories12 Second Video Clips for EFL ESLTutorial: Using Videos from YouTubeSending Bubble Joy to your EFL / ESL StudentsGreat Video Commenting ToolA Picture's worthPicture phrasesPersonalised flashcardsExploiting Image SequencesBestNik Peachey"},
{"title": "Finding a Language Exchange Partner", "date": "Friday 23 October 2009", "text": "I've just spotted another language exchange website to add to a rapidly growing list of these sites. Scrabbin is distinctive however, because it is one of the simplest I've seen and because it also offers people the chance to arrange face 2 face events and meetings.It's very simple and free, you just create a profile, log in and then search for a suitable partner to exchange languages with.When you create your profile you specify the kind of exchange you want to have, i.e. voice, email and / or face to face.You then browse the profiles of the people who speak the language you want to learn and leave them a message to see if they want to partner you.All very simple stuff. Does it work in terms of language learning? Well I guess that depeds on you and the partner you find, but at least it's a simple free way to find someone to practice using the language you want to learn with.There doesn't seem to be any age restriction on the site and they do seem to take privacy quite seriously, but if you recommend this to your students I would still be very careful to make sure they know not to share personal information  regarding their address etc and would caution against any one to one face to face meetings.Hope you find Scrabbin useful.Related links:Learn a Song in EnglishTry a TOEFL Reading TestImprove Your Vocabulary and Make FriendsExercise Your Ears With Authentic Film ClipsRecord Yourself Reading a PoemUsing a Word Cloud to Remember Words and TextsTake a Quiz Adventure JourneyCreate an Online CV in EnglishBestNik Peachey"},
{"title": "Create Quick Online Polls", "date": "Wednesday 21 October 2009", "text": "Vorbeo must be one of the quickest and easiest poll creators I've ever seen.

{"title": "Using Movie Soundtracks in the EFL ESL Classroom", "date": "Friday 9 October 2009", "text": "Using films and movies in class is a great way to encourage students to learn more language, so if you use them a lot then this site will be handy for you.It's called MoMupl and it searches a database of movie sound tracks to help you find all the songs and music from films. You just type in the title of the movie and then click on the results to get a full list of the music tracks from that movieYou can then just play any of the tracks you want to hear in the browser.This is a great tool that you can combine with the work you do on movies. Music is a very strong aid to memory, so you can use the music to prompt students to remember or it can just enhance the atmosphere of your lesson.You can use this with students in a number of ways.Find the sound track for a movie your students have been studying and play different tracks, then ask if they can remember what was happening in the part of the movie when this music was playing. Use sounds tracks before the students watch the movie. Play them various clips and see what they can predict about the movie from the music. Get the students to create their own movie scenario from the different tracks.Get students to find a sound clip from their favourite movie and tell others about it in class.Use sound tracks from movies as the back ground for story telling.Give students some exerts from movie scripts (download scripts from Drew's Script-O-Rama). Get them to read 4 or 5 short dialogues then play them a short exert from a sound track and see if they can match the sound track to the movie script.I like MoMupl because it combines couple of my passions (music and film) and even if you don't use it with your students, it's still useful for finding out who it was that wrote the music you liked in the film that you watched.I hope you find it useful.Here you can find activities for EFL ESL students that use music.Related links: Animated Music Videos for EFL Get the Stars to Sing Your Students' WordsWrite a Music Video ReviewSpot Talent for your Record LabelCan Music Aid Memory of Text?Karaoke with a Social NetworkAnother Great New Karaoke SiteGreat New Karaoke SiteBestNik Peachey"},
{"title": "Crazy Comparatives & Superlatives", "date": "Thursday 8 October 2009", "text": "I have to say that I used to dread teaching comparatives and superlatives and always found it really hard to think of something original to get my students interested, so when I saw this site I was really delighted. It's not only quite funny, but has some excellent materials for covering what can be a really dull language point.The site is called the Universal Record Database and it is a collection of user generated and very unofficial world records. Anyone can go on the site and create their own world record. As proof they simply add an image or a video of themselves creating the record.Here's a few examples:Most People Simultaneously Drinking Out Of A PineappleThe widest tongueMost Handshakes Elicted From A Dog In 30 SecondsMost Women Named Wendy To Eat At A Wendy'sThere are lots of ways to use the Universal Record Database  with students.Show them some images and videos and see if they can guess what the record was.Tell them the type of record and see if the can guess the number or amount (e.g. how wide is the widest tongue)Get students to think of their own crazy records and create a picture or video to upload to the site.Create your own class records and try to get each students to have a record.Get students to try to break one of the records from the site.Get students to find their favourite record on the site or the one they think is funniest and share it with the class, or blog about it.The Universal Record Database  certainly wasn't made for educational purposes, so be careful to check for appropriacy according to your students, but I think it's a wonderful example of the kind of bizare things you can use from the web. I know my daughter was always fascinated by the Guinness Book of World Records, so I'm pretty sure students will enjoy this and it will liven up those dull comparatives and superlatives class.Anyway, here's my favourite record, Tallest Tower Of Humans Wearing One Sock Each, Brushing Teeth And Listening To 'Thriller'.I hope you find this useful and have a lot of fun with your students.Here you can find more than 100 online activities for EFL and ESL studentsRelated links:12 Second Video Clips for EFL ESLCreate Image Books20 WebCam Activities for EFL ESL StudentsSending Bubble Joy to your EFL / ESL StudentsMicroblogging for EFL with PlurkGreat Video Commenting ToolVideo conferencing for EFLSend Free Video MessagesBestNik Peachey"},
{"title": "Find Easy to Read Text for Lower Levels", "date": "Tuesday 6 October 2009", "text": "I sometimes wonder why companies continue developing search engines when Google's dominance seems so complete, but every now and then I spot one that has a nice twist and that's the case with Twurdy.Twurdy is actually based on Google, but it analyses Google results for readability, so it can help you to find more lower level texts for learners without you having to read through every result from Google to see if it's simple enough.Just type in the topic of the text you need and click on your Twurdy type. You have a choice of three different Twurdy types. The differences are mainly speed (how fast you want your results) vs complexity (how thoroughly you want the results analysed) I would recommend choosing Twurdy with Pop as this will analyse the number of word on the page, length of sentences, number of syllables per word and also the popularity of the words in the text.Getting more accurate results will save you time in the long run and even using Twurdy Pop isn't so slow.The results will then be shown colour / shade coded and with a rating.

{"title": "Comparing Texts to Aid Noticing", "date": "Tuesday 29 September 2009", "text": "QuickDiff is an interesting tool that analyses differences in two very similar texts. It was actually developed for examining programming code, but could be a really useful tool to use with students to get them to look more closely at the texts they write and notice the mistakes and corrections and differences in the text.You simply copy and paste your text into the two fields. Then make any changes in the left hand field.Then you click on the compare button and the differences will be highlighted below.You could use this as a simple marking tool to show students where their errors are, just by printing up the results, or you could try to get students spotting their own errors. When your students submit their texts to you for correction you can make another copy of their work without any errors and then ask them to compare and find where you have made changes. Ask them to highlight any differences they find between the texts. Then ask them to paste their original text and your corrected text into the text fields in QuickDiff and see if they found all the differences.You could also cut and paste a text from a news site or wikipedia and add some errors for students to find, then give them the source of the article and they can cut and paste into QuickDiff to see if they have found them all.Remember though that the corrected text has to go in the left-hand field and the original in the right and you need to select 'Inline' before you click 'Compare'.This is an interesting tool to get students looking more closely at their work and finding their own errors rather than just looking at their marks and moving on, and will help train them to 'notice' more about written text.I hope you find it useful.Here you can find more writing activities for EFL and ESL studentsRelated links:Translate Shakespeare 2 Text Lingo 4 Twitter??Revising Short Texts and Syntax on IWBWrite Your Own Quick BiographyAnimated EFL ESL Writing PromptsText to Speech for EFL ESL MaterialsCreating audio-visual monologuesDrama project toolsMake you own animated moviesDeveloping screencast tutorialsExtending a Sentence60 Second Writing ActivityBestNik Peachey"},

There are five videos in each collection and they all use songs with quite clear simple lyrics. The animation is marvelous and clever, though very simple and clearly illustrates the meaning of the songs while showing the lyrics.It really wouldn't take much work to turn each of these into a short language lesson, or you could use one as an example for your students and get them to draw simple illustrations for a song and create their own video.These are fantastic authentic materials.

{"title": "A Speed Reader with a Library", "date": "Friday 25 September 2009", "text": "I'm never really sure what the value of being able to read quickly is and whether this effects the amount of information you actually retain when you read, but I do know that getting EFL and ESL students to read in chunks and getting them to read as much as possible can be very beneficial to their language development.I've come across quite a few online speed reading sites, but so far I think ReadSpeeder is the best. The interface is quite simply designed and easy to use. It looks just like the kind of controls you would find on a cassette or CD player. ReadSpeeder chunks the text and you can change the speed at which you see the chunks of the text or pause it and just click to got to the next phrase as you read.The things that make ReadSpeeder special though are:It has its own built in library, so there are loads of classic books that students can get started with straight away.There is also a neat bookmarklet. You drag it to your toolbar, then whenever you get to a web page you want to speed read, you can just click on it and it will be played through ReadSpeeder.If you register you can start adding  and saving your own texts simply by cutting and pasting.Perhaps best of all though is that you can access a dedicated mobile site (http://m.readspeeder.com) on i-phone or i-Pod Touch and access your saved books. This is a great feature as students can work alone at home or anywhere else on improving their reading. It's also quite a good way to read on an i-phone as it makes the text bigger.As I said, I'm not sure if being able to read faster is such a great skill, but this is still a good way to get your students working through texts and trying to understand 'gist' without them stopping to check every word and also a good way to get them seeing text in chunks.You could use it as I said above to get students to read for gist and just see how much of the text they understand after reading through one time.You could use it as a way to get students to revise a text.You could even get students to recite the text as they speed read it and gradually try to improve the speed. You might well have to start very slowly.Some students can find this kind of time challenge motivating and it can encourage them to repeatedly read the same text to improve their speed.Well, I hope your students enjoy trying ReadSpeeder. It may not be the best tool for every text they read, but it's a good way to add a bit of variety to your reading activities and to give students access to a tool they can use outside of class (if they have an i-Pod or i-Phone).You can find 35 + online reading activities for EFL ESL students here.Related links:Write Your Own Quick BiographyAnimated EFL ESL Writing PromptsText to Speech for EFL ESL MaterialsCreating audio-visual monologuesDrama project toolsMake you own animated moviesDeveloping screencast tutorialsExtending a Sentence60 Second Writing ActivityBestNik Peachey"},

You can either search by city or country, enter keywords and search or browse destination or the collection of videos related to specific events.The content is really simple to access and is well organised and the video clips are small and short - not really appropriate for a single computer classroom, but great for students doing research or activities work in alone or in pairs on their computer.There are a number of tasks you could set students using this material.Get each student to think of a country or city they would like to visit,  send them away to research an event that is happening in that city / country then they can come back to class tell other students about the event and try to persuade them to come to the event with them.You could get students to browse through the video section watch some of the videos and decide which place they would most like to go to.You could get students to research their own country, find out what events are being advertised and see if the information is accurate. They could then create their own content based around any events that happen in their country that have been missed, using the website entries as a model.I really like the site because the information comes in different media and is very much split into the kinds of small digestible chunks that lend themselves to online study and language development.This isn't a site that was designed for education so their is quite a bit of advertising, but your students will need to get used to noticing and ignoring that.I hope you find it useful and your students enjoy it.Related links:Creating multimedia storiesNews Videos for EFL ESL Materials DesignThings You Can Do With Your WebCam 1Exploiting a Video ViralLesson plan Top 10 Cartoons for Children’s RightsCreate a YouTube CarouselVideos for Global Issues LessonsUpdate on the Education Clip LibraryBestNik Peachey"},

You simply type in the name of the person who's biography you want to create and then click a link to generate questions about that person ( or yourself).Completing the answers to the questions enables the site to generate the text for the biography. It really couldn't be any easier. If you don't like a question you just skip it.I actually found it a lot of fun and some of the questions are really quite interesting and searching. This is a great tool for students to try out.Students could write and share their own biography.Write the fictional biography of a character from a book they are reading.Create their own fictional characters' biographies as the basis for brainstorming their own creative writing project.Write the factual biography of someone they are researchingWrite a biography of one of their family members using the questions for the basis of an interview they do for homework.Once biography has been created you can also discuss it with students by clicking the discussion link.This is a really simple but very usable site. It does worry me though that it seems like anyone can go and edit the biography of anyone else, but I guess if you treat the thing like harmless fun then it isn't so serious.I hope you enjoy this site and make sure you don't edit my biography!

{"title": "How to Create Bomomo Art", "date": "Friday 31 July 2009", "text": "Bomomo is a fantastic online tool for creating colourful abstract images in just a few seconds.Bomomo looks like an online Paint program, and it is very similar, but it has a very interesting collection of tools for drawing, which make it hard to control but also very creative.You simply select your tool and then click on the canvas. Try moving the mouse around before and after you click and then try clicking and holding down the mouse keeping it in a single position and then dragging it. This will create different effects with each of the different tools.I felt I got my best results by creating a colourful background first using this tool (see below) if you click on the screen and hold down then drag you will get wide bands of vertical colour. If you then repeat that you'll get wide bands of horizontal colour. This makes a good background for some of the other tools and the patterns they can create.This one creates nice circles if you click and hold  the mouse at a static point.Another of my favourites is this one which creates vertical and horizontal shapes where ever you click. Try holding the mouse down and dragging it too.You can also get some interesting bubble effects with this tool.The best thing to do is experiment withe the various tools and see what they do and which effects work best together.If you don't like what you get just click and get a new canvas. If do like what you've got then just click and save your work as jpg file or a png.It's really that easy. Once you have created your images you can either use them as backgrounds for banners or just to liven up dull pages.So how can we use this tool in the EFL classroom?Well you could create some images for your students and see if they can associate them with words or feelings.They could discuss which ones they like.They could create there own to express different feelings or link them to abstract concepts like fear, love, independence etc and so create a graphic vocabulary.They could try to write a short poem or haiku and link it to an image.You could also just use it to decorate the classroom or a class website or blog.I hope you enjoy playing with this tool.Here you can find more image based activities for EFL ESL studentsRelated links:Create Image BooksCreate a Flickr MontageGreat Time Line ToolCreate a YouTube CarouselInteractive presentationsA Picture's worthPicture phrasesMake Your EFL ESL YearbookPersonalised flashcardsBestNik Peachey"},

Then they should write a story of the context surrounding the clip, i.e.What's happening?Who are the people?Why are they there?What happened before the clip?What happens next?etcThis is a good way to get students using contrasting time structures and tenses in a reasonably creative and imaginative way.

Test - In test mode the students get a simple audio test. They can hear either the word in isolation or in a sentence and they have to type it into the field. This is a great test to use with words that sound similar as it can give students the opportunity to test their ability to hear the difference both in isolation or in the context of a sentence.2. Teach - In the teach mode the students hear the word alone and in a sentence and then the word is spelled out for them.3. Play - In the game mode the students have the choice of a range of games that they can use to develop their ability to use the word in context or just test the recall of the words and ability to recognise them.Matching activityHang MouseHow about using this with students?You can either get students working alone on Spelling City revising their vocabulary or if you have an interactive whileboard or data projector in class you can create the tests in class in response to the new vocabulary demands of your students during class. just collect any new words that come up during the class and towards the end of class or at the beginning of the next get the words up on the board and click to create some interactive tests  live in class. Just add your words then click to test, teach or play a game. If you use a game you can click the small icon in the top right corner to see the game full screen on the board.Many of the games will also provide a print friendly version of the activity for you to print and use in class, so you caould also use this tool to creat a range of paper based word game activities too. Spelling City is a great tool that can really help EFL ESL students with their spelling, vocabulary, listening and receptive pronunciation. Would be marvelous if you could download and save the activities that are generated, but I guess you can't have everything.I'm also not sure how big the database of words and audio sentences is, so I'm not sure what kind of coverage this would have for higher levels, but for lower level learners and for kids, I'm sure it's a winner.

{"title": "What are you Wanted for?", "date": "Tuesday 14 July 2009", "text": "I just came across this collection of fun photo adapting tools and thought this one that enables you to create a 'Wanted' poster from your own image could be a useful one to use with students or on teacher training courses.It's really easy to use, you just upload an image and then write in your own caption. You can then download and print the images or add them to blogs or web pages.There are a number of ways you could use this with your students:As a writing prompt - Get them to create their own 'Wanted' poster with their own captions and then exchange the posters and get someone else in the class to write the story of how they became 'Wanted'.As a speaking prompt - Get students to create and print their wanted poster and then create their own fictional story of how they became 'Wanted'. See which students can create the best story.For self-evaluation and reflection - Get students to think about their weaknesses and select one weakness they would like to work on improving . They should add this as the caption, then get them to think of how improving that weakness will help them and add this as the reward (they will need to be concise). They can then print their 'Wanted' posters and hang them up in class around the walls as reminders of what they need to focus on. The students could then look at each other's posters and offer each other tips and advice on how they can improve. This can work well with teacher training sessions too.I hope you make some useful wanted posters and be sure to check out some of the other ways in which you can adapt your images here. Do leave a comment if you came up with some good ideas for how to use them and let me know which ones are your favourites.Related links:Animated EFL ESL Writing PromptsPrompting reading speeds Animating vocabulary Interactive multiple choice activities Picture phrases Make you own animated moviesExtending a Sentence60 Second Writing ActivityCreate an English CartoonBestNik Peachey"},
{"title": "Multilingual Instant Chat Rooms", "date": "Tuesday 23 June 2009", "text": "This is an interesting new approach to instant chat rooms that I haven't seen before.  BabelWith.Me actually translates the chat text for you as you chat with people who use other languages.It's really easy to set up, you just go to the BabelWith.Me home page and click on 'Start a Conversation'. This creates a chat room for you and you then just choose your user name.  You can then select the language you want to use and send the unique link to the room to the people who you want to chat with.Here's the link to the room I created, but I'm not sure how long this will stay live: http://www.babelwith.me/CxErI'm not sure how well the translation works, but there are quite a few languages to choose from, so why not give it a try. You can also send invitations out through the interface using Twitter, Facebook or email, which could be handy.This could be a nice tool to use if you are running a cultural exchange with students from another country.You could get half your class communicating in English and half using their L1 and see how well they understand each other (It could illustrate for them the limitations of translation).It could just be a nice way to get students chatting with other classes or interviewing people from outside your class (with or without the translation feature).I hope you find it useful. Here you can find chat activities for students.Related links:AI and Chat Bots for EFL ESLSending Bubble Joy to your EFL / ESL StudentsVideo conferencing for EFLA Virtual World for Facebook UsersMake your own chat roomOnline Video: As CommunicationSending Bubble Joy to your EFL / ESL StudentsMicroblogging for EFL with PlurkGreat Video Commenting ToolBestNik Peachey"},
{"title": "Multiple Media Search", "date": "Monday 22 June 2009", "text": "I have to say that I think Spezify has just become my favourite new search engine. I think this is a really great search engine to use in class with students or to get them to use. It's really simple. It displays all results as images and it searches a wide range of multiple media sources such as video, image Twitter etc, not only text.To make a search you just type in your key word and all the results start to appear as images.If you click on the small spanner icon at the top right you can adjust the setting.There is a safe search option here which is on by default, so that's handy. You can also turn various other options on or off so that you restrict which sources are included in your results.As I said I think this is a nice search engine to use in class on IWB / data projector or for students.You could type in keywords to brainstorm around topics or themes for the class you are doing.You could type in a keyword and get students to choose one result that they think will be interesting and get them to explore it as a warmer.You could get students to find an image, a text, a video and a tweet and write / talk about the connection between them.Or you could just use it to reinforce and find examples of vocabulary.Hope you like  Spezify and find some good uses for it in your class.Related links:Creating Word ListsFlickr and Wiktionary Based Image DictionaryImage based activitiesExploiting Travel ImagesArt Photography as a Basis for Language ActivitiesDarwin and EvolutionCreate Image BooksCreate a Flickr MontageBestNik Peachey"},
{"title": "A Database of Film Scripts", "date": "Saturday 20 June 2009", "text": "Something that's always handy to have as either reading materials, support for video lessons or for drama projects, is access to up to date film scripts, so The Internet Movie Script Database is a great one to keep in your bookmarks.It has quite a few up-to-date movies that are reasonably easy to access.  You can search for a particular name or browse by genre or by alphabetical listing.There's a landing page with a few ads on before you get to the actual script link, but one you get to the script it's reasonably easy to print or copy for you students.As I said, there are lots of ways you can use these scripts:Get students to learn and act them outget students to read parts of the script and try to imaging the way the actor would say the lines (what kinds of emotions they would express through the words etc) then watch the films and compare.Get students to watch the film and follow + analyse languageGet students to listen and mark on any features of pronunciation Get students to listen the film and try to imitate pronunciation and record themselvesUse small parts as reading activities You could cut and paste the script into something like CuePrompter and get them to read lines from it that way.Scripts like this add a new dimension to reading activities because they use spoken language and screen / stage direction that push students to imagine and visualise how things would happen and be communicated visually on film.I hope you and your students enjoy them.

{"title": "Create Your Lego Avatar", "date": "Tuesday 16 June 2009", "text": "Having an avatar (some kind of representation of yourself) can be pretty handy both for you and your students. It's a good way to protect your students' identity if they are becoming part of an online community and helps reduce the amount of unwanted attention that some very attractive students might get from having their real image on a site.Mini-Mizer 3.0 is a really nice way to get your students creating avatars. It's really easy to use and they can quickly click through the various options for customising the basic blank figure.They can add various extras and backgrounds as well as changing all the features of the face. They could try to make the avatar look like themselves or totally different. When they are finished they will just need to take a screen grab of the image and then they can use is it when ever they create online profiles on any social type sites.You can also use Mini-Mizer 3.0 in classes to develop language of description.You could write some brief descriptions of people and get students to try create an avatar of them.You could describe a famous person, get the students to create an avatar and then guess who the famous person is. The students could decide which avatar looks most like the celebrity.Students could work in pairs, one with an image that they describe but don't show while the other listens / asks questions and tries to recreate an avatar version of the image.Students could create avatars of someone in the class and the others could try to guess who it is.Mini-Mizer 3.0 is a simple free fun tool, that particularly younger students are likely to enjoy using and which can be used to help protect your students' identity.

{"title": "Tap into the Backchannel in Your Presentation", "date": "Thursday 11 June 2009", "text": "Recently, I've been doing quite a few interviews within Second Life as part of the Coffee With series, and one of the things that I've found most fascinating (apart from the insights of my guests of course) is the amount of text activity going on in the 'backchannel' while the interview is going on.Each time I ask the guest a questions, I see a stream of text chat appearing as almost everyone in the room adds their own comments and answers to the question  I addressed to the guest. When this first started happening I found it incredibly distracting and a bit rude, but pretty soon realised that it was one of the most interesting aspects of this kind of event in Second Life and that there was some really valuable information being circulated behind and in response to what was happening in the interview and it wasn't being captured.This is rather a long introduction into why I find Today's Meet so interesting. Today's Meet is a very simple way to set up an instant text chat room. That isn't particularly anything new, but what is good is that they are promoting for use during classes, lectures, presentations etc, to capture the 'backchannel'.The idea is this:You set up your instant chat room (just type in a name to create the URL)Share the URL with the people in your class, lecture, presentation etc.They log in and can chat and communicate with each other, share ideas, references, ask for clarification during the session.You can either respond to the text during your session or review it at the end and clarify, confirm, refute, augment.This makes the process of teaching/learning much more communal, collaborative, inclusive and hopefully engaging.Of course this is a tool for those who are mobile connected, but still a good idea for those working in that context.You will also have to get used to people tapping away during your session, but especially for those working with really large groups where addressing everyone questions and comments can be difficult I think this means of providing a 'backchannel' to enable peer support can be really useful.I hope you find it useful too.Related links:Photo Assignments for EFL ESL Students in Second LifeEducational Games That Really Are FunOnline Water Conservation GameMake your own chat roomFilming in Second Life 1Teaching Speaking in Second LifeMore Second Life TutorialsBuilding in Second LifeLip Sync for Second LifeMaterials design for Virtual WorldsTeaching English in Second LifeBestNik Peachey"},
{"title": "When Twitter isn't Enough", "date": "Wednesday 10 June 2009", "text": "I know that everybody loves Twitter at the moment and microblogging and other 'micro genre' are  generally growing in popularity, but there are times when 140 characters or 12 Seconds aren't enough, and that can be pretty frustrating, so Write4net looks like a pretty handy tool for anyone who doesn't want to compromise on what they have to say, but still wants to deliver the message to their Twitter following.It looks quite simple to use and you don't need to register, though you do need to put in your Twitter information (or be logged in to your Twitter account) so that it can post to your Twitter feed.You just add a title, write your text and add some hash tags if you feel the need. Then start writing your text. You can format the text, add images, have external links and embedded video etc too if you want to go that far.Then when you are ready, just click to publish it and broadcast it to your following.Write4net creates a page for your posting and then your Twitter followers can click through to it. The page gives you some interesting stats too about how many people click through to the page and view your posting. Always handy to know this kind of thing.Here is the actual page if you would like to check it out. Shidonni IntroductionWrite4net sells itself as being an alternative to a blog, and in the end it looks a lot like a blog, but it is really quick and simple and allows you to get a good degree of media rich information out to your Twitter following, though do be sure to add a good instructive title so that people know whether they want to click through or not. This is how my test posting appeared.If you are hooked on Twitter and use it a lot with students or get your students to use it a lot, this could be a really useful way of giving a bit more depth and scope to your interactions. It is really quick and easy.You could start using it to deliver media rich assignments with images and video, without having to go to very much trouble. Your students could also leave comments on the text (the comments will also be tweeted) , so there are some nice simple features here.On the whole I think this is a pretty useful tool, but I don't think it will be replacing my blogs quite yet. I hope you enjoy it.Related links:Note Taking Tool for Digital Literacy12 Second Video Clips for EFL ESLMicroblogging for EFL with PlurkIdeas for Creative WritingSimple Tool for Collaborative WritingBestNik Peachey"},

Also great for doing Business English classes on market research and thinking of questions they could ask about products.You can see a list of 'hot' questions here.The other nice thing is that you get a choice of embed codes to either add the survey to a site page or sidebar as well as a hyperlink you can share./* <![CDATA[ */(function(){try{var c=function(){setTimeout(function(){var t=document.createElement(\"script\");t.src=\"http://widgets.ask500people.com/ask_widget/edge.js?k%3D6fbp0kfh%26s%3Dblue%26w%3D200%26q%3D43483\";t.src=unescape(t.src);t.type=\"text/javascript\";t.charset=\"utf-8\";document.body.appendChild(t);},1);};window.addEventListener(\"load\",c,false);} catch(e){try{window.attachEvent(\"onload\",c);} catch(e){}}})();/* ]]> */Here you can see the page widget with results and comments.I hope you and your students enjoy it.

You type words into a field, click a button and  then you can hear the words being sung. You can them email a link to the song to yourself or a friend and then paste the link into a workheet or blog page etc.The site generates the song through a huge dictionary of audio clips from famous songs, so the song is a collection of some of the worlds singers with each word by a different singer and from a different song. It's just such a wonderful idea and so quick to use.You can get your students writing songs, short messages etc.You can copy and paste in lyrics of songs (you can find lyrics here)and get your students to listen and try to guess what the original song was. Try this one.Not all of the words are included in the database, so the site will put in words that have some of the same letters. You can use this by printing up lyrics for your students and getting them to listen and circle where the mistakes are.You could even get them to listen and try to guess who sung the original words and what song they came from (probably easier for adult students as most of the songs are quite old)Thanks again to Larry for helping me to rediscover Let Them Sing It For You  one of my favourite tools.Related links:Write a Music Video ReviewSpot Talent for your Record LabelCan Music Aid Memory of Text?Karaoke with a Social NetworkAnother Great New Karaoke SiteGreat New Karaoke SiteBestNik Peachey"},

{"title": "Setting Learning Goals", "date": "Monday 27 April 2009", "text": "Ever done one of those exercises where you get your students to decide on their learning goals? Do you ever get round to coming back to them and really seeing if they have been achieved?Well here's a little tool that may well help. It's called FutureMe and it's like an email message that you can send to yourself in the future.You just fill in the form with your message and then set a date for when in the future you want it to be delivered.You can use this to get students to check back on their original learning goals.You can use it to get students sending themselves reminders about new vocabulary they have learned. They can simply send themselves a message for a week or two in the future with the new words in and see if they can still remember them and what they mean etc.You could also do this for test revision. So many students do their tests, look at the score and then forget what the answer was. They could send themselves the questions they got wrong or right and see if they can still answer them a week or two in the future.The same could be done with errors and correction. They could send their mistakes to their future self to correct in a week's time.They could even send themselves notes from lessons or texts or even their own compositions to review and correct.FutureMe is a simple tool and quick and easy to use and could well help your students to become more autonomous learners by getting them to revise and review their work on a regular basis.Hope you like it.Related links:A Tool for Comparing WordsFlickr and Wiktionary Based Image DictionaryCreating Word ListsList Your Favourite WordsLearn Some ClichesInteractive multiple choice activities Video Dictionary 2.0Using Word Clouds in EFL ESLPicture phrasesBestNik Peachey"},

If you want to see how it works just watch this 3 minute movie.Using Tag Galaxy to Search Flickr ImagesOr read on.Tag Galaxy looks ordinary enough until you enter and search your first key word. Then you are presented with a galaxy of planets all representing related keywords and your search word at the centre.You can click on these related term to build up or refine your search. When you are ready you click on the central planet and watch as the images relating to your tag start to appear around your central globe.You can then click and drag to rotate the globe and look at the images. When you find an image that interests you, click on it to enlarge it. Then click again to get more information about the image.Clicking on the small rectangular icon bottom right of your screen will also make the interface full screen, which would look great on an interactive whiteboard.This is a great way to access images and would be great to use with students for vocabulary building , brainstorming, or playing word association, by getting students to predict images they will see or words which related to key concepts they type in such as politics, religion, purple, sport etc etc.I hope you enjoy playing with this great tool.Related links:Flickr and Wiktionary Based Image DictionaryImage based activitiesExploiting Travel ImagesArt Photography as a Basis for Language ActivitiesCreate Image BooksCreate a Flickr MontageGreat Time Line ToolCreate a YouTube CarouselInteractive presentationsA Picture's worthPicture phrasesMake Your EFL ESL YearbookPersonalised flashcardsAnimating vocabularyExploiting Image SequencesBestNik Peachey"},
{"title": "Interactive Forms for Surveys or E-Learning", "date": "Wednesday 22 April 2009", "text": "I've just been having a quick look a JotForm and it looks like a very useful tool. JotForm is a simple online tool for creating online forms of various kinds.There are a number of pre-configured ones that you can create and customize, just using the wizard, or you can create a blank one and add what ever features you want from the Toolbox, just by dragging them onto the page.Once you have your features on the page, you just click on them and edit the properties. It really is very simple to do. You can use JotForm for a whole range of things and it has some very powerful features. As well as adding images, password fields and captcha from the 'Power Tools' section, you can also add payment features, to enable you to charge for services.The blank form creation is great for creating your own e-learning materials. You add images, text and by dragging in an html element from the Power Tools, you can even put in code so that you can embed videos from YouTube or other rich media.Then all you need to do is add a few questions, or a text box for students to write in and when they click on submit, their answers will be sent to your email address or stored online.Apart from creating e-learning activities, you could use the forms to get feedback on your teaching or to do a range of classroom research tasks. You could even get your students creating class surveys and compiling the results. You can also embed the forms into your own website or blog.JotForm has a free option which allows for up to 3 forms a month and 100 responses, which should be enough for the average teacher.Fantastic free tool. There are some tutorials on the site too if you want to dig more deeply into the potential of this tool. Here's movie one showing you how to get started.Hope you find it useful.Related links:Cloze Test Creation ToolGetting Video Tasks OnlinePhoto Assignments for EFL ESL Students in Second LifeListening Dictation Puzzles for EFL ESLCreating an interactive cloze textMS Word tutorial 1: Adding ‘comments’BestNik Peachey"},
{"title": "Flickr and Wiktionary Based Image Dictionary", "date": "Tuesday 21 April 2009", "text": "Shahi is a visual dictionary that combines Wiktionary content with Flickr images, and more! This is a really handy tool for students or in the classroom if you have a computer + projector set up.All you do is type in your vocabulary word and you get images ( from Flickr, Google or Yahoo) and a definitions with part of speech and some example sentences from Wikitionary.If you want to give your students a better view of the images that the Shahi finds in relation to the word, then just click on the image and it enlarges.Of course the most common problem with picture dictionaries is that the concepts of many words, especially at higher levels aren't 'visual' as such and are much more abstract concepts. I did a search on 'noise' and here's what I got.You can use this to your advantage though by getting students to think about the connections and associations between the words you search for and the images. You can turn this into a game and give points to the students with the best explanation for the connection between word and image. The explanation could be literal or more imaginative and narrative based.One other thing that I like about Shahi, is that the results from each word you type in are 'piled up onto top of each other, so if you use it as a reference throughout a lesson or activity, you still have a record there of all the words that came up.You could also use this feature in reverse, by creating an image word list before the activity so that students can prepare their vocabulary and refer to it during the activity.Shahi is a nice versatile free tool and one that your students could easily use on their own.

{"title": "My Talking Faces", "date": "Friday 17 April 2009", "text": "PhotoFace is a novel way to get your students talking, recording themselves and creating fun speaking images for class or homework assignments.It's very simple to use. You can either upload your own image or use an image provided by the site.You need to drag the position of the crosses so that they are over the features of the face.Once you have done this you can alter the emotion of your image and click on the face and drag parts of it if you want to distort it.Once the face image is ready you have a choice of ways to add audio. This can be done by adding a pre-recorded file, using text to speech or recording from your microphone or telephone.If you use your microphone make sure you allow the site access it, then just click on record. You can record, listen and re-record as many time as you choose until, you get it right. I was actually very impressed with the sound quality. Once you have finished recording you simply need to email the link to the image to yourself or get your students to email the links to you.Here's the one I created using my own voice: Introduction to PhotoFaceI also created a speaking sea shell using the text to speech: Sea Shell. So you don't have to stick with just images of people.This is a great way to get your students to submit short speaking assignments to you by email. You can ask them to talk on a specific topic or give their opinions on on discussion tasks or contentious issues. It's quick easy and free, just a shame there is no embed code to enable you to put the talking heads into web pages or blogs.I hope you enjoy playing with this and that your students get a lot of speaking practice with it.Related links:Recording Skype CallsCreating audio-visual monologuesPronunciation goes 2.0Soundscapes from SoundtransitVideo Dictionary 2.0Skype Part 1 Recording AudioSkype Part 2 Online Workspace12 Second Video Clips for EFL ESLTeaching Speaking in Second LifeVideo conferencing for EFLBestNik Peachey"},

{"title": "Video for Dealing with Sensitive Issues", "date": "Wednesday 15 April 2009", "text": "I've just been checking out TrueTube, which is an impressive UK based site aimed at teens + and which deals with a wide range of sensitive social issues.The site allows users to upload and edit their own videos which tell their own stories.The site describes itself like this;\"Anorexia, poverty, depression, sex and crime are but a few of the social issues you’ll find on TrueTube. There are hundreds of real stories, voices from the “man in the street” and “expert” interviews, all brought together to highlight different angles to the issues at hand. Many videos and animations are made by us; others come to us from all over the world. TrueTube doesn’t judge, we don’t take sides and we certainly don’t think we have THE answers. We just want to give you food for thought.\"There's a really impressive collection of videos and advice on how to use them. I really enjoyed this one Young British Muslims and Ramadan's joys and struggles.    The website also has an 'Action' section with Masterclass, which has videos showing how to create and edit your own videos for the site. Choose your cause, which has people talking about different causes and Start a revolution, which has people talking about how they got involved in campaigns.The content is all authentic and has some great examples of various regional UK accents. Dealing with these kinds of topics in class can be very difficult, but having this kind of content as a way in can be very useful. Just getting students to look at the Choose your cause section and asking them which of the causes they most sympathise with could be a useful way to get started.To upload or comment on video you have to be a registered user, but registration is reasonably painless and once you register you are also able to download video from the site to use in class with out an Internet connection etc.I hope you find this content useful.Related links:Videos for Global Issues LessonsUNICEF: Top 10 Cartoons for Children’s RightsEducation for the Global EconomyTackling political issuesVideo debating websiteExpress Your OpinionsBestNik Peachey"},

{"title": "Language Learning Blog Carnival Spring 2009", "date": "Friday 10 April 2009", "text": "Well, finally, I have managed to work my way through the many excellent entries for the Spring 2009 Language Learning Blog Carnival. I have to say that it hasn't been easy, but it has been a very interesting process and one that has helped me to better define my own beliefs and opinions about what a 'good ' blog posting should be.Of course these beliefs and opinions are personal to me so you may not agree or share them, but they are what I have used to guide me in the choices I've made.So these are the criteria that I have formulated as my personal guide to what I look for when I'm reading a blog posting.Informative - Above all I want to learn something new when I go to a blog, so I'm looking for useful informative original content.Complete - I look for postings that are 'complete' in that you can read them and learn something from them without having to go off to lots of other place.Non commercial - Like most people in education, I don't have much time or money to throw around and would prefer to read about free resources rather than 'advertorials'.Appropriate to the medium - A blog is very specific medium. The best bloggers I think are people who understand the medium and can get the tone and length right and structure their message within those confines.Transferable - When I read a blog I'm not content just to absorb the message, I want to be able to take it and transfer it to what I do.Anyway, enough of criteria. Here are my favourites from the blog postings that were submitted.My FavouritesI really enjoyed Model United Nations: a Teacher’s Guide from Dave's Big in Japan Blog. The posting is a guide to creating Model United Nations course. It's a really useful posting that delivers exactly what it says on the box in a clear concise and well structured way. There's enough information there to actually take away and try it yourself and he's even included some downloadable worksheets to help you do that. Despite being based in Japan, what he has written here can be transferred to any teaching context in any country. Fantastic! Dave also submitted an article on Preparing students for speech and debate contests that is well worth a read. This posting on the Literacy Cycle from Dorothy Burt of the Manaiakalani blog is another great example of a concisely written and well structured posting. Dorothy has managed to cram a great deal of information and observations gained over the process of two years into one very readable posting. A good read for anyone interested in e-learning of English.I also really liked this posting from Özge Karaoğlu's blog on Digital Story Telling and got quite involved in the discussion on it. Again, this is a well written concise posting with lots of information to take away and use as well as some good examples. This is an area that fascinates me too and one that students really enjoy. The information given in the blog is also transferable to pretty much any country or Internet connected teaching context.Next on my list of favourites is Larry Ferlazzo's The Best Sites For K-12 Intermediate English Language Learners. It always amazes me how Larry can not only find all these sites, but that he is able to 'quality control' them too. The list is concise gives clear descriptions and all the sites he recommends are there because they are great. So many links collections focus on quantity and then still leave you sifting through the rubbish to find what you want. I went through all the links in this page and could use all of them. Great stuff.Another posting that I really enjoyed and ended up getting involved in was from Carl Dowse and was on Using Second Life to teach Business English. Again this is a well written post and it makes good use of other media such as video and images. Carl's obviously put a lot of time and thought into the posting and best of all has moved beyond the medium as 'broadcast' and has opened up debate on the topic. Nice one.I like this post 'I dislike the word homework' for a similar reason. The writer, Karenne Joy Sylvester, has been able to move beyond broadcasting her ideas and has been able to prompt others to write in and share their experiences and ideas on a very simple yet common topic. Exploiting this collaborative potential is one of the real challenges and opportunities of blogs.When Will the Visual Revolution Get to our Classrooms? This is what Carla Arena asks in her posting on the power of digital images and video to convey meaning and engage our students. This posting is a well structured argument in support of greater integration of digital imagery into our classrooms.The last of my favourites is Six computer games to use in an English language classroom from Lindsay Clandfield's Six Things blog. This again is a concise well written posting with plenty of practical information. The use of computer games in education is a hot topic at the moment and this posting offers an easy way in for language teachers that want to check this out.As well as these favourites there were also some other pretty impressive postings submitted.This is a posting that I actually disagree with, but it is none the less a good example of a well structured and argued blog posting. Standardized Testing is a necessary evil was written by Leigh Thelmadatter and posted on the Mexico Teacher's Alliance Ning site. Be sure to read it if you are interested in testing and assessment.I enjoyed Don’t Date The Boss. Have A Meeting With Her Instead again by Karenne Joy Sylvester. Much as I loved the poem and images as a way of correcting errors I was less clear about who it was directed at, teachers or students. It seemed to be addressing teachers at the beginning with advice for students at the end, so what wasn't so clear was how to transfer the information here to my own context. I also really enjoyed Susana Canelo's Del Valle Film Festival, though not so much because of the blog posting but because of the Wiki that it linked to and the students work included there. I was left wanting to know how Susan had set up the 'Picture our song' activity that led to these great videos.In a similar vein I enjoyed seeing this posting from Mr Stout's Blog for Students and Teachers, but was left wanting to see more and wondering how he had got his students to create these videos, so that I could perhaps try this project myself.Well that's the end of my first blog carnival and I hope that the people who have submitted posts that weren't included here aren't too offended. What's above is my personal choice based against my own criteria and it's quite possible that others would make a different selection. For anyone who wants to have a look at the complete set of entries, you can see them in one of my boxes on Simply Box.Blog Carnival submissionsFor anyone who wants to submit a post to the next blog carnival. It will be hosted on Alice Mercer's blog and you can submit a posting at: http://blogcarnival.com/bc/eprof_28891.htmlAlice teaches English Language Learners in Sacramento, and will host the June 1st edition of the Blog Carnival.Lastly, thanks again to Larry Ferlazzo for asking me to host this carnival and apologies for getting it up a few days late.Related links:Naming My Sources: Part 2Creating a personal homepageNaming My Sources: Part 1Quick ShoutNik's Daily English ActivitiesBestNik Peachey"},

{"title": "A Speed Reader that Chunks", "date": "Wednesday 18 March 2009", "text": "I've seen and tried quite a few speed reader tools recently, but Eyercize is the best one so far. I think this is mainly because it has a few really nice controls that can help to actually reinforce the way we read naturally (in chunks rather than word by word).To try out Eyercize, just copy a text that you want to read, go to: http://www.eyercize.com/ and paste it into the text filed. Then just click on 'Now Read it'This will take you to a page where you have some controls on the left hand side. The controls enable you to adjust the speed of the text and also the number of words in each chunk. They also allow you to control the number of words from the surrounding text that are shown.  These are some very handy features. It also seems like Eyercize can also detect some punctuation and headings so it doesn't chunk across sentences and paragraphs.Eyercize also provide a handy bookmarklet, which you can drag onto you browser and then just click when you want to speed read some text. See Tools to find out how it works. I think Eyercize is a handy tool to use, especially with language students, to build up good reading habits and to help to transfer their existing L1 reading habits to a new language.It might be interesting to contrast this with the text based gifs created by Sceedbot. Screedbot enables to to input a text and then  create a typewriter effect gif from it.This is a handy tool for some things, but it certainly doesn't compliment the way we read naturally.it might be useful to contrast the output from these two tools to draw trainee teachers attention to how good readers read or perhaps even with students.Hope you enjoy these tools and find good uses for them.Check out my EFL ESL reading activitiesSource of the Screedbot text is an article that I wrote for the TeachingEnglish website: 'Listening to Body Language'Related links:Create EFL / ESL Lesson Plans in MinsAdventure Narratives for EFL ESL StudentsUsing Word Clouds in EFL ESLPrompting reading speedsAI and Chat Bots for EFL ESLBestNik Peachey"},

I often wonder how long a future we have and how long it will be before voice activated translation systems can replace the need to learn another language. I wonder how many of us or our students would still have the discipline to learn a language for the joy of really being ale to speak it, if they didn't have to????Anyway, here are some differing views.Mario RinvolucriInterview with Mario RinvolucriRod BolithoInterview with Rod BolithoJenny JohnsonInterview with Jenny JohnsonThere has been a whole series of these interviews with each of the guest writers that have blogged on the site, so others worth checking out are:Dave WillisJane WilisBarry TomalinHope you enjoy these and find them useful.Related links:Teachers' StoriesELT classroom videosWould you recommend this?Conference presentation videosEnglish OnlineBestNik Peachey"},
{"title": "Understanding Irony", "date": "Sunday 15 March 2009", "text": "Understanding humour and irony in a foreign language can be incredibly challenging, but is also very important. I think this is especially true of British humour which can be very dry. That's why I think one of the new features on BigThink is so useful. There are a series of clips of British writer, actor and comedian Ricky Gervais on the site and some of these give excellent examples of this kind of humour.What's also really useful is that the site also provides tape scripts, so it is possible for students to read first and then see how the intonation, facial expression and other paralinguistic features change the meaning of the words.An excellent example of this is a short clip of Gervais talking about how the economic recession has effected Celebrities.CelebritiesQuick suggestionTo use this you could introduce the topic by getting your students to think about their opinions on this topic.Then get them to read the tape script and see if they agree with the celebrity.Then watch the clip and indicate on the tape script where they think he is joking or being ironic and when he is being serious.You could also get your students to try identify the paralinguistic features that indicate that he isn't serious.If you would like to contrast this with more serious clips then you could tryRicky Gervais on New York Ricky Gervais on Growing Up Poor All of these clips also have great examples of very natural speaking, with lots of pauses, repetition, self correction and 'fillers'.Check out the rest of the series: Ricky GervaisCheck out more EFL ESL video based activities Hope you and your students enjoy this material.Related links:Using 'How to' videosOnline Video: For Language DevelopmentOnline Video: As CommunicationOnline Video: As Knowledge ResourceOnline Video: Authentic GenresFind out about free video editing softwareYouTube for IWBs with PicLensFree Educational TV ChannelsBestNik Peachey"},

I think they really demonstrate how web based journalism can add new dimensions to a story.One of the things that I particularly like is the multi media slide  shows, and I think these are great to use with students as the images are strong and can arouse their curiosity, and the amount of authentic text isn't too much so students with a reasonable intermediate level of English they will be prepared to struggle through it. They are also nicely categorised around themes, which makes it easier to use a group of them to design materials around.Suggestion for a travel lessonThis is a very simple idea that I came up with for exploiting the travel slide shows.Just give your students the links to 3 or 4 of the different travel destinations. Ask them to watch and read the slide shows and decide which of the places they would most like to visit for a holiday. Make sure they justify their decision, the ask them to discuss or write about what they would do or see there and who and what they would take with them.If your students choose different destinations you could pair them and ask them to persuade their partner to change destinations and come to the place they want to go.Here are some of the destinations they could choose:MarrakeshMadridCape CodThailandIndiaColoradoWell I hope you and your students enjoy some of these marvelous images.

{"title": "Art Photography as a Basis for Language Activities", "date": "Tuesday 10 March 2009", "text": "I've always loved and been moved and inspired by great photographs and I have always found them to be powerful prompts for language and communication. I think the power of images goes all the way back to cave painting which was our earliest form of asynchronous communication.So whenever I see site with great images on I try to think about how they could be used with language students. Simon Hoegsberg's site is one such site. It's not just that these are great images, they are also powerful themes and he has also understood the potential of  websites to deliver these images.You can see some of his photographic projects at: http://www.simonhoegsberg.com/Some of the projects I think would have the most immediate use would be 'Faces of New York'. A collection of images of 10 New Yorkers talking about their faces. This could act as a nice model to get students doing a similar thing or be great as a split reading with students having information about the different people and having to connect it to the correct face.I also like this one with the rather morbid title of 'We're All Gonna Die Sometime - 100 Metres of Existence'  which is a 100 meter long horizontal image of people taken walking over a bridge. It's a great one for getting students to identify people by their descriptions and to describe them.Anyway, it's certainly worth checking out the other projects, though some of the image are quite strong and not recommended for younger learners.Hope you enjoy these. If you like using images in language teaching it's also well worth checking out the Images4Education group, a group of educators who collaborate to develop teaching ideas that exploit web based image technologies.

The site is like a YouTube for aspiring animators. they can upload their videos and interact on the Aniboom communities. The site pushes the quality videos to the front page so it's quite easy to find the 'good stuff'.These kinds of movies are great to use with students as they are short and engaging and a lot of the communicative message is covered by the visual aspect, so you can even exploit many of these videos with lower level language learners.There's a section of the site called 'Produce' which has series of animated movies that have been created for the site, so you could use these to build up a series of lessons for your students.I also really like the 'Create' section which has a couple of nice tools to get students creating their own short animated movies and gifs.One is called 'Shapeshifter' and it's a free online software for creating 2D animation. There's a video tutorial here showing how it works: Shapeshifter tutorialThe other is called 'Micro-Smotion' and it allows students to create animations using their webcam. They can then post these to blogs, Facebook etc or email them to friends.There are even some free basic lessons in animation on Animate 101So lots to do on Aniboom and well worth a visit.

{"title": "Subtitle Movie Fun", "date": "Friday 27 February 2009", "text": "We often forget just how much communicative meaning comes from visual clues rather than linguistic information. This site is a great one for reminding students of just how much of the communicative message they can pick up just by using their eyes. It's also a lot of fun, particularly for anyone like me who likes Indian movies.The site is called BombayTV and it has a collection of Indian film clips. Each is quite short and has space for you to add 3 lines of subtitles. You can select from a range of clips then add the subtitles and then either send it to a friend, get a URL or best of all, get an embed code to add it to your blog.Here's one I created.It's really easy to do, just go to BombayTV and click on 'Make a Movie'.You should then see the movie player with the movie index. Select a movie and watch it in the player, then write your subtitles in the fields at the side.Once you have done this you can send it to yourself to get the URL. After sending it you will also see a text to click to get the embed code and you can copy and past this into a blog.You can choose whether you get your students to guess what they think the characters are really say or just make up some dialogue of their own. Hope you have some fun with this, and if you enjoy it, then you also check out BombayTV2 which allows you to select a number of scenes and build a sequence, of Futebol TV which has clips of football matches and your students can type in commentary.I owe a big thank you Özge Karaoğlu  as I first spotted BombayTV over at her blog on the BBC | British Council Teaching English website.

They then create a 'look' by dragging in various articles of clothing from the tabs at the sides.They can even add text and label the articles they have added, add different backgrounds and even match their 'look' to a style of music by dragging in album covers.Nice one for the girls and perhaps even the boys too.If you register you can save the various 'looks' you create. The website does have a commercial side to it as it is a showcase for different products, so be sure your students don't start getting out their credit cards, unless of course they are old enough and do actually want to buy some of the products.Students can have fun creating labelling and comparing 'looks'. They could see who could come up with the best look for a particular type of music, or even see if they can create a 'makeover' look for their teacher!!Hope you have fun with this.Related links:Creating Word ListsMulti Player Vocabulary RevisionCreate Flashcard PacksVideo Dictionary 2.0A Tool for Comparing Words30 + activities to help develop vocabularyBestNik Peachey"},

Their edits show up highlighted and various versions along the way are stored so you can always track back to see who has done what.I know you can do all this and more with Google Docs, but writewith looks simpler, and simple is always good in my book,  and doesn't require that you have a Gmail account of any kind, though it does require registration.It's also quite easy to specify different tasks and also set deadlines by which time they should be done, so that would seem to work really nicely with the kind of work flow you could set up to get your students written homework done and marked online.Another nice feature is that you don't have to have a word .doc, you can just start typing your text in online and then just save it. The interface has all the normal formatting tools you would expect on a standard word processor too and you can even switch to an html view which I guess means you can add code and embed other online objects into the page.There's a short video clip from the creators here showing the basics of how it works.

The site then scans their image and selects a set of celebrities that they look like. Here are some of my matches!Can't really say I'm flattered! I also tried matching myself to female celebrities (just curiosity) and got these results. Could I really be the Carmen Electra of ELT? Um! Doubt it!Well I'm not really sure that Celebrity Matchup works, but I think you could have a lot of fun and discussion with your students deciding which is the closest match and what the differences and similarities of the facial features are. I'm sure there's a really good facial characteristics lesson in there somewhere with lots of vocabulary.Anyway, if you or your students really like the matches you get you can even get a widget to add your results to your blog or website.Just by clicking on the image you see above once you've matched up and pasting the code into your blog.Well I hope you enjoy that and match up to some flattering celebrities, but do watch out for the advertising.Related links:Photo Fun with Your StudentsPersonalised flashcardsAnimating vocabularyA Picture's worthManga images for EFL ESLCreate an English CartoonGuess the WordPlay Games and Improve Your VocabularyBestNik Peachey"},

You can set up tasks which get them to choose correct video recordings or select, process and reformulate information from a number of sources on a theme.It would be interesting what conclusions you could draw about English teaching around the world from the example above!!YouEmbedTube is a really handy little tool that's free, quick and easy to use and looks professional. The down sides are that the ones it selects are likely to change as it refreshes each time the page loads, and of course you can't select and reject the videos that appear, you can only control how many appear. I still think it has a lot of potential for educational exploitation though.I did try pulling in video from my own YouTube channel by typing in my channel name, so if you create your own channel and then add videos, this would be a good option.Hope you find it useful.Related links:Create a Flickr MontageVideo Clips for Teaching EnglishTutorial: Using Videos from YouTubeLanguage Learning through Communal VideoExploiting a Video Viral12 Second Video Clips for EFL ESLVideo conferencing for EFLBestNik Peachey"},

I can't think of any blog that comes close to competing in this category (Apologies to other blog writers)http://larryferlazzo.edublogs.org/larry-ferlazzos-english-website/Best teacher blogI think Box of Tricks is another great site that so clearly draws on real classroom experience of using technology with students. The content has real depth and insight as well as being informatively written. Also really well designed.http://www.boxoftricks.netBest educational tech support blogOkay, so MakeUseOf isn't designed to be an 'educational' tech support blog, but I have to sat that when I need support finding out about the different tech resources available and how to use them it's the first place I go and usually the last, so ...http://www.makeuseof.com/Best educational use of video / visualTEFL Clips is a site that I wrote about recently on Quick Shout. I've chosen this one because it has complete, well written lesson plans that use authentic materials from YouTube.

{"title": "Create a Flickr Montage", "date": "Saturday 29 November 2008", "text": "I just spotted Flickrin which is a really nice site that exploits flickr images and helps you to create a photo montage, like the ones below, that can be embedded into a blog or web page.It's very easy to use, just type in a username or tag keyword, decide how many rows of images you would like and then click on 'generate'.It's then just a simple matter of copying the code and pasting it into your blog or website html.All the images that appear in the montage are hyperlinked to the original image on flickr, and you can select anything from 1 to 10 rows of images.This is a really handy tool for teaching and you could use it in a number of ways, like getting students to create their own picture dictionaries (The strong visual images should help them to remember words)You could also create a montage and get the students to guess the word used. There's an activity here designed around a similar idea: Guess the WordIt might also be a useful tool for exploring the lexical fields or particular words and see how they can be used to describe different things. For example I created this montage by typing in the word 'fire'. This demonstrates some the various ways the word can be used.Range of lexical use. The tag word here was 'fire'.What I haven't discovered yet, is whether the montage is regenerated each time the page is opened. It's likely that it is, and this could mean that the montage changes as other flickr  users add images with the same tag word. You can also get some interesting images by using more than one tag word. This seems to pull in images that carry both words as tags.I spotted this tool along with some other interesting stuff on the Life is a Feast blog which belongs to Ana Maria, a teacher from Brazil.Hope you enjoy Flickrin  and find some good uses for it.Related links:Create Image BooksGreat Time Line ToolPicture phrasesMake Your EFL ESL YearbookPersonalised flashcardsAnimating vocabularyExploiting Image SequencesDevelop Your VocabularyVocabulary SequencesBestNik Peachey"},

The lesson plans are very creative, each one taking a unique approach to the materials and many have links to additional digital materials too.The site is nicely designed and focuses on delivering the materials rather than incorporating a lot of  slow loading 'sticky' content. There's also a link to a clips resource page which has a lot of useful clips if you want to create your own lessons.This is a really useful site for EFL teachers looking for ready made lesson plans or some inspiration or good ideas on how to create their own.

You can also listen to news reports and check out report data. Your staff will also help you with some analysis of the data.You are competing against other companies (These can be controlled by real people or in practice mode against the computer). When you are ready, you submit you business plan for the quarter and then find out how your company did against the market.You can then go back to your staff and listen to their opinions on what you should change. You can adjust prices of your product as well as things like the amount you spend on marketing and R&D. You can play for up to 15 quarters.The level of the language is quite high, but the audio is backed up with text bubbles and for a reasonably good intermediate class of business English students it should be vocabulary rich and challenging, but not beyond them.Students do need to register and will need to submit an email address, but it is free, doesn't require any downloads or software, will run in most browsers and was built for educational purposes, so it should be pretty safe for teenage students too.Hope you enjoy this.Related links:Playing the Stock MarketAdvertisement ProjectUsing 'How to' videosCreate an Online CV in EnglishBestNik Peachey"},

The videos that have been added have transcripts that appear under the video as they play and that are broken down into sections at the side if you click to see the transcript. (There's a tutorial on their blog here showing how to upload a video)As you watch you can also click on the words from the transcript and get definitions and create your own flashcards with definitions or translations to help you remember and revise the words.You can also create notes and ask questions about the videos and answer other people's questions. In this way user work together to to negotiate meaning and to help each other understand the content and create learning activities for each other.Personally I think LangoLAB is a great idea and a wonderful way to learn a language. If the site develops an enthusiastic community, then I think it could be a huge success and provide a really useful tool for people of all languages who want to learn and share.On the down side, what I can't see is any information on privacy and what they are doing with my personal information, email address etc, so if those issues bother you, then it might be worth staying part of the passive community until this is sorted out.

Users can click through to a range of information sources related to the words, such as online dictionaries, Wikipedia, Thesaurus and even Amazon books related to the topic.Perhaps more useful though, they can also get images related to their words. They can make notes about each word and view notes from other users who have also included the same word in their word lists. (You can see how it's done on this posting for students: List Your Favourite Words )Some of the other really useful features can be found in the Tools section, where you can create a blog widget that reads from your word lists and generates a code for you to embed your own recent word or random words into your blog.You can create your own personal RSS feed from the site, or you can even track the most recent comments on the words.This is a really great tool for helping students to develop, learn and revise their vocabulary and of course it's all free.Your students will need to have an email address to set up an account and use the word list features, but if you don't want to do that you can still use the word search functions or you could set up your own new vocabulary list for your students and then create a feed to embed in a blog for them.Wordie is another of those sites that starts with a very simple idea and makes it into something really useful.

That posting used a site called FaceinHole which had some nice images that you could upload you or your student's picture to.I've just spotted another site called PhotoFunia that also has a nice collection that you could use with many of the same ideas.Here's a few examples that you or your students could use as prompts to create stories around. You could also get them to create a completely fake biography. Here's mine. See if you can decide which parts are true!!!Did you know I used to be an astronaut?Before I became a teacher I was in fashion.I also recorded a CD, but I only sold one copy. Wonder who bought it!Of course I've made some pretty influential friends too.And like every celebrity I had my own chat showAnd er!

{"title": "What Can Students Learn from the Urban Dictionary?", "date": "Wednesday 29 October 2008", "text": "I've just been struggling to write another activity for my Daily English Activities blog. I spent most of an hour browsing through the Urban Dictionary, another user created record of the modern English language.On the one hand I thought that it was a complete waste of time in terms of finding any usable materials for EFL ESL students, but on the other hand I found it to be a really fascinating doorway into our modern culture and lifestyle.The Urban dictionary is largely a user generated and edited collection of 'invented' words, some of which are gradually becoming part of our mainstream language, such as 'muffin tops' and 'spin doctor', whereas others .... well who knows? Will mass merchanditis and boyfriend drop soon become part of your everyday vocabulary?In the end I decided to go ahead and use the site, as I thought that the cultural information in the content was so valuable. These are the word and definitions that I've chosen to use, and I think they give some valuable insights into our modern culture.

You can create a scene an a series of movies simply by choosing back drops and characters, writing your script for them and then just drop on different actions and sound effects.This is an example that took me about 10 - 15 mins to create (Took me a while to work out that you had to write the script first - Der!!)In many ways this is a similar tool to one of my long term favourites DFilm, which I wrote about some time ago in Make you own animated movies, though this is perhaps even better as the characters take your script and actually say it using the wonders of text to speech.Xtranormal is a great tool for generating listening and writing activities, as well as being a lot of fun. I hope to be publishing some teaching tips for it soon.At present the site is still n beta and it says that it is free to use for now, which makes me think you should use it now as they might start charging soon.Anyway, hope you enjoy it.Related links:Text to Speech Movies for EFL ESLMake you own animated moviesCreate an English CartoonAnimated EFL ESL Writing PromptsCreating audio-visual monologuesText to Speech for EFL ESL MaterialsArtificial Intelligence Chat bots and EFL ESLBestNik Peachey"},
{"title": "Killer Apps in Second Life", "date": "Tuesday 28 October 2008", "text": "Well anyone who keeps up with this blog on a regular basis will know that last Sunday (26th Oct 08) was my debut as a chat show host in Second Life.Firstly I have to thank Gavin Dudeney from The Consultants-E for being my first guest and of course for sponsoring the series which will be taking place on his Edunation Island. Here's a quick clip of Gavin telling me about his 'Killer app' in Second Life and how he got pulled into working in Second Life.The  experience of being the show host was actually very enjoyable, even if somewhat surreal, with a native American appearing in loin cloth in the middle of the coffee table and at one point a young girl avatar running through the wall and into the audience!Gavin was a very informative guest and talked about some of the difficulties and challenges of teaching language in Second Life as well as some of the amazing potential that virtual worlds offer for education.We hope over the coming few days to be able to make the complete audio available for anyone who missed the event and wants to hear what Gavin had to say. Here are just some of the questions that Gavin answered:What goes on at Edunation Islands 1 - 3 and what kind of people / institution are setting up business here?Who comes on your TT courses? What’s thee typical profile?The course uses Moodle with SL. Why the combination and will SL make Moodle redundant?Could you tell us about the free teaching tools you’ve created?Do you think SL is a viable place to for commercial language schools to make money from teaching?Is communication in virtual worlds a new ‘genre’ of communication? Are the skills needed different?It's often said that online learning isn’t suitable for beginners. Can beginners learn languages online in SL?How can you over come the sense of coldness and lack of reaction while teaching in SL?How should languages be taught in SL? Should schools be replicating classrooms?What future developments would you like to see?  What would you ask Linden Lab to develop to make language teaching more effective?Is there a ‘killer app’ or characteristic that made you want to dedicate so much time to SL?Have you thought about SL competitors and which ones would you consider shifting to?For anyone thinking about getting involved in Second Life Education then check out the information on The Consultants-E website where you can find out about their training courses for teachers. Also worth checking out is Gavin's Blog That'SLife.Hope you enjoy the clip.

{"title": "Creating a Nation", "date": "Thursday 23 October 2008", "text": "Back in my classroom days I used to play a simulation game which my students always enjoyed. They were given a budget and country to run and they had to work in groups to decide how they would spend the budget to protect and develop their country.Cyber Nations seems to have taken that game one step further and created an online simulation which students can play over a period of time. Actually 'one step further' is a bit of an understatement, as once players have created their nation and started to develop it and decide on the budget, taxes and governmental policies etc. they are then launched into competition with other nations that other players have created.They have the chance to develop alliances, form trade partnerships and even attack or aid other countries.This is a wonderful way to get students talking, reading, thinking and experimenting. You could either get students to form nations in small groups, alone, or you could have a class nation which you ruled democratically as a class project making new decisions each class.The site is free, but it does require a password to register and activate your account.Hope you enjoy this and find the time to get your students playing it.Related links:Educational Games That Really Are FunOnline Water Conservation GameWonderland Virtual World and MMORPGGoogle's Lively Competitor with Second Life? 3B Village 3D browserEco City GameBestNik Peachey"},

I'm hoping to be able to create a video recording of the show and decided to see how well I could record video and use the lip synching feature to make it all look more realistic.Well here are the results.I'm actually quite impressed. I think it does add an element of realism that has been missing and greatly increases the potential of Second Life for creating Machinima or any other video or animation projects. If you want to have a go with the lip synching, this video shows you how to switch it on.To create the movie I actually used two computers each with a seperate avatar on. I then used one avatar as the 'actor' and the other avatar to record the sound and video (recording was done on a MAC running I-ShowU) I then edited it with I-Movie and uploaded directly to YouTube from there.On Sunday 26th October at GMT = 18.00 I'll be interviewing Gavin Dudeny co author of How to Teach English with Technology from The Consultants-E about his teacher training activities in Second Life.If you would like to come along and watch the show and join in the discussion, then go along to Edunation III and click the sign-up terminals or email Gavin at: dudeney@theconsultants-e.com.

Once you get past the initial, slightly stuffy, introductions, there are some clips of live classrooms and interviews with teachers which I found really interesting.The rest of the site is worth checking out too as it has professional development guides, teacher resources and a link to a Ning based discussion forum.Hope you enjoy this.Related links:Exam PracticeTry a TOEFL Listening TestTry a TOEFL Reading TestBestNik Peachey"},
{"title": "Writing Project Community", "date": "Monday 13 October 2008", "text": "WeBook is a great tool for writing projects. The great thing about it is that you can work on a writing project collaboratively, and submit it to the community for feedback and advice. Once you feel your writing is finished you can also enter it into a poll and WeBooks is even proposing to publish some work if enough people like it.It seems like a great tool for EFL ESL writing projects as it offers your students the opportunity to get feedback from other people.There are also some nice writing support tools in the 'Toolbox' section. I especially like the 911 writers' block tool and the writing tips in the Writing secrets section.This is definitely a site for adults rather than young learners, as there are community elements and some of the writing is more adult orientated, but for general English students' writing projects I think this is a nice way to add extra motivation to writing tasks and adopt a more process writing approach. There's also quite  large group of writers there discussing each other's work and helping with tips, sharing experience too, so that could also make interesting reading.Hope you enjoy it.Related links:5 Minutes of Daily LiteratureFree Web Publishing CommunityPrompting reading speeds Animating vocabulary BestNik Peachey"},

Scribd is a web publishing community which uses a tool that looks very similar to Flash Paper to enable users to upload and share documents ranging from single pages to complete books.There's a really wide selection of books and documents uploaded that you can search through, and if you register, you can also start adding your own documents and projects.The 'reader' part of the site delivers high quality at quite good speeds and you can also get an embed code so you can add the books to your site or blog and build tasks etc. around them. Here's a quick example of a short document on how to teach poetry:                                      Poetry is Contagious - How to Teach Poetry (Betsey Coleman) - Upload a Document to ScribdAdding the embed code to this page took just a couple of seconds and I didn't need to register to get it. You just need to register if you want to upload documents.If you go to Explore and look through the education section there are at least 1000 books or documents there all of which are free. Some really handy ones on teaching and also quite a few dictionaries including the Dictionary of English Slang.Scribd is definitely a site I want to spend more time on, might even use it to make an e-book version of my Learning Technology blog.Hope you find something useful.Related links:Fantastic Free E-Books for EFL and ELTFree ebooks on elearningFree PDF EditorBestNik Peachey"},
{"title": "New Social Network Creation Tool", "date": "Thursday 9 October 2008", "text": "I've been having a look at a new social network creation tool called SocialGo and I have to say it has a couple of very tempting features, especially for creating language learning networks.I've been using Ning for a number of projects, (See my posting on Create your own social network 7 steps ) but thought I'd have a quick look at SocialGo and see what it has to offer. I registered with the site and managed to create a new social network platform in just a few minutes.My first impressions were that it was very similar to Ning.  It seems to provide the same kind of basic structure and ability to add in similar gadgets etc.For me though, one of the killer features in its favour is the ability it offers to support user interaction through synchronous text and video chat. I haven't tried this out yet, as at present I'm the only member on my network, but if it works I would give serious consideration to building a social network for students to support my Daily English Activities blog, as it would provide a great place for students to upload and share their work and give some peer feedback and encouragement to each other.My only reservation so far, is that some of the premium features (which will cost) are at present being offered on the free beta platforms that people create, so I don't want to end up with either a big bill or having to disable popular features later.Anyway, I think SocialGo is well worth checking out. Hope to be able to post a follow up to this in a few weeks / months. Would appreciate comments from anyone else who tries it out too.Related links:12 Second Video Clips for EFL ESLSocial Networks and the Web 2.0 Revolution: Part 2Karaoke with a Social NetworkMicroblogging for EFL with PlurkCreate your own social network 7 stepsSocial networking for language learningBestNik Peachey"},

It gives you the opportunity to access video messages and short films from around the world. Anyone with access to a camera and computer can contribute their films.\"This is pretty emotive stuff, so be careful about the age groups and how you use it with your students.

It's called Shidonni and it is similar to a paint program and allows kids to draw animals etc. The difference with  this though is that once they have drawn an animal they then click a button and it comes to life!There's more though. They can also draw items of food to put in the animal's fridge and draw habitat for it to live in.  If that's not enough they can even play games of snakes and ladders with their animal and visit other planets where other students have created their own animals. So it's bit like a paint version of Spore for young kids.Watch this movie to see how it is done I'm sure their must be loads of educational and language development uses we can put this to, so I'll be getting my thinking hat on.

You can upload videos , images , audio files, collect links and add documents.All of these are uploaded to sectioned boxes, and each section of the box is a cube with 6 sides to which you can add your media.When the box is finished you can publish and share the results and users can view the different sections of the box.I think this is a wonderful idea and a great way of publishing your students' work.  There are already quite a collection of boxes on the site, which students might find interesting.The projects don't have to be historical, you could create a box with a section for each member of your class, or students could create boxes about their local city or environmental problems.Hope you enjoy this and find it useful.Related links:Advertisement ProjectDrama project toolsStudent Made English AdvertisementsBestNik Peachey"},

It's called Hangout and is still in private beta at the moment, so if you want to have a look around you'll need to apply for an invitation.This one claims to be designed for teens and if you watch the video on the homepage, it does look as though it will appeal to that age group.It looks like each person will be able to have their own room which they will customise. The graphics look nice and there's a good level of customisation of the various rooms. They are boasting both voice and text chat and the ability to create audio playlists and videos in the rooms.It doesn't say yet if it will be free, but there is mention of credit card payments on the terms of use, though this might not be for membership.The terms of use also say that user between 13 and 17 need to get their parents approval to register, so hopefully they are taking security seriously.Anyway, this could be one to watch if you're looking for an alternative to Second Life.Related links:Photo Assignments for EFL ESL Students in Second LifeEducational Games That Really Are FunOnline Water Conservation GameWonderland Virtual World and MMORPGGoogle's Lively Competitor with Second Life? 3B Village 3D browserMachinima with MoviestormLooking at There.comMaterials design for Virtual WorldsImmersive Image EnvironmentsTeaching Speaking in Second LifeCreating multimedia storiesBestNik Peachey"},
{"title": "Educational Games That Really Are Fun", "date": "Friday 5 September 2008", "text": "It's often been a criticism of many attempts to make MMORPG computer games educational, that when that happens the fun goes. I have to say that it is often the case, but I think Power Up is an exception.Power up is an educational computer game based around the concept of helping students to understand the need for clean energy. It takes the scenario of a planet ( set in the future) which needs rescuing.The game looks and feels convincing and has some nice collaborative game play thrown in with some blasting of alien beasts. Students can play it alone or in multi-player mode. They are assigned missions that they have to complete and there is even use of some text to speech.There are ready made   lesson plans for teachers as well as a section for parents with advice on child safety.The game is free, but you will have to download the software (200Mb!) which takes about 40Mins on a good broadband connection (and lots longer on a bad one)It's great that the quality of these games is improving so much. This would be a really motivating game for students to play to learn more about clean energy and also good for intermediate + EFL ESL students as they would need to work at understanding the instructions to progress through the game. Also great to base a CLIL lesson around.Definitely a serious game to be taken seriously.

It has similar gameplay to something like Zoo Tycoon, with students making budgeting decisions and deciding what areas to develop each year for 50 years.Students have to manage a catchment area, protect the environment, develop the agricultural resources and balance this against conserving water and water quality.There's a good video demo here showing how it's done: How to playI had a go at this game and was fascinated. The language level is quite high, so non native speakers of English would need to be of a good level to cope without a lot of support. It would be a great way of developing their environment related vocabulary though.It's great to see educational games are really being taken seriously in Australia. This is a great example of game that can really make students think, but still keep them motivated.Related links:Wonderland Virtual World and MMORPGGoogle's Lively Competitor with Second Life? 3B Village 3D browserMachinima with MoviestormLooking at There.comMaterials design for Virtual WorldsImmersive Image EnvironmentsTeaching Speaking in Second LifeCreating multimedia storiesBestNik Peachey"},

{"title": "Multimedia Vocabulary Website", "date": "Tuesday 2 September 2008", "text": "Babbel is one of the few really effective vocabulary building websites that I've seen on the web. It's actually a social network and can help you to make friends for language exchange etc, but the core of the site is it's interactive multimedia vocabulary building exercises.These work with words being presented along with images and the sounds of the words. The exercises then move on to recognition of the sounds of the words and then you have to spell out the words for the images as you see and hear them. I know this all sounds a bit PPP (Present, Practice, Produce) but for EFL or MFL students working alone, I still think there is some value in  this.The site isn't only for learners of English, but also has exercises in Italian, French, German and Spanish.This is one of the great strengths of the site because it draws on students from more languages, it makes it possible for students to connect with and practice their language with users from the target language.As always it would be wise to be careful with this and to protect your students' privacy etc, but there certainly is some potential here and I do like the design of the vocabulary building activities so for that alone, it's worth the free registration.Hope you enjoy it.Related links:Multi Player Vocabulary RevisionMultimedia wordsearchAnimating vocabularyGames With a Purpose and a Social NetworkImprove your Vocabulary and send Aid to ChildrenBestNik Peachey"},

The clips are arranged by age suitability ( 3 - 1 years or 11 - 19) as well as topic. All the clips I looked at also had a transcript underneath too, which is always really helpful for EFL and ESL students.There is a good collection of Business related clips for anyone teaching Business English or Business skills.There is also a huge range of historical footage going all the way back to the 1930'sThe user interface is simple and clean and the clips stream pretty quickly and still look okay when played full screen.On the whole this is a really nice resource for EFL , subject specific or CLIL lessons.Apply for you password now as it may take a little while to get one.Hope you enjoy itRelated postings:Ready Made Authentic Video materials For ESL EFLNews Videos for EFL ESL Materials DesignSubtitling your video clipsTranscribed Videos for EFL ESLUsing Product ReviewsIconic teen videoTackling political issuesVideo debating websiteAdvertisement ProjectUsing 'How to' videosBestNik Peachey"},

Well now you can.I've just been playing with Vivaty a new 3D virtual world that runs from within your web browser with only a minimal download (4.5Mb).The strange thing about it though is that it runs from within Facebook!Despite this it's quite good and quite easy to set up and customise. You can also easily add pictures or videos to your own personal room. Within a few mins I had managed to add a TV screen to my room and configure it to play a video from my YouTube channel.Here's my avatar watching me doing a video presentation!Once you've downloaded the 4.5Mb program and installed it, you simply log into your face book account and your room appears at the bottom of your profile page and you just click to enter the room.There are also a selection of other rooms that you can visit if you want to meet other people to chat with.Vivaty certainly doesn't have the rich graphics and degree of customisation that you can get from something like Second Life, but it is a much smaller download, runs in your browser (Internet Explorer only - Sorry MAC only users!) and or use with EFL ESL students, it  is much safer (that's if you trust Facebook to protect your privacy!).For me though, the strongest thing in its favour is the potential to watch, share  and chat about videos whilst in a simple online environment.Related links:Google's Lively Competitor with Second Life? 3B Village 3D browserMachinima with MoviestormLooking at There.comMaterials design for Virtual WorldsImmersive Image EnvironmentsTeaching Speaking in Second LifeCreating multimedia storiesBestNik Peachey"},

If you got a whole class logged in they could learn their songs at home and compete for the highest score.I also like that the site has embedded YouTube videos of the original singers for many of the songs, so students can listen to the original and look at the lyrics ( They usually appear under the video clip) before they try to sing themselves.The site doesn't have servers available in every country yet, but even if you can't register and get a score the lyrics, video and audio to sing along with are still available.So, no more excuses.

Once you select a song to sing along with it comes up in a big pop up window which you could display full screen on an interactive whiteboard if you are brave enough to work with a whole class on a song. The words of the song change colour as you should sing them.You get a bit of help on the chorus, when the original singers join in. If you are using this with students it might be a good idea to play the complete song by the original singer before starting to get them to work on the songs on the site. That way they'll get a better sense of the timing and when to start singing.You can find more ideas for using karaoke with EFL / ESL students on my Learning Technology blog posted under the title of 'Karaoke with a Social Network'The selection of songs is also quite broad with quite a lot of up to date songs as well as some older classics. They also have some ready created playlists which are quite handy.This will certainly be a useful site once it goes public and is one of the best designed Karaoke sites I've seen.I hope you and your students are able to enjoy it soon.Related postings:Transcribed Videos for EFL ESLKaraoke with a Social NetworkBestNik Peachey"},

As students watch the clip, they see the script appearing in a window alongside.The videos  are separated by level; easy - medium - hard and are also categorised by theme, such as sport, cartoons, nature etc. There is a 'sexy' category too, but this is mainly made up of music videos and commercials and I don't think there is anything particularly 'adult' about it.You can watch all the movie clips without registering, but if you do register there is a social networking element to the site and you can also get involved with uploading and transcribing videos for the site.This is a really useful tool for students and teachers. It would be nice if you could turn off the transcription and try to get students to work it out for themselves first, but if you wanted to do this, you could just find the same clip on YouTube and then send the students to Yappr to check their transcription.Hope you enjoy this.Related postings:Using Product ReviewsIconic teen videoTackling political issuesVideo debating websiteAdvertisement ProjectUsing 'How to' videosBestNik Peachey"},

The game is based around the story of some travelers who become shipwrecked and have to survive by doing various tasks, quests and challenges.  The graphics look like the typical Japanese manga cartoons which are so popular with kids and teens.What I really like about this is that the 'things to do' type quests and challenges are already there and built in so , unlike virtual worlds like Second Life and There.com you and your students don't have to think up things to do.I think this is really good motivating game to get students using English to solve problems and work collaboratively. If you can get your students hooked on a game like this they'll do the learning for themselves.On the negative side, they will need to download the software and that's over 500Mb, so they'll need broadband and a reasonably up to date computer. The game is also quite complex and I can't find any information regarding minimum ages for registration.That said, if your students are keen gamers and have an intermediate level of English or higher and you want to motivate them to work on their own, this could be a wonderful tool for getting them to do that.BestNik PeacheyRelated postingsGoogle's Lively Competitor with Second Life? 3B Village 3D browserMachinima with MoviestormLooking at There.comMaterials design for Virtual WorldsImmersive Image EnvironmentsTeaching Speaking in Second LifeCreating multimedia stories"},

Panfu has used this premise as the basis for a new virtual world for kids in which they can play games and learn languages at the same time.They create their own panda avatar, dress the panda and have their own panda tree house to decorate and invite friends round to.On the whole this looks pretty good and I'm sure my 9 year old daughter will be keen to try this out (she's already a Webkinz fanatic). Panfu are offering two levels of membership; Free and Gold. Gold entitles your kids to get extra customisation for their panda avatar and his lodgings.Getting your kids involved in virtual worlds or any kind of social networking is always slightly risky, but it does look as though Panfu are taking this seriously.The service is available in a range of languages. If your kids register as being English, then they get to learn some Spanish, if they register as other nationalities it looks like they get to learn English.I haven't tried this one out yet myself, but it does look like a serious and well thought out educational effort. Definitely a step in the right direction.Hope your kids enjoy it.BestNik Peachey"},

I'd love to hear from anyone who has or from anyone who has other karaoke type websites to share.BestNik Peachey"},
{"title": "Google's Lively Competitor with Second Life?", "date": "Thursday 10 July 2008", "text": "Have Google joined the online 3D virtual world market? Well it looks like they have, but it looks like it's still pretty early days with the Beta release of Lively.Lively certainly seems to have a lot of potential and a lot of good things going for it, in addition to having the might of a company like Google behind it.The 3D rooms run in the browser and only require the download of a very small plugin (about half a MB) as opposed to the huge downloads that Second Life and There.com require.Anyone can create their own room, pretty quickly and easily, and embed the room into a web page like the one below.The rooms aren't connected so if you want to use this with students, it's less risky as they are less prone to 'wandering' into unsuitable areas.The amount of customization of both avatars and rooms is limited at the moment, so this might well help to discourage the more 'adult' orientated users who tend to crop up in Second Life so much.Word is that you can add and watch YouTube videos within your 3D room, which could make a nice addition to a distance course and enable your students to have film / video night together.The 3D comic book type graphics look good and would surely appeal to teens or younger learners.It's free at the moment at least. Here is my 3D room embedded into my pageBut this is what it should look like!Before you get too excited though:I've had more than a few problems getting this to work for me either in Firefox 3 or IE 7 and you can't run it on a MAC yet.Lots of the tools for editing the room and avatar that appear in the help instructions, never seem to appear on my screen, so once I've created my room, I don't seem to be able to edit it at all.There's no voice chat only text chat.Because it's only just been launched the actual population is still pretty small, so actually meeting someone to talk to is a bit of a challengeAnyway, despite all this, I think this is still one to watch, not only because it has Google behind it, but because if it can be made to work well and run in the browser with lower demand on bandwidth and small downloads, this could open up the potential of virtual worlds to many more people and that can't be a bad thing.Some of my other postings on virtual worlds.3B Village 3D browserMachinima with MoviestormLooking at There.comMaterials design for Virtual WorldsImmersive Image EnvironmentsTeaching Speaking in Second LifeCreating multimedia storiesBest Nik Peachey"},

One of the creators of this project is Edward O. Wilson and you can also find some short video clips of him talking about issues related to the environment on Big Think.

{"title": "Create your own sms groups", "date": "Monday 7 July 2008", "text": "With the vast increase in the number of people with phones capable of receiving sms, having your own group for your students seems like a pretty good idea.GupShup provides you with the ability to make this happen for free. You 'simply' register for free on their site and then start creating groups. The site has quite a few groups there already and some with more than 2,000 members. The groups are split into categories and there's a couple of pages of educational ones, which include quite a few word of the day type services.Once you register you can either send out messages to the group through the website or by using your phone.I guess the downside of this is that your students are going to be paying every time they send a message, and I've no idea what the rates are likely to be. I tried to register using my own phone here in Morocco, but never get the confirmation message with my registration code, so that's about as far as I got.Anyone else tried this?Do you know of other similar services that are free?Would be very interested in hearing comments from anyone else doing anything like this.To try GupShup go to: http://www.smsgupshup.comBestNik Peachey"},

{"title": "More Second Life Tutorials", "date": "Thursday 3 July 2008", "text": "Following on from my posting last month on building in Second Life, here are 4 more video tutorials showing the basics of Inventory management and how to create folders and notecards within the inventory.The first tutorial looks at how to open the inventory and create a new folder within it.The second tutorial looks at how to create new notecards for sharing text and activties. This for me is one of the prime sources of deliveing materials to students as the text on Notecards is much clearer easier to read and manipulate than text on textures, so I find this a key function to enable effective teaching within Second Life.The third tutorial looks at how to find things within the inventory by using the search. This can help to overcome what can be quite a frustrating problem.The forth and final tutorial in this set looks at how to clear up the inventory and delete some of the multiple instances. Keewping your inventory under control can help make it easier to find things and also speed up your avatar when you log in to Second Life, as there will be less inventory items to download.If you are new to or haven't tried Second Life yet, then I hope you find these videos useful and they encourage you to try it out. The videos were originally commissioned by The Consultants-E and are part of an introductory course for teachers they deliver on Edunation Island II and are used with their kind consent.

{"title": "Becoming a citizen journalist", "date": "Tuesday 1 July 2008", "text": "Ever thought of becoming a journalist in your free time, well now you can with Instablogs!Instablogs was brought to my notice by an email that arrived in my inbox asking me if I wanted to become a 'citizen journalist'. I have to say that the thought is quite attractive and this might be something to get students involved in on some level too.I had a quick look at the site and it is interesting and looks like a credible news site. It splits the articles geographically by continent (good to find so many countries represented rather than just the US  or Europe as is the case with so many sites) and also splits the news by topic, with the usual things like, entertainment, technology, sport, politics etc.You have to register to actually write an article and in the email I recieved it did mention payment for articles, though the amount was very small, so I don't think this would be a motivating factor.As I said, this could be quite a useful resource for students or for materials for your students, partly because it does cover such a broad geographical area, and it might well be interesting to compare some of the 'citzen' news with articles from more mainstream news sources like BBC or CNN.It might also provide your students with some great motivation for writing too as they could possibly get their work published and people have been known to launch careers from such sites!As for me, the main thing that puts me off writing for the site is that it doesn't have an education section. If it did well... I don't know.What do you think?Would you write for a site like this?Is this site an attempt to empower people or just a cynical attempt to get cheap content?Should citizens be journalists or should that be left to the 'professionals'?I'd be very interested to hear your views, so please do post a comment if you have one.BestNik Peachey"},

I have to say it looks pretty good. I browsed through a few creatures and tried altering them and then decided to create my own. Once my creature was created I was able to get it to try various  things, like dancing, calling to friends etc. I was also able to take a couple of pictures and create a video of it with its young!!!Well I know it doesn't look very attractive, but it was fun and I can't wait to see what my daughter makes of this. I'm really looking forward to the release of the complete game in September 08. I'm sure this has huge educational potential. Time to start thinking about some activties for the 'Creature Creator', though I'm not sure how many educational institutions are going to be downloading 196Mb!Anyway, if you feel like giving it a try, go along to http://www.spore.com and then click on 'get Spore' and it should take you to the page where you can download the free 'Creature Creator'.EnjoyBestNik Peachey"},
{"title": "The StockNews Game", "date": "Wednesday 18 June 2008", "text": "This is a great game for business students if the level of their English is quite good. The game works in three steps.    User reads a business news report on a company    User predicts whether the companies stock will go up or down as a result of the news    User wins or looses points as a result of their predictionThe reading part is timed so it'll force your students to do some skimming and scanning and make decisions based on that information. The level is quite high though, but for developing business vocab and as a spring board to some discussion this is a definite winner.You can keep playing for as long as you like and try to win back any losses or build up your fortune. If you register, your efforts are recorded and you can try to make it onto the top scorers board.I'm sure this is a great source of news articles for use in class too and there must be some millage in trying to understand the graphs.I actually got quite hooked on the game for a while, until I realised I was never going to be rich!You can play the StockNewsGame here:http://www.stocknewsgame.com/Hope you enjoy it.BestNik Peachey"},

The site that I'm referring to is Hot for Words! It is presented by Marina and this is how she describes herself;\"My name is Marina and I am a philologist (one who studies linguistics and etymology). I love to discuss the origins of words.\"The interesting motto for the site is 'Intelligence is sexy'. Before you jump to too many conclusions have a look at an example episode of Marina describing the origin of the word 'nuclear'.Marina is quite obviously using her sex appeal to attract users, but despite that she does seem to be delivering the goods and quite obviously has a huge following with more that 77 thousand subscribers to the Hot for Words YouTube Channel and more that 27 Million views of her videos. That certainly is a lot more than my own YouTube channel!!I found it really interesting to compare Marina's efforts with those of the BBC and their British Council Innovations award winning 'The Teacher'.Here's an episode with The Teacher introducing idioms connected with the word 'pie'.  I have to say that to watch this on my MAC I had to download 44Mb of Mp4 first!Click here if you want to do the same comparisonWell I'm not really sure which you prefer but I would be really interested to hear your comments.Which would you recommend to your students????Trainee teachers???Will Marina and Hot for Words be winning next years Innovations award?There's an interesting clip here telling a bit more about Marina and the origins of the show.Love to hear what you think so please do post a comment.BestNik Peachey"},

The Creature Creator should be available for download from Tuesday 17th June from the Spore site, though the game itself won't be released until September I believe.There's a great article on Webware which describes all the amazing Web2.0 type features that gamers will have access to. These include the ability to create video and images and upload them directly to YouTube (great for machinima projects), as well as the ability to share creations for other gamers to work on and also each creature gamers create will become part of a Wikipedia style collection of information on all the Spore creatures created.I think for educators, this must be one of the most exciting and potentially useful games ever created, as gamers will have the opportunity to design creatures from the microbial stage and nurture them and control their environment as they develop.Anyway, I'll be queuing up next week to download (300mb) of Creature Creator and start designing my own creatures. Sadly the Creature Creator part isn't free, but at just under 5 GBP it's certainly not expensive.Hope to be posting some of my own creations soon.BestNik Peachey"},

It's called Mogopop and it supposed to help users create and share multimedia projects for iPod.You have to register (for free) and this gives you your own space (up to 50Mb) to create your own projects. You can create an image and video library them create pages and add or link the media to them, then when you are ready you can publish the whole thing on the Mogopop site for other to download and enjoy.As well as creating your own projects, you can of course download other people's (if the they are public), but this involves downloading and installing the Mogopop manager (18Mb).It's pretty quick and easy to install, but you have to be using the right kind of iPod. I wasn't, so I still haven't got any of the projects onto mine, there's also no way of checking out and viewing what you download before you download it, which for me is a huge disadvantage.There is an education section and there are some promising titles in there. I also liked the interface and it did seem really easy to create projects, but downloading them and viewing them seems to be the main obstacle.Anyway, I think this is a really good idea and one that students might well enjoy, so I'm going to persist with it for a bit longer.

A lot of the articles tend to have a US focus, but there's still quite a few that don't.The language / information level is quite high so this is for speakers with a good level of English, but there's certainly plenty of information, text, images and opportunities to interact that could make this a pretty useful tool. (Terms of use)Hope you enjoy it.BestNik"},
{"title": "Eco City Game", "date": "Tuesday 4 March 2008", "text": "ElectroCity is an interesting online game designed for education. It's based around the SimsCity principle and users have to try to build a financially viable eco city where all the inhabitants can also be happy.As I said the game was designed for education and there's a very handy teachers section with some downloadable worksheets. The producer put the level of the game at 7 - 9 year olds, but if you were using this with non English speakers for language development I think you could use it with any aga range and there would still be a good deal of motivation to try it.There's also a downloadable version of the game for those with slower connections and wonder of wonders there is both a PC and a MAC version. It's quite a small download too ( 1 - 2 Mb). You can find these in the teachers' resources section.You can also have a look at some of the cities other players have created.If you register you can also enter your students in a competition to win a prize for the best designed city and students can keep track of how well there city is doing.This looks like a really handy educational game.Hope you enjoy it.BestNik"},
{"title": "English Online", "date": "Friday 29 February 2008", "text": "Please forgive more than a hint of self promotion (Well I am a blogger so what can you expect?) in this posting. I've recently written an Action Research Toolkit, aimed mainly at language teachers, but it may well be of use to teachers in other disciplines too, which has now been published on a pretty impressive new British Council website in China.The action research toolkit is split into various components with articles on a possible research cycle, planning research as well as suggestions for how to use video and audio recordings in your research, how to design questionnaires and even some downloadable tasks and tip sheets.You can download the complete kit from hereThe Toolkit is part of the British Council in China's English Online  site which has been designed with sections for both teachers and learners.The section for teachers has some pretty handy tools like a flashcard archive , some video footage from inside the classroom (which is always useful and often hard to find) as well as a photo library for teachers to use.What I like best about the site though is that it's one of the British Council's  bravest attempts to really build a site that is very 'Web 2.0'. They have really tried to take on board and encourage the building of a sense of ownership and community within the site's user base.Registered users can create their own blogs, get involved in forums and vote, comment on and rate the content.I think this is a bold step forward for the British Council and a site that's well worth checking out whether you are based in China or not.BestNik"},

{"title": "Football vocabulary", "date": "Wednesday 27 February 2008", "text": "This is a great free online game called GoalUnited. It isn't designed for education at all but I'm sure anyone who is keen on developing their English and has an interest in football would enjoy it and get a lot of vocabulary and reading practice from it.The game is played in a similar manner to the popular Football manager computer game and each player builds up a team and plays against other teams online.As I said it's free. It is available to play in other languages too so make sure your students choose to play it in the language they want to learn rather than the one they already speak.I'm not really a football fan myself so I haven't really spent time with this, but for students that are, I'm sure it could be very motivational.English version is hereTo choose from other languages try hereHope you enjoy it.BestNik"},

There is an audio of a word and students have to choose the correct synonym (there's a choice of four). For every correct answer Free Rice donates 20 grains of rice.The site also rates the level of your vocabulary and sneds you more difficult questions if you are getting the answers.Great vocabulary building and a worthy charity all in one.I found it pretty addictive.

{"title": "Tackling Race Issues", "date": "Friday 22 February 2008", "text": "This week the Big Think is running a feature to coincide with Black History Month. It includes videos from Black American leaders from a wide range of fields and backgrounds giving their thoughts and reflections on race and identity issues.This is great material for basing lessons around and should promote a lot of discussion within your classroom.As ever with sensitive issues, you'll have to handle this carefully, but watching the videos is a good way of raising awareness, without having to tackle the issues head-on.Here's an example of one of the videos.You can check out some of the other videos at: http://www.bigthink.com/user/nelson-georgehttp://www.bigthink.com/user/kwame-anthony-appiahFor a more complete review of Big Think have a look at my Learning Technology Teacher Development Blog at:http://nikpeachey.blogspot.com/2008/01/video-debating-website.htmlHope you find this material useful.bestNik"},

It enables you to convert and even edit DVDs so that you can play them on other devices. This includes a range of mobile devices like i-pod and Sony PSP as well as just playing them on your computer / TV.It also gives you the option of copying them with the subtitles showing or just saving particular scenes and reduces the file sizes for storing back ups of your DVDs.It's really useful and runs on a range of platforms MAC and Linux as well as Windows.Hope you find it useful, but remember to respect copyright laws.BestNik"},

{"title": "Free video editing software", "date": "Saturday 9 February 2008", "text": "I just spotted this rather nice simple video editing suite from Pinnacle. It's free to download (150Mb) and has quite a few nice features that put it above the standard Microsoft video editor.It supports flash and direct upload to YouTube, it also enables you to save your movies in a number of formats, many of which are compatible with a range of mobile devices such as i-pod and Sony PSP.I've downlaoded it and it seems pretty easy to use. You can add transitions, text , music sound effects etc.The catch is that if you want to keep using the codecs that enable you to export to DivX and Mepg2 - 4, then after a 15 day trial you'll need to buy those. Not sure yet how much they are though.You can download it from: http://videospin.com/If you don't need those, then this is a really handy video editor for free.It runs on Vista and XP, but not MAC, but then if you have a MAC you won't need it.Hope you find this usefulBestNik"},
{"title": "Temporary bookmarking", "date": "Wednesday 6 February 2008", "text": "This is something I'm finding really useful right now. It's called Instapaper and it's something similar to a temporary bookmarking system. If you go to the site and create a log in, you can then drag a small icon from the page and onto your bookmarks tool bar. The icon looks like this:Once the icon is in your tool bar you simply click it every time you find a page or an article on the web that you would like to read later (but don't have time at the moment) and it will create an entry on your Instapaper account page.Then when you have time to read you go to the page and click on the links to the articles you want to read. The site then marks them read, allows you to delete them or if you prefer you can annotate them and keep them saved.This must be a really handy tool for anyone doing web based research. It saves you having to  bookmark a whole lot of stuff that you might want to delete later and is really quick and easy to set up and use.Unfortunately, it won't read the articles for you though. Wonderful little tool, hope you find it useful.BestNik"},

It's amazing to see how many big brands now have a presence in a virtual world of some kind. It's especially surprising that Coca-Cola are using There.com as it has had none of the high profile publicity that Second Life has attracted. It may well be that There.com as attracted a big proportion of the younger age group that CC want to market to. There.com certainly has a much younger and lighter feel that SL and it does seem to be designed more around the concept of having fun ( in a less adult way).Anyway it's good to see that Second Life isn't the only player and that big companies are looking beyond that and taking other virtual worlds seriously as a place to promote their brand.Read There Fun Times article on Coca-Cola partnershipRead my learning technology article on There.com"},
